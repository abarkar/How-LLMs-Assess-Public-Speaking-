{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-11-19T12:32:27.618593355Z","response":"The text appears to be a transcript of a presentation or speech about the concept of \"masque\" (mask) in psychology and its relation to social roles and identity. The speaker, a clinical psychologist, draws parallels between the idea of wearing a mask to adapt to societal expectations and the way people present themselves in everyday life.\n\nThe text mentions the work of Sigmund Freud and his concept of the \"principle of reality,\" where individuals learn to adopt certain roles or personas to fit in with society. However, this can lead to feelings of suffocation and the need to remove these masks to reveal one's true self.\n\nThe speaker shares their experience working with patients in an addiction treatment center using a mask-making activity as a therapeutic tool. The process involves creating a mask and then improvising a scene while wearing it, which allows participants to explore different aspects of themselves and express emotions safely.\n\nThe main point of the presentation seems to be that the act of removing one's mask is not just about revealing one's true self, but also about acknowledging the masks we wear in everyday life and the social pressures that shape our identities. The speaker suggests that this process can lead to a greater sense of mobility and freedom for individuals.\n\nThe text also includes some humorous asides and rhetorical questions, such as \"Si vous n'êtes pas pareil, Bein métra pas !\" (If you're not alike, then don't be like that!). Overall, the presentation appears to be a thought-provoking exploration of the complexities of human identity and the role of masks in shaping our selves.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,12095,4864,9189,834,12769,9427,593,65801,9189,73953,89,25692,85815,8065,1841,3807,278,409,29959,11,3869,653,6485,68,45705,266,519,5019,514,2145,425,11,6033,35597,3869,11641,3341,8233,7010,514,4632,578,20519,11,1880,272,17771,25692,85815,409,3846,62891,1744,513,436,16082,1557,514,5636,7643,38317,665,8841,38469,9400,2428,13,2998,77824,11,17317,3567,2439,665,11885,768,17317,13253,10253,6155,1673,288,409,1208,17536,99568,26584,13,27058,75871,265,10253,74772,2436,409,3846,1744,72634,76190,1339,514,82660,3527,409,59157,13109,11,17317,917,1466,2439,11,1370,86633,8811,90966,17317,11,3869,842,437,805,951,436,9769,645,12288,83391,6033,52047,2249,13,47643,2005,409,1208,296,12339,1370,3716,635,11,3930,42775,36077,264,1799,52235,11,3930,25646,21430,22041,396,11,3930,1652,318,56771,13,34447,27750,436,9769,645,56311,1370,86633,409,43406,9517,1076,38647,1880,23761,8336,409,5945,544,35206,13,2009,9427,593,3674,11,7930,50590,5019,34501,55133,294,6,395,7889,6316,13550,978,71,2711,13,2009,9427,593,3674,11,7930,50590,5019,34501,55133,294,6,395,7889,6316,13550,978,71,2711,13,3206,36252,1291,409,8841,77828,76305,69068,7010,3625,32118,8747,811,1370,39015,757,29557,294,6,1885,38315,6316,1156,48099,3869,20662,5945,544,35206,3148,8047,11,3869,31632,409,1208,88265,4864,30714,409,75831,653,9427,593,13,81501,26633,8261,11,503,34155,10045,978,3869,951,6978,8952,285,5512,665,2532,294,6,723,858,38469,653,58551,333,409,35030,7246,3869,2145,8047,76680,20432,332,2428,13,47643,2005,63484,35456,67781,665,26633,27138,14707,12742,82,13,1252,21134,27138,409,81939,409,9427,593,1880,653,2132,27138,294,98279,782,2749,367,1156,10610,2428,11,8065,45369,3930,43014,3625,13324,14848,1208,67239,978,409,5891,49530,404,28130,9427,593,3663,8065,66167,3930,57951,65735,45889,14236,14707,51625,285,60537,978,8135,82,8065,51655,9427,64591,13,34447,503,34155,100198,9466,978,1744,272,17771,8065,45369,294,22827,8348,13532,25253,27138,1744,274,6,81987,1130,665,20272,16968,326,55624,14081,49530,409,20662,35030,7246,13,3341,2761,65220,514,9427,593,9517,301,11,514,9427,593,3674,11,66090,409,1208,17536,99568,26584,11,308,26248,2442,57375,39381,409,5899,404,949,13031,65220,514,9427,593,11,514,2145,425,513,3127,12339,665,5589,3930,5363,409,326,49455,265,13,24703,8348,13532,25253,27138,1826,39587,66090,7930,9517,85,51453,3869,326,39982,978,416,2985,12339,1744,326,39982,978,416,2985,12339,1826,653,9427,593,13,24703,8348,13532,25253,27138,1826,39587,66090,7930,9517,85,51453,3869,326,39982,978,416,2985,12339,1744,326,39982,978,416,2985,12339,1826,653,9427,593,13,33150,4545,39723,326,6,87713,16177,4538,9427,593,11,6316,3488,513,17477,44093,13,1611,75249,513,19266,4581,275,57375,949,11583,270,4558,325,6824,68,3869,2109,52424,3846,1744,20662,95234,3930,9427,593,86100,1375,11967,1765,514,3197,8841,2428,13,9648,55755,22011,11,4864,52571,3869,60946,265,4068,514,41091,11,87451,934,54386,513,86345,11,25692,11,3869,1208,16578,409,20662,88411,653,28800,7591,81,412,5048,11,38831,15170,6316,3738,68,12881,3748,978,13,9648,55755,22011,11,4864,52571,3869,60946,265,4068,514,41091,11,87451,934,54386,513,86345,11,25692,11,3869,1208,16578,409,20662,88411,653,28800,7591,81,412,5048,11,38831,15170,6316,3738,68,12881,3748,978,13,2998,5589,11,17317,3567,2439,51913,2058,653,436,4575,414,5979,653,28800,51794,13,2009,9427,593,665,25400,98375,308,17771,6502,76680,20432,332,2428,13,356,17771,514,54409,7986,409,7591,7044,447,425,1880,1208,76407,15890,3900,35737,1046,361,58268,11,44829,5906,8065,42775,7010,653,60697,409,779,1354,7930,5019,969,274,49152,52424,76680,20432,332,2428,13,12095,9189,308,6,90276,6502,24068,321,11,2893,258,32118,2221,6502,758,25145,72,758,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,791,1495,8111,311,387,264,36815,315,264,15864,477,8982,922,279,7434,315,330,7044,593,1,320,11508,8,304,31018,323,1202,12976,311,3674,13073,323,9764,13,578,19114,11,264,14830,54595,11,27741,72474,1990,279,4623,315,12512,264,7056,311,10737,311,59529,17078,323,279,1648,1274,3118,5694,304,18254,2324,627,198,791,1495,34945,279,990,315,328,25100,1263,72634,323,813,7434,315,279,330,652,16379,315,8903,1359,1405,7931,4048,311,11142,3738,13073,477,32525,311,5052,304,449,8396,13,4452,11,420,649,3063,311,16024,315,8657,2328,323,279,1205,311,4148,1521,27227,311,16805,832,596,837,659,627,198,791,19114,13551,872,3217,3318,449,6978,304,459,27471,6514,4219,1701,264,7056,28846,5820,439,264,37471,5507,13,578,1920,18065,6968,264,7056,323,1243,80163,287,264,6237,1418,12512,433,11,902,6276,13324,311,13488,2204,13878,315,5694,323,3237,21958,21676,627,198,791,1925,1486,315,279,15864,5084,311,387,430,279,1180,315,18054,832,596,7056,374,539,1120,922,31720,832,596,837,659,11,719,1101,922,61708,279,27227,584,10051,304,18254,2324,323,279,3674,40850,430,6211,1057,40521,13,578,19114,13533,430,420,1920,649,3063,311,264,7191,5647,315,31139,323,11542,369,7931,627,198,791,1495,1101,5764,1063,70946,439,3422,323,87068,4860,11,1778,439,330,22
