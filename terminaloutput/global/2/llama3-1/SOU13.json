They start by noting that large animals tend to thrive in hot climates, citing examples such as polar bears being larger than their Malaysian counterparts.\n\nThe speaker introduces the \"Bergman rule,\" which states that large animals are better adapted to cold climates because they have a greater ability to retain heat. This means that small animals may be more susceptible to hyperthermia (heat stroke) in warm temperatures.\n\nThe discussion then turns to the importance of size in relation to climate change. The speaker notes that many species are responding to climate change by changing their geographic range or behavior, such as the marmot having its young earlier or snakes hunting at night for food.\n\nHowever, the speaker also highlights the limitations of these adaptations, citing examples where animals may be unable to move to a new location or adjust their behavior. In such cases, changes in body size may be necessary to adapt to changing environmental conditions.\n\nThe transcript concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding the relationships between climate, size, and energy balance for biodiversity. The speaker notes that changes in body size can have significant impacts on an organism's survival and even its position in the food chain.\n\nOverall, this is a thought-provoking discussion that highlights the complex interplay between climate, size, and adaptation in animals.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,1252,9880,11,389,264,84228,64591,1744,39015,39723,3900,20272,70412,11,653,10065,39015,1481,300,1826,71151,40970,25500,13,9424,688,46206,3625,297,1082,12249,6033,35597,46206,3625,36041,333,31539,13,393,1466,2439,1370,51173,653,11604,1499,12267,13,47643,2005,63484,1826,5636,25500,1744,4538,36271,665,8560,2852,648,13,64105,64,272,17771,653,51173,11741,23034,11,10071,39043,15572,68,28463,49733,11,665,56747,12279,6809,11,3869,12366,11,39723,3900,20272,653,28800,9165,4558,451,13,7695,35737,40970,25500,1744,4538,259,546,263,8065,83259,409,1208,17360,4558,451,13,24703,308,17771,6502,6316,3190,24812,409,27389,7611,45973,3625,924,5192,4804,11,272,17771,1208,83229,3491,409,31782,1543,13,2998,6160,540,978,3257,648,11,3900,22011,1744,3625,94527,22641,306,64972,1208,523,61047,1744,3625,86696,13,4418,66,274,35329,20272,70412,1744,9964,1560,21965,25500,11,9964,10025,14295,6316,17508,700,74696,13,622,41901,16796,20272,326,6,4683,65679,11,9165,729,11,6502,5636,62197,934,39982,1291,13,11583,259,13559,409,53050,2098,1607,275,5636,83457,1744,1208,30203,295,20712,13,4418,66,951,4046,19926,30945,8467,13,445,6496,4864,9189,1370,273,409,64441,11,10071,3900,29253,28463,951,2144,38647,6160,1640,8467,13,46706,514,30281,11,42676,326,6,2530,3460,11,3900,20272,653,282,1607,19266,85,12339,13,7695,308,59858,264,5636,55455,3869,296,4091,11,39587,9964,757,1759,665,305,1553,13,34447,4502,9964,1560,5636,6800,11,9964,439,5636,409,31807,13583,13,5250,332,85815,1744,39015,9964,1765,2749,11,8941,34922,1826,6316,712,25108,668,409,78548,13,1611,326,31769,447,11067,5553,3625,281,9769,645,11,4502,503,34155,14707,13550,285,11,272,17771,514,11323,266,7930,6155,57332,13,19421,274,35329,20272,282,1607,11,9964,6800,285,13,34447,87320,949,23126,729,11,272,17771,1377,57332,11,4864,9189,1370,273,409,39043,75804,88253,13,14465,91507,9189,89504,409,11323,266,11,10071,76776,409,2798,14081,1598,13,41621,3665,89,25692,85815,1744,514,11323,266,2349,1880,1744,3625,27138,15132,294,1759,13,9605,20272,1208,56594,1986,13109,3663,8065,2609,1133,11323,266,2428,949,61651,14707,11,39043,7591,3825,951,16948,4558,1634,11,1370,86633,272,17771,13859,266,2428,13,39783,3488,5019,23589,265,11,4068,46524,3930,282,1607,949,4418,66,11,30870,713,2439,5553,514,31837,13,2009,48734,11,39043,35737,40970,70412,39015,1481,300,13,19421,272,17771,1208,55133,951,9517,23475,11,62439,409,2035,13,5034,56594,1986,13109,75871,665,2349,519,7010,326,77025,1330,13,34447,4068,4864,66517,4502,4864,841,94297,6502,30870,1414,949,29749,308,6,300,934,81991,7591,64184,9637,84411,536,294,6,9035,13109,13,5034,296,2227,51111,11,1370,51173,11,20272,15907,60404,5636,259,35657,13,2009,92942,523,13559,5636,62197,7010,1208,85434,5019,523,3376,951,15975,2469,13,19421,272,17771,1208,26633,90272,951,9517,23475,8065,9517,6583,1386,1133,13,5034,56594,1986,13109,75871,665,2349,519,7010,514,27138,13,14465,5320,2249,14707,11,22011,514,85059,2427,6809,11,10071,3900,379,264,653,490,1791,7930,757,342,5615,818,13,11583,84411,536,294,6,9035,13109,1826,29059,8047,7010,11083,342,4558,4978,13,2998,5636,11,7643,47276,11,1647,39646,1826,49733,13,64105,64,841,87264,6502,5636,4382,4502,503,31769,2629,285,70374,5636,46110,13,19421,272,17771,1208,8348,13532,25253,951,9517,23475,8065,2609,1133,11323,266,2428,13,5034,56594,1986,13109,75871,7010,3625,20934,598,4046,39624,10515,8467,13,19421,272,17771,3846,1765,75249,2700,306,11083,58673,2249,409,38317,13,1952,829,275,74699,1744,514,11323,266,1880,1208,62827,15132,409,296,4558,1557,13,34447,4502,514,11323,266,2349,7010,514,27138,11,3625,4039,12249,82133,12,8839,62439,409,62827,5019,3154,519,949,27058,514,47929,11,4864,91507,75144,653,51173,13,1952,69152,653,51655,409,46681,38883,11,951,98733,17724,7930,11083,77065,951,297,1082,12249,7010,43905,1208,9822,13,11246,92759,519,11,27750,77617,3946,409,86696,1880,409,94527,13,34447,5019,1208,56594,1986,13109,11,834,1474,6870,11,665,75249,272,17771,3062,949,61651,14707,11,665,27750,27138,409,25626,23851,11323,266,2428,11,1208,62827,11412,62439,26725,3625,20934,598,4046,39624,10515,8467,13,46408,7958,68,1208,7550,648,951,16948,4558,1634,1765,10335,265,13,64105,64,25692,27584,62439,9637,2035,7010,1208,13826,25108,818,38450,12267,13,5034,24408,33537,8047,3869,1208,62827,27750,36852,4918,27138,11,27549,20605,68,13,19421,272,3433,10333,31307,6033,6502,11,1208,62827,11,39043,42463,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,32,27387,36815,4999,198,791,19114,374,25394,279,5133,1990,10182,323,1404,304,10099,13,2435,1212,555,27401,430,3544,10099,8541,311,41972,304,4106,92399,11,33264,10507,1778,439,25685,30824,1694,8294,1109,872,66531,38495,627,198,791,19114,40019,279,330,33,2431,1543,6037,1359,902,5415,430,3544,10099,527,2731,30464,311,9439,92399,1606,814,617,264,7191,5845,311,14389,8798,13,1115,3445,430,2678,10099,1253,387,810,47281,311,17508,700,91299,320,20559,12943,8,304,8369,20472,627,198,791,10430,1243,10800,311,279,12939,315,1404,304,12976,311,10
