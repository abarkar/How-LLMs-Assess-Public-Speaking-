The speaker, who appears to be a researcher, mentions that they spent half of their days making small test samples (petits pâtés) and testing them to determine their properties.\n\nThe three main ingredients mentioned are:\n\n1. Terre crue (raw earth) - which is studied at different scales to determine its components, particularly the argiles (clays)\n2. Chanvre (hemp) - which has fibers that can be used for insulation, and studying the size and water-absorption capacity of these particles allows for the creation of a \"terre allégée\" (lightened earth)\n3. Eau (water) - which is mixed with the terre crue and chanvre to create the insulation material\n\nThe speaker also mentions that they traveled across Brittany and Normandy to collect 30 different types of raw earth, each with its own unique properties, and conducted laboratory tests to determine why some samples worked better than others. They then used this data to choose representative samples from these regions and tested their performance.\n\nSome key points mentioned in the transcript include:\n\n* The insulation material is ideal for building construction\n* It does not produce any waste, stores a lot of carbon, and can be recycled endlessly\n* The speaker's project involves participative research with artisans\n* They are currently working on developing a simple on-site test to determine which materials and quantities should be used to ensure the desired performance.\n\nOverall, the transcript appears to be discussing innovative and sustainable approaches to building insulation and construction.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,9424,1055,10333,45325,11,60404,11,3625,86696,281,64272,5512,3869,1208,86451,949,61651,14707,41091,11,503,41901,16796,20272,1647,42775,13,14465,39904,1208,4647,12583,978,409,11083,503,3514,14014,11,3625,69236,7010,1208,30870,68,11,3869,20028,951,86696,281,64272,5512,13,19421,4864,3625,84921,9952,51625,1854,13,36684,58673,2249,409,38317,13263,3869,57705,978,6091,261,653,13399,519,30945,2428,887,63497,5019,514,293,64272,3904,13,7695,42182,23761,514,5636,91329,1640,2428,1880,514,5636,2804,519,3284,13,1952,25692,514,9765,462,16339,1685,593,961,412,1765,10335,265,11,9952,71686,56321,81336,15433,4167,11,1744,326,54386,46524,64,44093,1353,54960,13,7695,841,54206,85624,7591,40213,11,3900,5708,68,48488,409,1841,20337,11,1880,665,5636,11,389,25692,514,1421,10993,3869,326,52152,5589,72,13,356,17771,3709,3433,481,758,27058,47929,3846,1744,272,17771,11,28068,2439,3869,1208,3488,5019,653,7643,53510,13,7777,11,21134,81336,15433,1188,13,7054,758,3489,301,5634,28154,2933,409,8246,44260,496,1604,11,57485,3869,1208,37291,7010,1208,8309,52009,409,921,483,1880,7010,514,523,69628,2933,409,650,92512,14081,569,11,1826,264,4972,72,4382,11,10071,25945,6485,68,11,1841,25945,3977,949,507,2005,11,1208,88026,1589,361,13,46706,11083,58673,2249,11,4864,326,57286,664,648,3869,96642,4046,331,37907,5019,665,7591,23827,261,15907,40321,1821,11,81186,3625,1417,3742,13,3459,37854,14480,7138,66601,13,7777,11,26633,90272,81336,15433,1188,13,7054,758,3489,6853,628,5048,11,15890,3625,16178,417,14848,55505,3869,1208,59251,951,23125,1154,951,5636,94527,293,349,12249,11,264,653,36271,7930,513,282,3972,5986,978,43310,949,507,2005,11,97507,11,514,27114,49606,13,362,326,55624,57663,409,1208,259,7404,11,389,71451,409,98385,2598,2482,594,28111,519,8065,66304,11,25945,73083,31539,11,1841,7245,1572,409,4247,437,13109,13,356,17771,84568,7930,1469,90332,546,514,68226,13399,519,13,2009,490,1791,11,272,17771,934,35329,379,264,8065,40970,3154,519,409,27114,49606,1744,409,35641,13,1708,1105,11,5019,3625,44178,63934,1291,11,503,57286,664,648,1208,62827,951,2598,2482,1880,28130,23878,13109,3869,15938,655,409,326,93847,13,44031,5317,978,3869,29449,8348,13532,25253,81336,15433,1188,11,326,93847,11,17317,64290,2439,3846,934,54386,917,6853,6316,88026,682,19395,8047,13,43987,26178,11,4068,14240,664,1291,3625,24601,409,20662,88026,682,19395,8047,15878,20028,951,2606,81560,409,32118,5317,288,11,10071,665,864,52985,665,42463,20662,9765,1130,817,21797,13109,949,61651,14707,11,41091,7930,86807,100196,11,503,34155,20272,653,68082,13,622,34155,52579,11083,11176,288,1880,7643,281,6853,11,1880,4864,36731,79988,3869,30517,43905,1208,72777,24812,1880,1208,20935,438,648,11,2536,6502,5019,3625,9517,41546,321,1291,11,10071,5019,9517,2119,466,220,966,2024,417,1744,503,34155,87885,2353,14014,8065,2092,11,65735,653,1760,511,1286,51625,285,5019,665,7591,23827,261,28130,52962,1133,11,665,34501,409,28130,259,1994,324,665,384,2933,13,14465,757,38831,83384,35597,9952,951,86696,281,64272,5512,13,34447,1208,44178,16271,9952,41091,11,16968,46110,11,272,17771,1744,503,34155,20272,951,4043,2852,665,9511,67763,5019,15522,3212,4839,1133,87320,1647,46110,281,64272,978,259,1188,6033,6502,13,41757,412,978,10253,46681,951,2027,38647,409,27114,49606,11,503,34155,45575,409,75249,90194,951,2024,417,1880,951,27114,85,417,10253,52962,3808,25945,85114,13,19421,39015,11,69428,758,14465,757,38831,83384,9952,220,20,2024,417,91678,5983,409,16968,326,88766,3121,1880,220,18,27114,85,417,91678,5983,409,43905,1208,9822,13,62293,11083,2024,417,1880,11083,27114,85,417,73661,552,11,4864,59157,1082,951,32118,5317,288,11,44829,503,57286,664,648,43153,24601,13,39783,5899,361,32118,4919,2428,89646,11,653,68226,13399,519,8065,1948,11,1880,6316,23878,13109,3869,342,52424,326,6,28400,307,13109,4046,4791,5392,5048,13,27058,1089,7889,326,6,18168,409,11083,58673,2249,11,1647,46494,274,6,27153,361,7010,514,60697,409,88817,8696,5293,5983,13,7695,18916,332,81186,951,100130,13,1708,1105,5019,1913,404,11,10362,1082,1765,514,88026,2933,11,4864,42775,273,1180,77776,3869,52895,716,653,4382,1296,409,44453,1291,7930,29557,2221,409,7591,23827,261,934,2053,86374,4298,2249,1880,665,74940,10484,13109,23761,42587,5512,5019,40192,404,27750,24601,13,5034,88026,1589,361,1880,3625,16178,417,348,19395,978,2629,645,15132,951,86374,4298,2249,42587,5512,41199,1208,85434,951,27138,13,34447,3625,14240,664,1291,17317,68061,625,306,6316,14896,13,5034,21797,13109,1826,653,54829,704,321,5019,19477,52750,326,6,5389,404,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5084,1093,499,617,264,36815,315,264,15864,477,7274,1405,279,19114,374,25394,872,3495,389,6968,459,10728,29487,49117,3769,1701,2254,11,42688,22658,14293,323,7384,13,578,19114,11,889,8111,311,387,264,32185,11,34945,430,814,7543,4376,315,872,2919,3339,2678,1296,10688,320,7005,1220,281,64272,5512,8,323,7649,1124,311,8417,872,6012,627,198,791,2380,1925,14293,9932,527,512,198,16,13,10335,265,158
