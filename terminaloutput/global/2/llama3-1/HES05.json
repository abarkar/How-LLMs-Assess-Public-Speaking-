The text is written in French, but I'll provide an English translation:\n\n\"I affirm that we are all capable of predicting the future. What? You don't believe me? I'll demonstrate it to you. If I take my phone like this and open my hand, what will happen? Not knowing how to fly, my phone will fall to the ground and maybe break. You see, everyone is able to predict the consequences of an action that has not yet occurred. This is called projection, and we use this ability every day, especially when making decisions.\n\nFor example, if I want to call my thesis advisor, I'll definitely do it every day. To do so, I need to take my phone, unlock it, go into the contact list, find his number in the directory, and then make the call. And for each step, I'm performing a projection. What we just did, finding a projection or a sequence of actions to achieve an objective, is called planning, and it's the main theme of my thesis.\n\nHistorically, planning has been one of the fundamental domains of artificial intelligence. It allowed us to create robots like this one [points to Opportunity, the Mars rover]. For those who don't know, here's Opportunity. This autonomous robot was landed on Mars in 2004 and was disconnected a few weeks ago after 15 years of good and loyal service, and 15 years of planning.\n\nHowever, for its planning to work, it needs to be situated in a completely determined environment where there are no other actions than its own. In other words, if it had crossed a Martian, that would have been complicated. My thesis work is to go further, that is, to work in a dynamic and unknown environment.\n\nTo do so, I'm using a supercomputer that you all know - the human brain. And particularly, three mechanisms. The human brain is a communication system that's very important. The first one is the power of habit. When I unlock my phone screen, I perform a complex set of movements that I do more or less autonomously because I've done them so many times that I've learned to do them automatically.\n\nThe second one is energy-efficient thinking. I could have found a better plan to call my thesis advisor, for example, by putting his number on speed dial or remembering it, but like many people, I take the most satisfying solution.\n\nThe third one is dynamic planning. The world is constantly evolving and changing without cease. Ah, just now, my thesis advisor is reminding me. I'll stop my planning and stop there. Thank you.\"","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,622,82405,404,2727,1744,17317,74533,26725,2107,4893,409,550,15433,556,326,6,5389,404,13,3489,6870,949,41621,841,757,272,3433,10333,6502,949,14465,91507,9189,514,7591,1677,95920,13,12095,4864,35456,82,1647,100007,11,22299,272,76832,11,1880,1744,503,6,283,49606,1208,1925,11,1744,11412,2442,57375,513,45347,949,4275,98676,519,6502,4499,261,11,1647,100007,11412,10390,655,1370,88026,1880,25692,85815,513,272,34858,13,41621,23933,10333,11,9189,62299,26725,2107,4893,409,27389,35573,3625,1615,978,45045,294,31109,1957,7930,841,274,17771,6502,35597,86595,8047,13,356,17771,3846,934,54386,917,6853,1208,22343,13,19421,17317,4186,19941,20662,23878,13109,26725,3625,49301,11,665,54008,1291,5019,59394,951,35881,6948,13,4366,51173,11,4502,4864,5320,2249,917,8023,1647,2167,12844,409,270,4558,325,11,1744,503,53149,6853,14707,4046,1325,336,479,26725,3625,49301,11,1744,51441,12,3841,20028,949,7695,47090,1744,4864,864,77,818,1647,100007,11,1744,4864,514,7591,424,583,4618,11,1744,503,6,52009,7010,514,9517,79,62704,11,1744,4864,52571,4538,99077,7010,1208,34024,11,5019,665,5589,326,53149,8023,13,19421,5019,46777,14240,2070,11,503,6,27153,361,6316,22343,13,24703,1744,17317,11457,2439,409,20028,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,409,46524,6316,22343,11,6316,16578,294,6,4109,5019,93381,71933,653,1665,333,11,274,53149,6853,1208,3197,2461,11,1880,1826,514,270,25253,12717,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,22425,81235,11,1208,3197,2461,1826,653,951,8106,288,28405,1045,1759,409,326,55624,8677,1989,1104,72,6853,13,46408,264,14175,285,409,75831,951,29807,22299,66090,63484,13,27058,66056,7930,841,514,74282,79738,6502,11,4160,3457,48379,13,24703,12585,3154,263,638,11,7591,981,978,1765,21725,665,220,1049,19,11,264,24560,7591,6595,978,3900,379,264,45889,5347,33903,11,42138,220,868,65838,409,82134,1880,781,7911,2249,3600,11,1880,220,868,65838,409,3197,2461,13,356,13059,519,11,5019,1744,829,3197,2461,34501,818,11,3900,47090,934,35329,513,2503,361,7010,653,50026,40280,4684,4558,79507,7591,23827,978,11,1880,39723,3900,308,59858,264,6502,294,81979,6299,1744,3625,4502,15564,13,9648,519,13510,1744,274,35329,50590,14425,69068,653,49295,3675,11,45602,44521,1339,24560,4684,76366,13,3206,42775,409,270,4558,325,1826,294,6,14283,5636,78060,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,409,58673,15610,7010,653,50026,40280,18003,2428,1880,304,5259,84,13,27058,45602,11,503,49963,1082,653,2307,12,8904,324,1744,9189,4635,2852,53070,26725,11,514,272,5976,2933,2854,467,13,19421,665,54008,1291,11,56321,32118,4919,2191,288,13,2009,272,5976,2933,2854,467,1826,653,72601,409,10758,11,7930,1826,653,72601,409,10758,7930,1826,25945,3062,13,2009,21134,11,272,17771,1208,5457,409,326,6,10796,3993,13,445,1105,593,4864,7591,424,583,4618,1647,4046,73085,409,100007,11,503,6,27153,361,665,20272,653,40126,409,54409,12760,69125,11,1744,4864,66517,409,85722,5636,6033,40970,3154,263,638,11,66021,1744,4864,3625,16796,2267,1220,19227,1001,409,37291,1744,4864,3625,16796,917,6091,13,2009,26633,90272,11,272,17771,326,31769,45317,648,294,31769,64374,17108,31037,13,622,6,4202,2852,18757,46524,653,49348,3197,5019,917,8023,1647,2167,12844,409,270,4558,325,11,1370,51173,11,665,2322,61512,4538,99077,665,4799,72,11,6033,14707,665,312,45019,4538,99077,11,10071,11,22299,48488,409,47104,11,4864,35456,82,1208,6425,1208,5636,8795,2852,5048,13,2009,8348,13532,25253,11,272,17771,1208,3197,2461,18003,2428,13,2009,38900,1826,665,738,5048,51913,3294,11,1880,4046,12821,361,15878,272,24201,13,16770,9165,729,11,1120,1133,11,1647,2167,12844,409,270,4558,325,757,61158,6853,13,14465,91507,2961,5615,466,7643,3197,2461,1880,296,6,1138,5615,466,39015,13,25145,72,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2028,8111,311,387,264,36815,315,264,3137,477,15864,555,279,3229,389,279,8712,315,9293,323,20212,304,12966,13,578,1495,374,5439,304,8753,11,719,358,3358,3493,459,6498,14807,1473,7189,33449,430,584,527,682,13171,315,52997,279,3938,13,3639,30,1472,1541,956,4510,757,30,358,3358,20461,433,311,499,13,1442,358,1935,856,4641,1093,420,323,1825,856,1450,11,1148,690,3621,30,2876,14392,1268,311,11722,11,856,4641,690,4498,311,279,5015,323,7344,1464,13,1472,1518,11,5127,374,3025,311,7168,279,16296,315,459,1957,430,706,539,3686,10222,13,1115,374,2663,22343,11,323,584,1005,420,5845,1475,1938,11,5423,994,3339,11429,627,198,2520,3187,11,422,358,1390,311,1650,856,17850,37713,11,358,3358,8659,656,433,1475,1938,13,2057,656,779,11,358,1205,311,1935,856,4641,11,15405,433,11,733,1139,279,3729,1160,11,1505,813,1396,304,279,6352,11,323,1243,1304,279,1650,13,1628,369,1855,3094,11,358,2846,16785,264,22343,13,3639,584,1120,1550,11,9455,264,22343,477,264,8668,315,6299,311,11322,459,16945,11,374,2663,9293,11,323,433,596,279,1925,7057,315,856,17850,627,198,50083,2740,11,9293,706,1027,832,315,279,16188,31576,315,21075,11478,13,1102,5535,603,311,1893,29807,1093,420,832,510,7862,311,48379,11,279,21725,62352,948,1789,1884,889,1541,956,1440,11,1618,596,48379,13,1115,39293,12585,57
