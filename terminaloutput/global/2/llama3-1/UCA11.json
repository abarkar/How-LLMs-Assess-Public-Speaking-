{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-11-19T12:22:53.805064074Z","response":"This appears to be a transcript of a speech or presentation about the concept of \"infraction-obstacle\" (also known as \"crime prevention\" or \"anticipatory justice\"). The speaker is discussing the idea of using predictive analytics and data collection to prevent crimes from occurring in the first place, rather than simply punishing those who have already committed them.\n\nThe transcript begins by asking the audience to imagine a future society where there is no violence, crime, or terrorism. This society would use \"anticipatory justice\" to prevent these issues from arising in the first place, by identifying individuals who are at risk of committing crimes and intervening early on.\n\nThe speaker notes that this idea may seem futuristic, but it is actually being implemented today through various means, such as predictive policing and data-driven crime prevention. The goal is to use data and analytics to identify patterns and trends that can help prevent crimes from occurring in the first place.\n\nHowever, the speaker also notes that there are concerns about the potential consequences of this approach, including the erosion of civil liberties and the risk of over-criminalization. Therefore, it is important to balance the need for crime prevention with the need to protect individual freedoms.\n\nThe rest of the transcript delves deeper into the concept of \"infraction-obstacle\" and its implications for society, including a discussion of the potential benefits and drawbacks of this approach.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,362,19610,45325,46939,69379,84,89504,409,326,6,13885,16597,93549,44698,949,11842,949,13789,11,45575,1081,268,3209,2439,1370,6316,38920,88411,409,23423,8047,13,38891,89,6316,77824,3938,11,10071,6502,21965,781,396,8511,11,7010,1208,88265,3900,308,59858,44521,1339,5636,409,9349,11,5636,409,7591,3817,447,685,11,5636,409,24020,68,13,39783,77824,39587,7010,1208,88265,17317,308,6,4202,2439,5636,3869,1207,404,951,4046,5287,958,1083,4893,409,955,220,1954,4520,77807,37093,74687,514,9977,308,58736,1601,1339,5636,13,12535,949,2895,66096,3869,1208,82291,11,7930,29557,30532,294,6,1138,5615,466,653,23496,84,409,85722,16961,8047,11,87451,37953,934,54386,264,9517,16080,3869,4538,665,31400,8657,285,64656,294,6,29982,1392,7930,29557,73468,294,31769,74199,404,934,35329,29253,653,10025,593,36875,13327,409,59157,8082,294,31109,4225,16597,13,445,6,13885,16597,308,26248,27584,6502,3869,23761,7591,23827,8047,1236,6,93772,294,31109,4046,688,940,13109,29557,294,6,77196,72684,6316,45361,281,10610,1604,27389,688,535,13,1708,1105,4864,63762,3846,1744,9189,9189,294,3695,13,62408,13356,18111,324,17194,1826,12266,75804,88253,5253,83,5019,61512,11,9189,514,3665,89,11,17317,18434,2439,7010,653,38900,7930,348,1082,3869,326,6,360,2221,10039,40241,13,19421,514,64079,281,10610,278,7010,29449,77824,11,7930,7591,5098,483,3846,7930,1826,12553,635,6033,3900,416,635,11,8541,25400,28463,5553,3846,63669,294,6,8322,49686,13,19421,3900,97487,1744,3846,45441,55162,10036,1370,6316,25626,48901,951,55467,5168,788,665,294,2182,89,949,1183,12416,14707,13,29124,83,664,919,40126,3625,9517,4109,3435,8467,1880,32118,8747,266,8467,7930,4046,1195,16149,3869,1208,16578,294,22827,52309,266,13,5034,55133,3488,7930,513,17477,1826,27058,62998,42067,23496,84,11,4635,84,951,3600,409,4379,11,5019,951,86696,326,8362,1354,6033,5019,274,93825,18336,69068,11,43989,57375,44093,665,22848,978,949,1952,3567,72,408,14687,39587,8818,17194,33670,27584,294,49152,13603,945,72,732,17771,665,16968,4865,6316,23423,8047,961,351,8047,1370,653,6800,13026,409,3613,275,2303,729,1880,409,12155,4294,4893,3435,8467,11,7930,4263,306,1880,4046,14717,69625,3625,781,285,13,19421,272,17771,3846,7930,1120,57609,326,31769,1195,29355,1880,514,82620,11,41199,514,83259,3930,30388,68,97739,9326,11,409,42067,704,321,16422,307,2428,9721,519,934,17771,326,6,13885,16597,93549,44698,13,2009,64079,281,10610,278,841,513,71080,5636,45575,70374,3869,45361,1215,11,10071,44767,3869,21945,466,3625,82134,52962,3808,3869,46932,265,8231,39904,7364,3869,7364,294,31109,34501,65461,60224,3869,6316,34501,20862,64829,13,356,13059,519,11,653,38847,1826,3869,70375,5019,1370,3716,556,514,82620,409,3846,32118,4919,44618,13,5034,5790,263,5979,367,409,12155,97222,21901,2908,12249,8065,9859,409,1208,11347,265,36959,68,77463,88661,361,5253,83,379,74533,5392,788,9517,301,1001,550,5615,2641,949,356,17771,49733,1744,11083,58673,2249,864,7521,306,2035,13,445,41901,3841,84,1826,294,31769,74199,404,6316,76680,30303,46680,46140,90053,409,326,6,13885,16597,93549,44698,11,1208,7591,5589,404,11,4046,2470,52424,26077,645,49276,5247,14848,7010,3846,60697,11,14240,664,1291,28130,3851,95234,1880,665,7591,23827,261,43153,57705,978,2889,8467,13,1611,39015,11,4864,5019,41098,4046,6414,3913,62321,1880,12108,26077,645,15132,3625,4017,288,73083,3916,7930,841,56311,1880,76776,841,97569,23761,704,265,6519,14014,7010,326,6,19010,4422,367,409,3846,955,294,6,13885,16597,74687,15878,9517,12287,290,1765,3846,70927,11,7010,326,6,5389,404,11,326,6,13885,16597,93549,44698,92215,23761,16898,30885,8047,9952,6316,79036,409,6667,68,665,58617,409,12155,46681,1880,409,12155,17320,17274,645,665,48234,294,31769,74199,404,5019,95917,359,294,6,40997,17317,85114,2848,8839,3869,10025,593,13,41621,326,26248,554,89,13550,285,11,11083,58673,2249,274,6,1354,5192,81541,39587,7010,6316,8335,738,5048,9465,9517,4099,1880,22848,978,13,5034,22848,978,11,5019,93224,554,11,14240,519,1208,67239,978,5019,95917,359,294,6,40997,17317,409,5293,261,3869,326,6,19010,4422,367,951,47371,4144,82,951,6155,1673,288,7930,274,6,77196,72684,546,1880,274,98279,20672,546,3869,17317,7010,326,6,5389,404,3587,68,9189,312,1195,25134,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2028,8111,311,387,264,36815,315,264,8982,477,15864,922,279,7434,315,330,13885,16597,93549,44698,1,320,19171,3967,439,330,85454,27344,1,477,330,8322,575,5382,12437,1865,578,19114,374,25394,279,4623,315,1701,60336,28975,323,828,4526,311,5471,17073,505,31965,304,279,1176,2035,11,4856,1109,5042,75986,1884,889,617,2736,11411,1124,627,198,791,36815,12302,555,10371,279,10877,311,13085,264,3938,8396,1405,1070,374,912,9349,11,9977,11,477,24020,13,1115,8396,1053,1005,330,8322,575,5382,12437,1,311,5471,1521,4819,505,40986,304,279,1176,2035,11,555,25607,7931,889,527,520,5326,315,40583,17073,323,89501,4216,389,627,198,791,19114,8554,430,420,4623,1253,2873,80320,11,719,433,374,3604,1694,11798,3432,1555,5370,3445,11,1778,439,60336,55671,323,828,32505,
