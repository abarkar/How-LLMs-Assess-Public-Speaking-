They note that this may be the last generation that learns to drive, as cars will soon be able to learn and adapt without human intervention.\n\nThe speaker then shifts focus to the importance of cybersecurity in the age of connected devices. They explain that a car is not just a physical object but also an electronic one with multiple components and sensors that can be hacked or attacked by viruses. This raises concerns about the potential impact on people's safety and their environment if a self-driving car is compromised.\n\nThe speaker then introduces their thesis, which aims to develop algorithms and mathematical models to create artificial intelligence that simulates the immune system of an autonomous vehicle. The goal is to enable cars to learn and adapt to new threats, just like our own immune systems do.\n\nThey explain that there are two types of immunity: innate, which reacts quickly but is limited in its ability to respond to new attacks; and adaptive, which can learn from experience and improve over time. The speaker's AI system will be based on the adaptive type, as it needs to detect and respond to new threats.\n\nThe AI system will monitor all communications between a car's components to identify normal behavior and detect anomalies or deviations from that norm. If an anomaly is detected, the AI system will trigger security measures to prevent unauthorized access or malicious activity.\n\nThe speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of artificial intelligence in protecting autonomous vehicles from cyber threats. They express gratitude for the opportunity to work on this project and its potential to keep people safe on the road.\n\nOverall, the transcript highlights the need for innovative approaches to cybersecurity in the age of connected devices and autonomous vehicles.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,3206,281,12339,1826,32118,4919,3457,268,13,356,8458,296,26248,44093,15550,258,978,409,514,46131,665,26633,6033,56321,1437,4042,645,1323,7211,265,665,15572,68,3625,45165,83613,2482,13,362,9832,77492,88253,11,6316,48901,409,4538,47929,1826,5113,3689,8047,13,11876,4160,42204,274,49455,31559,8372,5118,306,13,1952,274,6,391,652,37093,27584,3869,3625,98054,4684,4558,79507,95103,288,13,69327,1208,86806,7754,1744,17317,44521,2439,3869,28130,71751,11,272,17771,29449,9284,13,7695,513,25692,934,54386,45441,1208,88818,46680,2214,39723,326,54386,274,1815,76069,556,13,2998,5589,11,5019,76076,11,3625,36852,4918,3869,2278,978,1126,653,14175,285,13,7695,47090,47929,934,31109,81645,11,272,17771,653,31260,4667,978,11,22299,29449,100007,13,4418,66,11,3900,25692,23761,272,1260,294,6,1617,20234,6033,409,17188,13,19421,4502,11,7010,29449,2317,68,409,9693,1941,978,2407,13109,75804,88253,11,3625,2909,1441,4667,5512,11,389,3625,60172,1765,17317,11,2486,467,11,272,17771,17317,7930,682,2439,23761,2700,5512,1370,27750,2909,1441,13,19421,3625,1651,64,14295,56311,17317,11148,556,1880,11148,556,3869,29449,1218,61140,13,14465,9189,436,395,554,11,272,17771,39015,39723,86953,1188,7643,270,4558,325,13,12535,20028,917,9484,265,3869,6316,81645,949,12535,274,6,3989,1773,121597,408,265,949,39783,81645,2278,4558,451,51854,2909,1441,13,31137,3357,324,11,4046,70329,2428,1880,28463,951,2107,668,1759,7930,82133,25400,29557,10367,409,9302,12329,11,8678,805,1880,59394,951,35881,6948,13,6178,72,11,1647,42775,6824,68,3869,48021,665,2035,951,12384,288,1880,951,1491,85798,7033,978,8637,8467,5019,19477,52750,6316,11478,1989,1104,72,6853,7930,11412,1675,8646,514,72601,4998,3928,12267,294,31109,81645,3154,263,638,13,1219,2727,29449,72601,4998,3928,12267,11,4538,436,57332,1826,409,20028,665,80444,1744,12155,2909,1441,841,513,7591,583,75,306,6502,13,19421,409,47371,408,265,4538,2942,44618,45973,43905,76220,294,52152,376,7713,8811,588,484,5048,13,46706,3625,42345,66474,4998,3928,17724,11,389,264,26633,4595,13,39783,294,635,6301,8047,11,7930,9517,74972,100198,11,10071,58271,409,20028,3663,3869,951,945,22550,1759,87325,13,19421,6316,294,635,19830,1082,6033,10737,1413,11,1841,27549,1826,13171,294,53149,9484,265,3869,74282,66014,64972,4538,61624,22530,13,6178,72,11,1647,11478,1989,1104,72,6853,11,27549,274,6,1354,23772,3930,26633,90272,955,13,3341,1647,528,14081,49530,1826,409,85877,440,261,409,80080,1651,64,14295,1880,409,87325,17188,13,27058,20028,3663,3869,326,6,613,1923,1133,409,12155,2909,1441,13,19421,409,47371,408,265,4538,2942,44618,45973,43905,76220,294,52152,376,7713,8811,588,484,5048,13,19421,409,47371,408,265,4538,2942,44618,45973,43905,76220,294,52152,376,7713,8811,588,484,5048,13,19421,409,47371,408,265,4538,2942,44618,45973,43905,76220,294,52152,376,7713,8811,588,484,5048,13,362,326,6,613,1923,1133,1880,3869,1208,34280,20053,13109,951,41467,13,19421,5019,3846,20028,11,326,55624,8677,1989,1104,72,6853,11,7930,1826,9517,22235,1370,11083,12384,288,11,15765,4618,40744,3625,17320,9465,3625,85114,40321,1821,409,1208,81645,13,27058,4043,1155,294,53149,9484,265,6316,12223,11,653,12541,294,6,37939,46429,11,7930,3608,57609,514,52962,1133,4725,3930,45165,83613,1130,13,19421,4502,3869,653,4545,11,326,57286,266,3930,72601,409,1208,81645,1826,98642,3869,1208,12223,11,39587,43905,35881,1854,7930,11412,23761,85424,1826,63828,13178,547,13,19421,7010,514,4865,32150,556,11,4502,326,57286,266,7591,64519,11,409,1208,12223,11,3900,379,40142,6316,70673,648,13,19421,39015,11,326,55624,8677,1989,1104,72,6853,11412,7591,566,268,9211,951,42345,66474,409,77463,13,27058,8654,5615,9211,43905,76220,294,52152,376,7713,13,5034,2869,38469,264,44093,1469,403,978,67009,1880,77463,3869,326,93825,2854,467,13,435,2852,519,665,80444,1744,326,55624,8677,1989,1104,72,6853,17317,1760,73899,409,1208,293,49530,1082,2854,8511,13,19421,4502,653,9880,11,1647,281,12339,1826,7010,6316,81645,3154,263,638,11,1880,829,2107,1295,11,3900,308,6,4202,1339,6502,3869,6033,63346,514,2107,354,13,25145,72,13,25145,72,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,32,36815,505,264,31678,477,15864,922,279,3938,315,39293,11731,323,62542,627,198,791,19114,12302,555,11821,872,75444,449,872,7126,596,990,439,264,45239,323,1268,9515,617,28995,311,3719,8599,6302,430,649,58681,5694,323,13893,387,7373,39293,304,279,3938,13,2435,5296,430,420,1253,387,279,1566,9659,430,47310,311,6678,11,439,9515,690,5246,387,3025,311,4048,323,10737,2085,3823,21623,627,198,791,19114,1243,29735,5357,311,279,12939,315,62542,304,279,4325,315,8599,7766,13,2435,10552,430,264,1841,374,539,1120,264,7106,1665,719,1101,459,14683,832,449,5361,6956,323,26148,430,649,387,47939,477,18855,555,42068,13,1115,25930,10742,922,279,4754,5536,389,1274,596,7296,323,872,4676,422,264,659,60811,1841,374,44500,627,198,791,19114,1243,40019,872,17850,11,902,22262,311,2274,26249,323,37072,4211,311,1893,21075,11478,430,1675,24031,279,22852,1887,315,459,39293,7458,13,578,
