It appears to be a researcher's reflection on their study about discrimination in the housing market. The researcher, who is an economist, designed an experiment where they sent out thousands of emails with identical content, except for the name at the top (Émilie, Vincent, or Mohamed). The goal was to analyze whether people were more likely to respond to one name over another, and if so, what might be the underlying reasons.\n\nThe researcher found that Mohamed had significantly lower response rates than Émilie and Vincent. This suggests that there may be unconscious biases at play, even among those who consider themselves fair-minded individuals.\n\nThe study also looked at whether providing additional information about the person (e.g., their profession) could reduce these biases. The findings suggest that when Mohamed presented himself as a stable individual with a good job, his response rate improved significantly. This implies that people's perceptions of someone's stability and reliability can influence their willingness to engage in transactions with them.\n\nThe researcher concludes by reflecting on the implications of their study for policy-making. They hope that their findings will help inform policies aimed at reducing discrimination in the housing market.\n\nOverall, this transcript provides a unique glimpse into the world of social science research, highlighting the complexities and nuances involved in studying human behavior and decision-making.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,6433,981,2439,1744,9189,779,9188,89,21744,978,71237,294,22827,74756,1133,1880,1744,9189,46838,62316,89,514,29740,261,13,27058,3846,20028,11,9189,39904,89,6316,38920,46320,1765,7757,11,1370,51173,1765,2009,6098,7307,13,33150,25646,409,45889,49301,11,9189,2215,19610,56321,86658,11,56321,7631,288,25945,92892,17724,7930,841,3722,4558,8135,1744,1370,514,550,98078,951,23496,355,13,29124,73370,648,11,35407,1880,60759,26483,688,26725,3625,56321,15265,74756,1133,3869,28130,733,60768,13,41621,308,6,52659,934,22827,74206,74756,1133,11,3900,9189,47090,39587,90194,9465,27750,56321,23496,355,13,4418,66,4864,9189,17477,1208,3488,11,7930,73661,62316,89,45325,949,29124,73370,648,949,35407,949,60759,949,41621,2665,9667,53070,8065,706,569,949,2998,59157,13109,11,3625,56321,86658,1744,9189,47592,312,3209,355,15132,51527,13,81245,14848,24560,60630,5512,1370,653,52571,324,13,24703,52571,324,55729,648,409,9189,8678,805,1880,409,7591,23827,261,4502,9189,27389,59958,23577,653,3738,955,294,6,485,65023,84,13,19421,3846,52571,324,11,36346,14707,272,17771,41091,13,61651,97507,11,2761,65220,1647,4046,73085,11,9952,653,1515,78493,390,79884,5019,11,653,409,11083,39904,12,67380,4799,285,1826,294,6,3239,42219,951,2606,4918,409,86658,961,412,665,9822,5019,7591,23827,261,4502,20719,81235,3625,86658,1913,285,29124,73370,648,11,35407,6033,60759,14848,951,17393,96642,294,6,677,2002,404,6316,90509,1880,39587,653,1515,1133,13,3206,719,949,41621,326,26248,554,89,25692,85815,13550,285,11,272,17771,294,57286,664,1291,1208,21934,13,19421,5019,61512,11,4864,841,36731,6502,15983,77828,11,4864,841,36731,6502,8841,77828,11,2536,11,41091,4864,36731,82653,17194,13,34447,326,31769,45317,648,11,9189,514,3665,89,25945,14707,11,3846,308,17771,6502,1744,1208,17452,11,1208,60028,11,1208,1589,1082,11,63401,11,16968,39043,11,16968,39043,13,11842,13,445,31769,45317,648,274,55624,978,22550,28463,3869,1208,3488,951,14572,12922,1841,3900,308,17771,6502,31914,580,82653,81235,1744,951,23496,355,779,1188,50419,5512,11,1913,79738,1370,23761,1515,5512,3869,1208,84411,764,35285,409,1208,39973,1880,264,1188,5636,409,5107,5512,3869,513,98054,1765,28130,39381,409,42775,13,62293,3846,955,294,57286,799,39587,11,389,264,44351,18757,513,98054,42463,1744,60759,11,70374,3869,5353,409,4538,550,98078,11,50590,26633,37291,40970,409,17393,294,6,677,2002,404,6316,90509,1744,35407,13,69327,35597,11,1744,29124,73370,648,43989,1208,5636,71151,73661,648,1370,8318,27750,56321,23496,355,13,34447,294,94572,15273,2605,1188,20662,44178,16271,409,89714,949,2998,67781,11,5019,8678,805,11,5019,945,404,11,5019,3698,1617,265,1208,21934,11,3900,1826,100243,294,41901,74282,66014,3625,11384,13,12095,9189,35881,579,89,409,90194,29124,73370,648,1370,51173,11,1826,54312,1744,45602,76605,13510,1744,9189,62299,1877,17194,3869,326,6,19395,569,409,35407,6033,9148,17194,3869,326,6,19395,569,409,60759,949,61651,14707,2536,11,6502,52842,42625,13,41621,45366,25945,14707,35881,1814,409,90194,29124,73370,648,1841,9189,77554,978,23577,1744,3625,56127,15132,5636,28677,288,409,2389,5397,1744,3625,7515,3209,2439,13,19421,389,841,25692,6502,60019,9189,71751,16831,13,4418,66,41091,11,10878,519,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,51441,14091,511,1291,3625,4865,39723,653,23496,84,1826,2665,13532,5019,951,6503,2439,1515,8467,9952,3625,4865,39723,3900,1826,2665,13532,5019,951,6503,2439,3900,848,8467,11,1370,27052,68,6033,1877,44618,1370,51173,13,19421,5019,3846,20028,11,1880,665,5636,294,6,3239,42219,951,2606,4918,409,86658,961,412,665,9822,11,4864,59157,1082,6316,32118,2629,19415,5893,325,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,6316,80444,409,1239,896,1133,409,40744,3625,14240,29246,86595,14014,7010,514,38900,1765,514,27584,70927,5019,665,20028,6316,86806,1880,27584,14240,799,13,622,34155,44351,1046,12416,3869,6316,2385,409,46681,409,5636,409,220,3965,220,931,384,61320,11,3846,7930,757,29557,409,44178,63934,1291,3625,9637,2249,409,90509,665,34501,3930,53052,294,6,26125,3116,7907,7010,514,8232,13,445,1105,593,20662,37291,11,4864,91507,68226,20028,951,14240,29246,1765,514,27584,70927,11,4864,91507,68226,20028,951,14240,29246,1765,514,27584,70927,13,445,1105,593,20662,37291,11,60759,1120,57609,6316,6671,15528,11,22299,1370,51173,514,20272,294,93825,34501,29583,11,1208,21934,1826,4272,79507,5636,2267,1260,13,24703,7930,1280,2428,934,35329,308,59858,264,6502,1744,514,27052,68,7930,28068,68,13,7695,379,264,28463,514,20272,1744,409,2385,11,3625,23496,355,23423,306,1744,514,550,98078,60759,1826,4189,978,3869,6316,5636,2267,1260,28062,3748,978,11,653,5636,2267,1260,19443,84,1880,39587,3869,653,5636,25500,10025,593,13,29179,321,6496,11,9189,665,3665,89,48488,5636,1765,1208,21934,7010,514,1515,1133,13,14465,296,41901,91507,1647,95920,11083,100246,10253,3435,8467,78511,14295,13,5250,332,85815,5019,9598,12,8839,945,404,11,10071,503,34155,22299,653,1131,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,32,27387,36815,0,1102,8111,311,387,264,32185,596,22599,
