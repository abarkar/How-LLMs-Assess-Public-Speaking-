They note that every year, air pollution is responsible for the death of 7 million people worldwide, more than the combined deaths from tuberculosis, diabetes, and road accidents.\n\nThe speaker then shifts gears to explain their research focus, which is on identifying the sources of atmospheric pollutants in order to develop strategies for reducing emissions. They use an analogy about grouping people born in a specific region to illustrate how they are approaching their research: by identifying the \"origins\" or sources of pollutants and tracing them through the air.\n\nThe speaker notes that just as people have different stories or experiences, pollutants can travel long distances and undergo chemical reactions in the atmosphere, resulting in new pollutants being formed. These secondary pollutants are often more harmful than the original pollutants and contribute to issues such as acid rain, climate change, and damage to buildings and crops.\n\nThroughout the presentation, the speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding the sources of pollution in order to develop effective solutions. They conclude by inviting the audience to reflect on their own actions and ask themselves what they can do to improve the quality of the air they breathe.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,24082,263,9189,11,26077,1826,514,63669,514,5636,16595,5019,43905,23761,18434,5048,1744,326,54386,35456,25945,71151,5019,1645,9383,949,386,4091,949,98632,404,949,57895,40906,6502,13,356,17771,514,20272,409,33515,261,13,34447,6502,308,6,94896,26077,3805,13,1611,326,6,1334,4087,1880,2536,1499,72,13,921,20234,76132,11,1208,25793,409,326,6,1334,1826,77932,409,1208,10237,409,220,22,11990,409,48577,7010,514,38900,13,356,17771,5636,1744,3625,35881,12416,12454,360,5512,294,1220,28463,39015,13,362,1208,15286,69293,974,11,8065,1891,370,66522,1880,10253,33788,409,1208,6149,13,19421,65735,326,6,24105,8082,62940,20487,409,1208,77323,11,5636,409,220,24,48577,1765,220,605,9216,556,406,409,326,6,1334,9049,5485,21965,1499,72,13,4418,66,9189,62299,294,69537,541,9952,41091,1744,14707,74282,66014,3625,8336,951,7230,84,1821,14036,764,28154,14295,1826,25945,3062,13,3341,272,17771,1208,55133,14240,2070,7930,29557,2221,294,6,19010,4422,261,951,44397,19395,552,409,9517,23985,951,4046,5287,409,27750,7230,84,1821,13,356,17771,39043,1120,1133,326,6,1735,333,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,19421,5019,64972,514,60946,265,1131,14465,91507,9189,71751,653,51173,25945,4382,13,6433,981,2439,1744,326,54386,757,62163,409,1239,583,716,40744,3625,48577,308,14014,7010,653,27584,39381,74672,3257,2428,7010,20662,71632,13,27058,3846,20028,11,272,17771,4382,13,7695,8657,275,409,9189,1153,261,1208,3488,11,308,17771,54312,6502,949,1708,1105,682,2439,12303,13,24703,2249,7930,15132,308,5512,665,33150,424,68255,11,4864,9189,281,7379,294,31769,72905,3625,69236,13,25145,72,13,19421,66056,7930,15132,308,5512,264,4618,1759,949,25145,72,13,41621,45366,98004,805,3625,69236,13,43987,26178,11,91329,2182,89,52309,91640,13,24703,2249,7930,15132,308,5512,665,33150,424,68255,14848,1208,27584,2780,483,13,386,23034,4502,9189,308,6,90276,6502,409,1208,27584,67628,11,272,17771,514,27584,82660,3527,9952,11083,7230,84,1821,13,14465,7591,5098,483,43153,8336,294,31769,5287,11,39587,43153,2780,1572,11,665,3625,66517,519,89504,3869,7643,85722,11,3869,326,26248,579,294,6,412,8839,294,6,44803,325,71269,333,8467,13,48109,7930,841,74533,6502,308,5512,665,33150,424,68255,11,17317,308,49152,2439,6502,20272,514,27584,63128,295,5019,96586,49733,11,13080,11142,978,3625,123299,9004,52138,729,409,7710,13,2998,25500,11,17317,57038,951,77617,3946,96642,13,356,17771,1120,1133,27750,77617,3946,1744,4864,5320,2249,60946,265,9952,11083,7230,84,1821,665,9071,519,409,47929,3846,934,85217,3567,72,89810,37953,447,85217,274,31769,385,625,306,409,43153,8336,294,31769,5287,13,80905,22299,76076,294,6,40997,17317,7930,14848,45740,414,84,951,2960,33903,11,4160,556,951,2606,4918,409,15395,316,75104,5019,96586,3869,33150,424,68255,11,3625,7230,84,1821,56311,28463,45740,414,404,951,2960,33903,409,15395,316,75104,1880,7230,8977,294,81979,842,299,1220,13,81245,56311,44767,665,31278,466,951,90551,65,5512,7230,84,1821,16578,3869,951,9517,4109,38094,8467,7010,326,6,266,8801,764,12339,13,62463,90551,65,5512,7230,84,1821,11,76190,5512,7230,84,1821,2132,17724,11,15132,16968,28463,6033,35597,5636,76597,22589,1744,43153,6699,665,6044,28674,8065,1343,98078,48099,951,121696,552,1645,3422,11,8065,9517,6583,1386,1133,11323,266,2428,1880,27584,3869,1208,7591,49241,951,293,64272,12843,1880,951,27833,13,41621,23933,10333,934,6,2933,48226,6496,409,43153,3369,1441,76597,22589,1765,326,6,87713,1880,3625,4039,12249,11,1208,25793,409,326,6,1334,1826,28463,38605,69,5642,5019,326,41901,2842,40280,1880,514,11323,266,13,19421,5019,61512,11,389,841,25692,6502,513,550,1553,409,33515,261,11,308,17771,54312,6502,949,356,13059,519,11,389,25692,46939,1081,20099,3869,19830,14081,404,3625,82134,9517,12287,288,13,4418,66,11,33670,409,31632,3846,57992,11,503,6,2706,81356,1744,95917,359,409,17317,513,17477,20662,3488,25945,4382,13,14465,9189,22114,3869,48908,46131,1208,57146,409,1208,72709,463,331,8511,13,25145,72,13,5034,55133,3488,1826,25945,36897,13,3489,17771,54312,1744,4864,66517,5019,1097,73511,15171,1208,60128,409,326,6,1334,1744,4864,9216,556,949,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,8111,311,387,264,36815,315,264,8982,477,15864,922,3805,25793,11,11951,279,1205,311,10765,323,3619,279,8336,315,83661,304,2015,311,2274,7524,15174,369,18189,20748,627,198,791,19114,12302,555,28898,430,27027,374,279,1455,16595,32961,369,682,5496,23837,11,719,539,1120,904,3805,482,4335,323,2536,2320,980,2844,3805,13,2435,5296,430,1475,1060,11,3805,25793,374,8647,369,279,4648,315,220,22,3610,1274,15603,11,810,1109,279,11093,16779,505,88234,11,20335,11,323,5754,33788,627,198,791,19114,1243,29735,54260,311,10552,872,3495,5357,11,902,374,389,25607,279,8336,315,45475,83661,304,2015,311,2274,15174,369,18189,20748,13,2435,1005,459,56203,922,50284,1274,9405,304,264,3230,5654,311,41468,1268,814,527,31047,872,3495,25,555,25607,279,330,4775,1354,1,477,8336,315,83661,323,46515,1124,1555,279,3805,627,198,791,19114,8554,430,1120,439,1274,617,2204,7493,477,11704,11,836
