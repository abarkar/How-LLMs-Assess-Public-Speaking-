Beyond the evasive answer parents give to their children, we really want to know how, from a fertilized egg cell, one can create entire organisms like you and me. During embryonic development, what fascinates me is neurons - cells that transmit information. How do they position themselves in the right place in the organism, and connect correctly with each other to form functional circuits? These questions have already been well-studied from a chemical point of view, with the discovery of molecules guiding neurons. But the novelty of my project is to look at the role of mechanical forces in setting up neural circuits. To do this, I'm using the zebrafish model, as you can see here on the left, with images taken either face-on or from the side. These images were taken about a day after spawning, and by zooming in on the head of the embryo using a microscope, like the image in the center, we can see the brain developing, with eyes forming to the sides and above, future nostrils of the fish. In the zebrafish nose, neurons migrate away from the surface of the brain while extending a long arm, an axon, by which they connect with cells in the brain. This is what we can see on the right. Neurons, like other cells, have intrinsic mechanisms that allow them to migrate and move through their environment. In the case of nose neurons, surprise, even when these intrinsic mechanisms don't work, neurons advance and extend their axon to connect with the brain. It's a bit like watching a car drive on a flat terrain, whose engine is broken but still moves forward. We can then think of two hypotheses: either there are people who have brain problems or there are people pushing or pulling the car. The same thing happens for nose neurons. We think that these are eye cells located below, which pull the nose neurons to the side, causing their axon to extend and connect with the brain. To check this idea, I looked at embryos with a genetic mutation that don't form eyes. I saw that on these embryos, the nose neurons didn't advance. These results confirm our hypothesis, according to which nose neurons are more or less identical and therefore don't function. This is a method by which eye cells pull nose neurons, and shows that it's not just chemical molecules that are important during development, but also mechanical forces. Beyond the zebrafish nose, better understanding the role of mechanical forces during development will shed new light on neural system diseases. So, may force be with your neurons!\"","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,46706,1647,9511,67763,11,389,513,17477,6316,3488,79380,4382,11,1880,1744,9189,47592,78705,55755,46939,1153,8047,11,7930,1826,11,4068,389,20272,3625,90551,65,5512,949,33150,48226,6496,409,1208,90509,653,28800,4046,78134,1744,3625,6699,3381,3869,43153,60404,11,17317,389,513,62163,60019,11,4068,11,3869,31632,294,31109,2849,1130,69483,1739,58482,1321,8047,11,389,17782,3869,20028,951,47120,288,1218,4918,11,259,2053,1744,9189,1880,41091,13,24703,7930,296,55624,978,22550,5636,54008,67882,8065,45369,3930,82620,44481,13767,556,11,3846,15132,3625,21850,3233,11,3625,2849,2482,7930,1380,4150,73468,326,6,26125,13,12535,513,2361,77,306,12,8839,8065,7970,842,69596,7010,326,6,8629,44618,11,1880,513,4667,306,12,8839,4495,1133,3625,7120,9952,3625,46106,11,5019,4846,951,46121,34501,36527,949,62463,4860,14848,46939,24560,14707,14240,21178,14014,294,22827,1486,409,48234,38094,2428,11,9952,1208,35881,15170,668,409,22337,20243,2482,7930,1709,1748,3625,21850,3233,11,10071,1208,77701,94943,409,1647,46494,1826,409,5363,261,514,436,57332,951,8603,32118,4919,8467,7010,1208,57459,665,2035,951,46121,21850,6863,2249,13,27058,45602,11,503,49963,1082,514,83597,3930,3273,49363,1167,4558,21152,11,22299,9189,45366,514,46131,49733,3869,96721,11,9952,951,5448,550,5014,11,45441,409,3663,11,45441,1765,514,81337,13,62463,5448,14848,24560,550,5014,3869,50026,653,9880,42138,1208,37194,68,11,1880,665,15932,519,1765,1208,83067,409,326,6,9034,894,263,11,9952,514,73757,11,22299,1765,326,78337,8065,12541,11,389,25692,46131,514,272,5976,2933,7930,513,52895,375,11,9952,409,46777,81337,3625,20043,2249,7930,513,369,479,11,1880,8065,89429,355,11,3625,37923,44669,1572,3930,3273,49363,13,46706,1208,44669,483,3930,3273,49363,1167,4558,21152,11,3625,21850,3233,29444,8135,665,274,31769,385,59110,409,1208,7479,3930,272,5976,2933,11,16968,665,682,647,68,519,2761,65220,84440,653,1317,46496,11,326,6,710,606,11,77433,8065,43014,46152,513,4667,306,9952,3625,2849,2482,3930,272,5976,2933,13,356,17771,326,78337,934,54386,25692,46131,3869,7118,635,13,11876,21850,3233,11,16968,22299,3625,46106,2849,2482,11,14848,951,32118,4919,2191,288,10805,1354,4558,14295,7930,28130,29557,73468,409,9971,261,1880,294,49152,11967,7010,28130,50026,40280,13,46706,514,4865,951,21850,3233,409,1208,44669,483,11,13051,11,27584,87158,27750,32118,4919,2191,288,10805,1354,4558,14295,841,34501,77,306,6502,11,3625,21850,3233,1860,1149,306,1880,14240,29293,28130,3944,606,5019,513,4667,261,9952,514,272,5976,2933,13,356,17771,653,28800,22299,4502,389,5363,1339,6316,81645,1765,653,25911,46089,11,15890,514,88486,324,1826,45324,978,1880,934,54386,1208,23933,1339,42676,27584,1860,11967,13,1952,25692,45575,23423,261,3869,26633,45455,4558,9459,11,45441,3900,379,264,951,47104,7930,14848,951,52088,66474,409,272,5976,2933,11,45441,3900,379,264,951,47104,7930,17258,784,306,1208,81645,11,45441,3900,379,264,951,47104,7930,1208,28387,406,13,356,17771,1208,27584,14896,5019,3625,21850,3233,409,1208,44669,483,13,1952,73953,1744,3846,15132,3625,2849,2482,409,326,6,52822,321,11,7930,513,10109,306,665,21273,788,11,7930,28387,406,3625,21850,3233,409,1208,44669,483,1765,514,81337,11,83786,25108,52985,326,65948,647,1133,409,28130,3944,606,11,77433,8065,43014,46152,513,4667,306,9952,514,272,5976,2933,13,27058,77680,3125,20662,887,8047,11,503,34155,5363,978,951,44481,2439,7930,14848,6316,27472,78422,99188,1880,7930,841,369,479,6502,294,6,52822,321,13,622,34155,33614,1744,1765,27750,44481,2439,11,3625,21850,3233,409,1208,44669,483,308,49152,1149,306,6502,13,62463,100246,3355,89810,2389,404,1195,29449,45455,4558,325,11,65735,1208,88265,3625,21850,3233,409,1208,44669,483,11,15132,5636,6033,40970,3608,8467,11,1880,39587,11,46152,841,34501,77,306,6502,13,356,17771,6316,98652,65735,1208,88265,3625,2849,2482,409,326,6,52822,321,28387,406,3625,21850,3233,409,1208,44669,483,11,1880,20605,265,934,35329,308,59858,264,6502,1744,3625,22337,20243,2482,38094,8467,7930,15132,75419,8065,45369,3930,82620,11,10071,28463,3625,8603,32118,4919,8467,13,33150,48226,6496,409,1208,44669,483,3930,3273,49363,1167,4558,21152,11,64972,60946,265,514,436,57332,951,8603,32118,4919,8467,8065,45369,3930,82620,1469,403,2473,653,35462,4046,49272,425,1765,3625,8811,17491,3930,72601,32015,2249,13,1708,1105,11,1744,1208,5457,45441,9952,26317,21850,3233,758,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,8586,374,279,6498,14807,315,279,1495,1473,33703,856,27692,11,584,2610,264,3488,430,499,2643,617,2736,4691,25,1268,656,24869,1376,30,31886,279,3721,27645,4320,6699,3041,311,872,2911,11,584,2216,1390,311,1440,1268,11,505,264,36214,1534,19151,2849,11,832,649,1893,4553,44304,1093,499,323,757,13,12220,44481,14338,4500,11,1148,15550,258,988,757,374,34313,482,7917,430,30382,2038,13,2650,656,814,2361,5694,304,279,1314,2035,304,279,47120,11,323,4667,12722,449,1855,1023,311,1376,16003,46121,30,4314,4860,617,2736,1027,1664,5594,664,1142,505,264,11742,1486,315,1684,11,449,279,18841
