Three cities, three examples of cities severely affected by terrorist attacks caused by what we call radicalization. So, facing this threat, public authorities in France have put in place plans to combat radicalization, but which globally lack functionality. Why? That's one aspect I'm dealing with in my thesis and that we'll see together. The objective of this thesis is to be able to give back functionality and effectiveness to these plans. So what's wrong with the concept of radicalization since it's the one causing the problem? Firstly, it has no structure, neither legal nor scientific. For example, during my research for my thesis, I looked at the national prevention plan against radicalization published by the government in 2018. And at 112 times, you can see the word \"radicalization\" but not once does it define what that means. As a result, you're free to interpret this notion as you see fit. That's it. That's the first point.\n\nSecondly, the concept of radicalization disqualifies and accuses. By doing so, it adds more emotion, sensation, and moral judgment, but never makes sense. That's the second point.\n\nAnd thirdly, the concept of radicalization does not distinguish well between what is moral and what is legal. If a woman wants to wear a headscarf tomorrow, we can suspect her of being radicalized or Islamist, regardless. But does she have the legal right to do so? Yes. So suspecting someone of doing something legal is suspicious. What can we do? First, we need to give more responsibility to the concept of radicalization. We must refer to the law, because it's identifiable, whereas morality isn't. I can find a text on law, but not on morality. Next, we can't put all sorts of people and activities under the same plan with the same term. It's impossible. And then, we need to change our way of defining things. Talking about radicalization is too vague. Talking about violent activism is more precise. Talking about Salafism doesn't teach us anything. Talking about an isolationist group is clearer. And finally, we must absolutely stop using symbols as a means of parade. Fighting against radicalization with grand gestures and Republic flags is very pretty, but it means nothing. Finally, Albert Camus was right. Naming things incorrectly adds to the world's troubles. I don't claim to bring more happiness with this thesis, but maybe a bit more security. And that would make me happy.\"","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,25048,11,80693,417,1880,12366,13,19881,285,26886,645,11,56321,94320,645,409,26886,645,1448,680,14014,294,39346,1370,951,52309,1900,20320,288,53532,3869,3846,934,54386,917,6853,1208,18336,8082,13,1708,1105,3663,3869,20662,81695,11,3625,17258,3415,17260,586,82,665,9822,14848,5906,665,2035,951,6787,409,63922,668,45973,1208,18336,8082,10071,7930,13509,54960,893,17187,409,34501,43078,13109,13,27058,62998,949,356,17771,326,22827,951,13878,1744,4864,9781,635,7010,7643,270,4558,325,1880,1744,17317,682,2439,46131,40126,13,445,6,1735,333,409,20662,270,4558,325,272,17771,409,68226,2579,263,1215,34501,43078,13109,1880,31914,582,13109,3869,27750,6787,13,1708,1105,934,17771,54312,7930,841,11412,6502,9952,1208,23035,409,18336,8082,44829,593,272,17771,27549,7930,1826,665,5353,949,423,6,370,541,11,27549,308,26248,6502,409,6070,11,13080,16422,307,2428,11,13080,7330,52760,13,4366,51173,11,7010,514,60697,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,757,36731,92759,978,8065,3197,5426,409,27389,7611,409,1208,18336,8082,78511,978,665,220,679,23,1370,514,85182,40280,13,19421,3869,220,7261,312,26500,11,389,25692,379,46131,514,3937,18336,8082,10071,6502,6316,86806,37291,3846,1744,39043,76605,13510,13,432,5512,495,266,11,9189,62299,48647,294,6,2295,652,978,466,20662,23035,22299,7970,9189,97487,13,29179,321,6496,13,64105,64,272,17771,514,21134,1486,13,1611,2249,72,111908,1133,11,1208,23035,409,18336,8082,11,27549,841,5965,57609,6502,13,46408,834,1788,57609,13,46408,62742,13,19421,665,66517,519,45602,11,27549,26514,2182,44093,5636,409,63683,11,44093,5636,294,6,17060,6082,11,44093,5636,409,37392,11,44093,5636,409,37392,65268,13,34447,56316,5636,11,1880,272,17771,39015,514,10045,1744,503,34155,293,19395,352,978,10071,514,10045,1826,3062,66090,2922,6496,11,272,17771,56316,5636,409,6225,13,64105,64,272,17771,514,26633,90272,1486,13,19421,514,8348,13532,25253,1486,272,17771,1744,1131,5034,23035,409,18336,8082,11,27549,1612,287,361,25945,8811,3846,7930,1826,16033,409,3846,7930,1826,63828,16876,13,12095,6316,18694,409,1925,76605,88286,514,40884,569,11,3930,9880,8065,39580,93658,11,389,5019,969,1208,15562,261,409,18336,8082,11,409,18336,44618,6033,294,6,23265,309,44618,11,28800,1179,68,13,27058,3154,519,11,264,2442,12,6853,514,64079,63828,43310,409,514,20028,11,409,514,88286,949,507,2005,13,4418,66,15562,261,26077,447,22827,409,20028,79071,14896,409,63828,16876,11,39043,11,272,17771,15562,13,1708,1105,934,17771,54312,934,54386,25692,20028,949,423,6,370,541,11,3900,47090,71751,3869,1208,23035,409,18336,8082,6316,5636,25626,4294,87782,13,5034,91558,16271,8065,64079,11,66021,1744,514,64079,1826,72450,11,1208,63683,841,326,17771,6502,13,14465,94297,23008,9211,653,69067,409,64079,11,4864,94297,6502,23008,9211,653,69067,409,63683,13,2998,51092,11,389,841,25692,6502,1208,74333,1765,653,27584,3197,11,1880,9952,653,27584,98020,11,1208,18336,8082,11,6316,54613,7930,87264,48901,20028,1208,1709,67100,11,1880,6316,47838,7930,513,2322,30532,3869,18434,265,665,3941,1131,356,17771,6502,3284,13,19421,44829,11,3900,47090,62439,29449,85722,409,7591,5589,404,3625,79165,13,4366,1565,409,18336,8082,11,272,17771,21965,40146,13,4366,1565,294,6,9035,44618,16806,11,272,17771,5636,51625,285,13,4366,1565,409,4371,2642,44618,841,17317,917,9484,55455,13,4366,1565,409,57951,31398,77,17194,11,65268,11,1826,5636,1206,1334,13,19421,44829,11,3900,47090,88661,1143,272,37470,409,55162,385,404,29905,12329,951,8045,754,645,22299,91116,409,37604,13,445,6339,45973,1208,18336,8082,3869,6800,16081,409,51223,9780,37526,11,272,17771,25945,503,14559,11,10071,39043,841,76605,55455,13510,13,1708,1105,1913,54960,11,17971,8215,355,50590,73173,13,65381,8811,9859,1195,3625,79165,11,389,26514,2182,3930,8811,383,324,8065,38900,13,1708,1105,4864,841,550,10515,1438,6502,1469,90332,5636,409,7970,383,324,9952,20662,270,4558,325,11,503,6,25632,12339,653,28800,5636,409,77463,13,19421,409,45602,11,4864,1446,2192,14707,77818,2249,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,8586,374,279,6498,14807,315,279,36815,1473,9,9,38136,1907,11,7295,11,323,12366,13,14853,9919,11,2380,10507,315,9919,35906,11754,555,20320,8951,9057,555,1148,584,1650,18336,2065,13,2100,11,13176,420,6023,11,586,11527,304,9822,617,2231,304,2035,6787,311,12896,18336,2065,11,719,902,31550,6996,15293,13,8595,30,3011,596,832,13189,358,2846,14892,449,304,856,17850,323,430,584,3358,1518,3871,13,578,16945,315,420,17850,374,311,387,3025,311,3041,1203,15293,323,27375,311,1521,6787,13,2100,1148,596,5076,449,279,7434,315,18336,2065,2533,433,596,279,832,14718,279,3575,30,77795,11,433,706,912,6070,11,14188,5897,6463,12624,13,1789,3187,11,2391,856,3495,369,856,17850,11,358,7111,520,279,5426,27344,3197,2403,18336,2065,4756,555,279,3109,304,220,679,23,13,1628,520,220,7261,3115,11,499,649,1518,279,3492,330,13584,950,2065,1,719,539,3131,1587,433,7124,1148,430,3445,13,1666,264,1121,11,499,2351,1949,311,14532,420,23035,439,499,1518,5052,13,3011,596,433,13,3011,596,279
