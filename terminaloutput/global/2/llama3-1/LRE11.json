It may sound complicated, but I can explain it to you. You see the palace of ice? That's the attraction we often see at fairs. The goal is to find the exit. To do that, you have to navigate through a maze formed by an ensemble of transparent walls. And generally, when you want to avoid bumping into things and ending up with a bump on your forehead, you use your hands and feel around. Okay, here's a wall, I'll stop. Okay, this one is empty, I can move forward. Finally, you see what I'm trying to say. You progress by making contact with the walls and leaving finger marks on the glass. And actually, if a child were to enter with dirty hands, they could even leave the exit with clean hands. That's what we call absorption. The dirt on their hands has stuck to the surface of the walls. And if you enjoyed arranging the ensemble of walls so that each person who enters moves in a certain way and exits with clean hands? Well, that's what I'm doing in my thesis. But for me, the palace of ice is a kind of box where it's not people who move around, but water. And in this box, instead of walls, you place filtering materials. When the water flows through these materials, pollutants will absorb just like finger marks. And at the exit, the water will contain fewer pollutants. Now, how do we arrange these filtering materials? At random, I put one here, none there, and two here. You think that's not it. We need a better method. That's what I'm working on in my thesis. This method is... It's topological optimization. It's about arranging the materials to achieve certain objectives, such as reducing the concentration of pollutants in the water and using the least amount of materials possible. While taking into account the constraints that are imposed on me, such as how water flows and transports pollutants. To find the best arrangement of these filtering materials in this box, I use mathematics. How? First, I set the objectives and constraints in the form of equations. Then, I divide the interior of my box into several small volumes. And I introduce what's called a design variable into my equations. Finally, I integrate everything into a calculation code. This code allows you to place or not place a filtering material in each small volume of the box, depending on the value of the design variable. So, in my thesis, I'm developing a method that combines physics and mathematics to build a totally optimized water filter one day.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,6178,72,11,4864,66517,409,326,6,19680,8082,1948,1640,2428,5019,46524,326,6,351,967,1133,23669,409,5634,20712,7010,653,1488,10367,11,7010,514,719,409,7591,31241,8977,409,326,93847,13,1219,2727,39043,11,39043,264,326,6,1334,4684,76366,11,10071,4864,94297,9189,326,6,30992,72684,13,41621,23933,10333,514,11091,2852,951,2840,2492,949,356,17771,20662,33464,934,54386,4160,275,71151,7010,3625,282,90276,369,33903,13,2009,719,949,42782,424,1208,84143,13,27058,45602,11,3900,47090,30517,261,653,326,58437,1820,1376,978,1370,653,40126,409,5405,19941,18300,288,13,19421,46680,969,1001,11,22299,389,76605,51913,2058,409,513,62666,1215,1880,409,513,38831,15170,9952,6316,43746,325,1765,514,4156,11,389,69152,15907,69236,1880,389,259,9011,783,818,13,7777,11,49733,3900,379,264,6316,5405,3416,11,4864,296,6,1138,37093,13,7777,11,49733,272,17771,23895,11,4864,94297,1860,11967,13,2998,5589,11,9189,23933,10333,3846,1744,4864,5320,2249,13510,13,1952,463,18297,325,8065,3729,951,1370,30148,1880,389,379,93569,951,35483,409,656,343,2641,1765,3625,13458,417,13,423,6,52009,1759,11,653,33632,519,7930,11751,261,1339,9952,3625,69236,6763,92215,27584,513,38831,15170,3869,1208,84143,9952,3625,69236,2047,417,13,65381,5457,409,259,9011,783,40280,13,64105,64,11,272,17771,3846,934,54386,917,6853,326,6,3518,66181,13,11876,4371,1056,1439,1765,15907,69236,513,15132,5155,14014,1765,1208,7479,951,5405,19941,13,19421,4502,389,274,6,56455,1339,3869,834,20672,326,6,49575,951,5405,19941,5019,1744,46777,54613,7930,9465,4319,1130,294,31109,3738,68,85722,1880,594,7003,68,3625,69236,2047,417,949,61651,14707,11,272,17771,3846,1744,4864,66517,7010,7643,270,4558,325,13,34447,5019,41091,11,514,11091,2852,951,2840,2492,11,272,17771,6316,80444,409,712,25108,668,7010,1208,88265,3846,841,15132,6502,3625,48577,7930,4319,29580,11,10071,409,326,93847,13,19421,7010,20662,712,25108,668,11,3846,841,15132,6502,951,5405,19941,1744,326,54386,2035,11,10071,951,86374,4298,2249,51791,1821,13,3489,438,326,93847,4319,1130,8065,3729,409,27750,86374,4298,2249,11,3625,7230,84,1821,82133,274,59858,15938,655,11,16968,22299,3625,35483,409,656,343,2641,13,19421,3869,1208,84143,11,326,93847,687,72,61799,40970,409,7230,84,1821,13,43987,26178,11,4068,389,945,768,27750,86374,4298,2249,51791,1821,949,33150,706,569,11,49733,503,41901,296,1441,6316,11,49733,503,41901,296,1441,6502,11,1880,49733,503,41901,296,1441,26633,13,41621,73953,89,14707,1744,2536,13,7695,17317,47090,6316,94721,98652,13,356,17771,3846,1765,75249,4864,42775,273,7010,7643,270,4558,325,13,62408,98652,11,272,17771,1131,356,17771,326,6,19680,8082,1948,1640,2428,13,7695,274,6,74972,409,834,20672,3625,86374,4298,2249,5019,93381,71933,951,1665,22589,11,7930,15132,48416,8977,1208,20545,951,7230,84,1821,7010,326,93847,11,1880,75144,514,40970,409,86374,4298,2249,3284,13,80905,665,864,52985,665,42463,3625,6155,1673,288,7930,274,98279,981,306,3869,41091,11,22299,1208,85722,15890,326,93847,4319,1130,1880,96488,3625,7230,84,1821,13,27058,46524,1208,94721,46096,409,27750,86374,4298,2249,51791,1821,7010,20662,712,25108,668,11,503,49963,1082,3625,7033,978,8637,8467,13,12535,949,14465,296,1441,294,6,370,541,3625,1665,22589,1880,3625,6155,1673,288,11,32592,1208,57128,294,31769,447,811,13,2998,51092,11,4864,59148,375,326,55624,57663,409,7643,712,25108,668,665,51854,86696,27378,13,19421,503,55624,4653,285,7010,11083,4046,447,811,3846,1744,326,54386,917,6853,6316,3977,409,43656,13,2998,5589,11,503,55624,4558,15893,514,16968,7010,653,2082,409,5935,13,356,17771,3846,2082,7930,29557,11,46932,519,1208,51304,409,1208,3977,409,43656,11,409,72796,6033,2536,653,5634,28154,2933,51791,519,7010,46777,46110,8286,409,1208,712,25108,668,13,362,32384,11,7010,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,52895,375,6316,98652,7930,682,648,1208,64441,1880,3625,7033,978,8637,8467,5019,653,9880,11,9189,19477,52750,653,1488,10367,3869,384,2933,94773,7706,69068,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,8586,374,279,6498,14807,315,279,1495,512,198,4516,11,358,2846,3815,1948,5848,26329,311,1505,279,23669,27204,315,7384,304,264,4141,311,4087,1463,3090,13,1102,1253,5222,17395,11,719,358,649,10552,433,311,499,13,1472,1518,279,44439,315,10054,30,3011,596,279,33464,584,3629,1518,520,282,4825,13,578,5915,374,311,1505,279,4974,13,2057,656,430,11,499,617,311,21546,1555,264,36196,14454,555,459,40126,315,18300,14620,13,1628,8965,11,994,499,1390,311,5766,28675,287,1139,2574,323,13696,709,449,264,28675,389,701,52354,11,499,1005,701,6206,323,2733,2212,13,36539,11,1618,596,264,7147,11,358,3358,3009,13,36539,11,420,832,374,4384,11,358,649,3351,4741,13,17830,11,499,1518,1148,358,2846,4560,311,2019,13,1472,5208,555,3339,3729,449,279,14620,323,9564,14654,15785,389,279,9168,13,1628,3604,11,422,264,1716,1051,311,3810,449,19108,6206,11,814,1436,1524,5387,279,4974,449,4335,6206,13,3011,596,1148,584,1650,44225,13,578,26351,389,872,6206,706,16075,311,279,7479,315,279,14620,13,1628,422,499,14333,77218,279,40126,315,
