It's a transcript of a person, likely a geographer, who compares the metabolism of an animal (in this case, their cat Chiara) to that of a city or territory. They argue that just as an animal consumes and processes food, a city or region consumes and processes resources in order to function.\n\nThe speaker highlights the complexity of understanding the \"metabolism\" of a city or region, which involves analyzing data on production, extraction, waste, transportation, and more. They note that there are many millions of tons of materials that circulate through an area like Alsace each year, making it a challenging task to study.\n\nHowever, with the help of computers and specialized software, they believe they can develop tools to analyze these complex systems and create a new profession: \"diététicien du territoire\" or territory dietitian. The goal would be to find sustainable solutions for cities and regions to function without harming the planet.\n\nI must say, I'm impressed by the speaker's ability to think creatively about complex issues and their enthusiasm for using data analysis to create a more sustainable future!","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,622,34155,653,10065,409,83491,648,11,6316,38920,54951,7930,274,53149,6853,34382,5169,13,34382,5169,11,4864,25400,21559,26725,3625,49301,50026,220,1135,69225,288,409,14425,24181,2392,13,39783,37291,6892,14081,14014,11,27750,14425,24181,2392,82133,513,43678,7010,4538,2942,44618,1880,3127,52424,3625,10184,6417,812,1880,326,31769,64374,934,6,37907,687,72,89810,5019,25400,29557,10367,409,2800,261,8065,1948,409,829,57128,13,362,1208,1913,3930,1920,355,11,3900,66167,45889,7591,331,1441,1744,34382,5169,51913,582,361,32592,57128,409,98385,272,4744,2392,13,5034,10484,13109,294,83508,12843,6892,14081,5512,11,1208,76407,15890,46152,513,1380,2000,479,7010,326,6,8629,44618,1880,3846,7930,665,594,7003,11,16968,39043,11,272,17771,3846,934,54386,917,6853,514,32118,6323,337,44618,294,22827,2942,44618,13,34447,41091,11,4864,841,36731,6502,88704,68,11,4864,308,57286,664,648,6502,3625,47120,288,18434,1821,13,14465,36731,74672,540,4714,383,1880,503,57286,664,648,951,7317,6491,3946,11,951,26886,645,11,951,38682,919,11,951,21935,13,19421,27584,4502,27750,7317,6491,3946,308,6,546,6502,6800,14896,3869,46131,9952,34382,5169,11,46152,14848,11,84440,28463,11,653,32118,6323,337,44618,13,38891,89,6316,39973,22299,653,25500,10065,7010,514,43014,17317,1446,919,26725,665,79071,80444,951,13509,2482,13,19421,14707,11,5019,1744,3846,25500,10065,12,8078,6669,68976,11,44829,325,34501,1215,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,5019,1744,326,31769,45317,648,7364,818,11,17317,3567,2439,29905,12329,951,594,40751,11,951,453,12843,11,3930,66304,11,3930,281,10515,5898,11,951,32118,2629,2249,11,5099,13,48109,841,60534,2439,4046,1325,336,479,6502,60019,40744,27750,594,40751,11,10071,17317,3625,1615,316,24483,11,3625,5276,2439,1880,3625,312,15769,2439,11,16968,22299,34382,5169,1615,316,2727,11,5276,68,1880,78467,6672,15907,14425,24181,2392,13,12095,4864,5320,2249,47929,3846,1744,34382,5169,1615,316,2727,11,3846,308,17771,6502,25945,77411,13,7695,8657,275,409,18541,261,15907,14425,24181,2392,33670,409,3625,25400,71751,1880,294,6,25632,52424,934,6,37907,841,893,17187,6502,13,7695,8657,275,409,18541,261,15907,14425,24181,2392,33670,409,3625,25400,71751,1880,294,6,25632,52424,934,6,37907,841,893,17187,6502,13,7695,8657,275,409,18541,261,15907,14425,24181,2392,33670,409,3625,25400,71751,1880,294,6,25632,52424,934,6,37907,841,893,17187,6502,13,34447,5019,47929,3846,1744,1615,316,2727,6033,78467,6672,653,7317,6491,556,11,1208,259,9011,1557,1826,47838,479,5636,6485,68,13,19421,3900,379,264,48488,11,48488,409,46681,3869,51010,36501,13,5034,5788,40574,292,1286,11,326,58736,27523,13726,12339,11,3625,312,75004,5553,326,6,1334,11,5553,326,93847,11,1208,57459,665,7591,14215,11,514,7710,409,15572,438,5014,1880,14707,294,81979,13,33150,2860,11,40744,5634,59307,2389,263,1072,288,11,3846,15132,51854,43386,33903,409,11990,409,52021,7930,4319,29580,46777,76132,1765,653,7317,6491,556,22299,326,6,77968,580,13,362,32384,11,1647,42775,1826,409,52895,716,951,594,40751,11,951,594,40751,7930,15132,70720,11,1880,294,49963,12329,3625,75601,2601,7930,17634,306,5636,4382,1880,5636,51794,326,57286,799,3930,32118,6323,337,44618,409,12155,7317,6491,3946,665,29557,61512,409,51010,36501,1880,294,6,69331,2058,40744,27750,46681,13,27058,45602,11,1647,6141,3357,324,1826,653,4958,84048,25945,8791,458,13,5186,12416,39929,3608,90859,514,955,294,6,26125,934,35329,47090,14951,8646,1880,52895,716,653,18629,7591,8747,978,11,4864,36731,46838,494,2852,13171,409,342,52424,409,38546,10484,35933,294,6,41540,811,13,356,8458,757,29557,409,75871,265,5636,51794,479,3869,96642,4860,3869,31632,409,46681,1437,2142,13,42215,1615,316,2727,6033,78467,6672,75249,949,507,15273,949,3489,438,949,19421,665,74940,10484,13109,949,14465,1446,2852,653,1891,10515,10515,3457,268,7930,76605,48021,34382,5169,8065,38682,547,11,4864,757,1153,81356,3625,123299,9004,4860,13,34447,3846,308,17771,6502,34382,5169,934,35329,47090,48021,8065,38682,547,13,24703,15132,14707,12155,7317,6491,3946,7930,1615,316,479,21965,409,594,40751,11,665,16968,4865,5636,1744,3846,1744,1208,3197,66522,841,25692,5790,283,899,261,13,362,32384,11,9952,1647,42775,11,503,6,25632,12339,75831,3625,704,8839,7930,29557,376,546,3869,653,43453,36252,1291,294,58736,1601,13,39783,80444,409,1891,10515,10515,3457,268,3930,7317,6491,556,7930,46524,64,514,38682,547,10737,978,5019,1744,29449,82653,648,44829,325,2018,8977,3869,34501,1215,27220,479,13,14465,36731,46838,494,2852,13171,409,342,52424,409,38546,10484,35933,294,6,41540,811,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,27387,1495,0,1102,596,264,36815,315,264,1732,11,4461,264,3980,42606,11,889,43565,279,39097,315,459,10065,320,258,420,1162,11,872,8415,34382,5169,8,311,430,315,264,3363,477,18455,13,2435,18046,430,1120,439,459,10065,60606,323,11618,3691,11,264,3363,477,5654,60606,323,11618,5070,304,2015,311,734,627,198,791,19114,22020,279,23965,315,8830,279,330,4150,53904,2191,1,315,264,3363,477,5654,11,902,18065,4
