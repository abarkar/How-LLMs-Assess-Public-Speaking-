The speaker begins by saying that they were sitting at the bar and someone approached them, asking what they did for a living. The speaker replied that they were working on a thesis, and the other person asked what it was about.\n\nThe speaker then launches into an explanation of their thesis, which focuses on the indigenous peoples of the Pampa and Patagonia regions in Argentina. They describe how the modernity discourse is like one side of a coin, while the coloniality discourse is like the other side. The speaker argues that there cannot be modernity without coloniality, and that they are analyzing the mechanisms of this double logic to understand how it contributed to the physical elimination of certain tribes and the symbolic erasure of others in Argentina during the 19th century.\n\nThe listener seems to be following along at first, but then becomes confused or disinterested. The speaker continues to explain their thesis, pointing out how certain cultural artifacts from the 19th century reflect this double logic. They mention that they are trying to identify a modern colonial writing style and highlight specific themes, figures of speech, and silences that recur throughout their corpus.\n\nThe listener interrupts them, asking why they chose to work on this topic. The speaker responds that they wanted to shed light on the modernity and coloniality of our world in order to reflect on the political and identity consequences of these discourses, which continue to affect indigenous communities today.\n\nThe transcript ends with the speaker wrapping up their explanation and the listener suggesting getting another drink.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,426,1116,11,503,34155,3327,76366,7643,270,4558,325,13,622,34155,24560,1046,3023,8047,8065,3703,11,653,75878,274,6,16082,1557,11,389,2624,1088,11,3900,757,62163,3846,1744,4864,66517,7010,1208,17536,13,19421,37572,11,9964,66517,75249,7010,1208,17536,949,14465,75871,82,1744,4864,66517,6316,270,4558,325,13,7695,757,1239,42441,11,4864,514,1239,42441,11,3900,757,1239,42441,11,4864,514,1239,42441,13,7695,305,5512,635,11,3900,1913,275,1370,757,7631,261,13,19421,27549,1826,1765,75249,11,9637,270,4558,325,949,14465,75871,82,11,1765,3625,1280,343,4558,4978,409,1208,393,23465,1880,409,1208,7281,6241,648,11,665,82822,13,7695,20272,80664,519,409,274,55624,978,676,261,11,3900,757,62163,951,51625,6948,11,3900,274,55624,978,22550,13,7777,11,4864,57625,4618,7010,7643,3273,1557,11,4864,274,1105,6316,70477,346,11,4864,757,86345,13,2998,20272,11,3625,2624,2530,1765,514,463,911,12416,11,514,82620,11,326,6,17060,1149,49686,15132,22299,514,81337,27402,409,1208,70477,346,11,3846,934,54386,11412,917,8023,1208,6617,13109,13,356,17771,3846,1744,326,54386,17317,20605,265,11,3846,1744,326,54386,4160,275,33670,16968,13,34447,3900,29253,52842,42625,514,5553,519,409,20662,70477,346,11,1744,9964,3567,1572,11,10071,7930,308,17771,6502,9621,7010,326,6,12828,978,8747,266,13,62408,3663,61387,8047,71925,6960,326,6,454,4099,11,326,6,13885,978,3334,8082,11,1208,55949,409,76076,1069,29423,11,3846,934,54386,11412,917,8023,1208,37683,13109,13,1611,85722,13509,1604,11,20662,70477,346,7891,1082,514,38900,1880,829,1515,2428,409,34501,40280,13,7695,841,25692,379,39929,409,6617,13109,15878,37683,13109,13,65381,31632,409,3846,20272,11,41091,11,503,6,44803,325,3625,32118,4919,2191,288,409,20662,1515,2428,2033,7010,514,719,409,60946,265,4068,1208,6617,13109,264,5293,978,3869,326,31769,4763,2617,64441,409,3738,288,14121,355,1880,326,31769,4763,2617,7891,2428,951,46106,665,82822,8065,220,777,68,97739,9326,13,7695,296,6,20243,2182,11,3900,841,296,6,20243,2182,6502,13,328,35329,296,6,20243,2182,11,4864,3136,13,2998,51092,11,3846,7930,296,55624,978,22550,7010,1208,26633,90272,48901,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,3846,15132,3625,78167,409,1208,7829,1180,31037,13,622,6,49133,4068,3625,99225,12328,417,3930,220,777,68,97739,9326,7930,7591,5192,81541,3625,1280,343,4558,4978,14848,4790,3159,27750,26633,12580,13,2998,20272,11,503,6,26577,648,294,6,16288,6316,85722,294,31769,68019,77580,15235,20487,13,3959,78199,11,951,270,66474,11,951,12678,409,1742,11,951,15082,11,951,77617,3946,15473,778,14014,11,951,5554,2436,7930,5891,72,89810,51854,37291,7010,1647,43194,1880,7930,15132,57705,978,2889,8467,409,20662,1515,2428,1744,503,34155,7591,5589,648,665,55133,48901,13,7695,20272,653,13033,68,11,503,6,1138,37093,4272,11,3900,35456,653,3805,824,698,8536,13,7695,757,62163,87320,503,34155,2665,13532,409,58673,15610,1765,3846,70927,13,14465,75871,82,13,622,34155,55162,10036,48021,665,41263,20712,1208,6617,13109,1880,1208,37683,13109,409,29449,38900,7010,514,719,409,9517,1517,978,331,404,1765,3625,1615,978,45045,3435,8467,1880,3608,275,17724,2995,408,81,14014,1370,3625,2624,2530,294,1220,6617,288,55398,81991,12155,49301,13,2009,39474,409,326,6,715,52,2515,96559,665,220,679,17,61158,6853,1744,17317,308,41901,57038,6502,1913,72,9952,1208,9349,42345,978,8637,2428,11,1208,9517,4099,1880,1208,21934,64956,8047,45973,3625,1069,29423,18050,22589,13,2009,719,409,7643,270,4558,325,1826,1913,54960,409,23008,9211,45889,9517,23475,7010,514,81621,5019,64972,60946,265,1208,6671,1180,31037,409,27750,34561,2784,5512,11,7930,326,21493,306,44093,11,26633,97739,19153,42138,11,5019,20028,5201,261,43153,97222,3663,8065,85182,40280,1880,10253,2814,2617,3916,13,7695,757,1239,42441,11,4864,514,1239,42441,11,3900,757,1239,42441,11,4864,514,1239,42441,11,3900,22011,12769,16770,6033,2852,11,92759,519,13,1252,47838,2807,265,949,8345,426,1116,11,503,34155,9071,978,294,6,30992,72684,7643,270,4558,325,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,791,36815,8111,311,387,264,14975,315,4423,26073,872,17850,311,4423,520,264,3703,13,578,19114,12302,555,5605,430,814,1051,11961,520,279,3703,323,4423,25735,1124,11,10371,1148,814,1550,369,264,5496,13,578,19114,20592,430,814,1051,3318,389,264,17850,11,323,279,1023,1732,4691,1148,433,574,922,627,198,791,19114,1243,38175,1139,459,16540,315,872,17850,11,902,24400,389,279,39678,32538,315,279,393,23465,323,7281,6241,689,13918,304,32164,13,2435,7664,1268,279,6617,488,41602,374,1093,832,3185,315,264,16652,11,1418,279,37683,488,41602,374,1093,279,1023,3185,13,578,19114,29633,430,1070,4250,387,6617,488,2085,37683,488,11,323,430,814,527,42118,279,24717,315,420,2033,12496,311,3619,1268,433,20162,311,279,7106,44032,315,3738,39503,323,279,36396,2781,4058,315,3885,304,32164,2391,279,220,777,339,9478,627,198,791,11700,5084,311,387,2768,3235,520,1176,11,719,1243,9221,22568,477,834,84798,13,578,19114,9731,311,10552,872,17850,11,22364,704,1268,3738,13042,36136,505,279,220,777,339,9478,8881,420,2033
