The researcher is exploring the concept of \"naitre avec une cuillère d'argent dans la bouche\" (being born with a silver spoon in your mouth) in the context of domesticated pigeons.\n\nThe speaker starts by explaining that this phrase refers to being born into a wealthy family, which gives you an advantage in life. They then ask what the connection is between this concept and pigeon breeding. The researcher's thesis is to determine if certain individuals can \"naitre avec une cuillère d'argent\" among pigeons, meaning they are born with advantageous traits that give them a head start in life.\n\nTo define what \"cuillère d'argent\" means for a pigeon chick, the speaker explains that it involves having attentive parents who choose a safe location to build their nest, as well as good weather, a rich food supply, and quiet neighbors. If any of these factors are missing, such as when the mother is away or the father is too busy mating with other females, the chicks may be left alone and vulnerable to predators.\n\nThe researcher then explains that stress caused by this lack of \"cuillère d'argent\" can have negative effects on a pigeon's health. To study this effect, they raised two groups of pigeons: one group was given larvae insects with high levels of corticosterone, a hormone commonly found in birds, to induce stress; the other group received natural food.\n\nOnce the adult pigeons were obtained, the researcher studied their attractiveness and parenting skills. They measured the length of the males' beards (a symbol of masculinity) and counted the number of offspring they produced over a year. The results showed that pigeons without \"cuillère d'argent\" during their early life had shorter beards, making them less attractive to females. However, when they did attract a mate, their offspring were larger and more numerous than those of the pigeons with \"cuillère d'argent.\"\n\nThe speaker concludes that having a \"cuillère d'argent\" is not necessary for becoming a good parent; instead, it's about being resilient in the face of adversity. This finding has implications for understanding the evolutionary pressures on pigeons and their ability to adapt to changing environments.\n\nOverall, this presentation offers a unique blend of biology, psychology, and philosophy, exploring themes such as privilege, resilience, and the impact of early life experiences on later success.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,10467,89,45325,3846,1744,1879,57609,326,6,29199,12769,4415,66014,9952,6316,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,7010,1208,30870,1557,8345,949,46408,97583,265,514,20272,934,22827,23496,84,11,53066,294,31109,67628,436,12333,11,40142,16968,3846,934,35329,25400,47090,5019,59394,653,7970,76235,7010,1208,17536,13,7695,35737,15878,85624,294,2182,653,56430,72006,11,6800,11,12108,11,10071,76776,665,7245,483,77323,13,13789,11,10071,26077,1826,514,55520,9465,20662,87810,409,7015,484,12339,1880,3625,4647,483,12249,74522,8467,949,61651,14707,272,17771,16968,326,41901,3841,84,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,7591,23827,261,4502,11,46206,3625,4647,483,12249,28463,11,76076,23496,355,56311,4415,66014,9952,6316,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,7010,514,106508,13,1708,1105,11,4068,25692,10539,7591,5589,404,6316,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,5019,653,17258,784,258,409,4647,483,2933,949,27058,653,17258,784,258,11,272,17771,951,6699,6666,77,5512,7930,73661,79738,653,1689,991,16491,5019,20028,28130,72039,3869,326,6,370,462,951,27389,1045,1759,13,34447,272,17771,28463,653,72006,13612,321,11,653,39646,436,12333,665,27080,288,1880,951,100164,1354,6502,21965,1437,4168,1821,13,445,1105,593,326,22827,409,27750,33013,98942,1826,893,31548,11,1370,51173,11,1208,5103,6853,308,17771,6502,35597,13254,409,4538,39646,11,1880,514,8811,1826,21965,10366,978,3869,19266,1072,556,294,81979,5103,37907,11,3625,17258,784,1354,15132,1208,1056,5512,513,14630,8065,72039,11,3869,1208,16888,72,951,27389,1045,1759,1880,3611,309,5512,13,19421,45602,2605,61652,653,8631,46206,3625,17258,784,1354,13,19421,514,8631,11,9189,665,5804,72,408,23577,11,3846,308,17771,6502,25945,7970,5019,1208,77323,13,622,57286,664,648,39587,5636,51625,285,42625,4068,3846,8631,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,20662,19821,409,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,11,85434,3869,1208,77323,951,17258,784,1354,13,27058,45602,11,17317,57038,4046,3532,978,951,17258,784,1354,409,4647,483,12249,13,81245,14848,24560,9517,4581,285,665,26633,1912,288,12742,82,13,11876,17258,784,1354,3930,21134,57951,14848,312,79884,10878,519,28130,14425,24918,951,45555,2396,294,52152,9885,288,15921,14014,9952,6316,36908,409,8631,25945,9517,79,438,361,46206,3625,297,1082,12249,11,1208,23100,292,537,14081,606,13,356,8458,264,14175,285,294,6,19729,479,261,28130,53052,409,8631,11,14843,285,519,44351,3846,7930,513,39904,5019,653,17258,784,258,4046,3532,978,15878,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,13,11876,17258,784,1354,3930,2132,57951,14848,10484,3869,84440,312,79884,951,45555,2396,294,52152,9885,288,7138,13,81245,14848,39587,24560,4046,3532,5512,7010,951,4787,887,978,3916,11,15878,8631,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,9952,6316,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,7010,514,106508,13,39783,37291,409,1055,355,88025,11,503,34155,14240,21178,978,4068,514,20272,294,49152,13603,24560,47371,3372,285,5512,6033,2536,10878,519,28130,14425,24918,28068,1339,1765,28130,9504,344,13109,1877,31037,1880,28130,23878,13109,3869,409,43406,409,82134,6699,13,1708,1105,11,4068,20272,10539,5019,47929,4502,653,4647,483,2933,1826,72006,342,437,325,949,432,3675,409,5636,4382,13,11876,296,9011,645,4647,483,12249,57485,306,6316,3703,1395,13,19421,11,22299,46206,3625,2854,1771,11,3625,3703,10551,15132,77554,14081,5512,22299,3625,5636,11124,13,622,34155,39587,11083,324,978,1208,1317,79623,409,27750,3703,9620,1880,503,34155,5363,978,7930,951,4647,483,12249,409,12155,26633,1912,288,50590,3625,5636,38546,13,27058,4046,838,8977,3625,20697,21237,2748,3916,951,4647,483,12249,11,503,34155,42587,978,951,12823,409,71132,13,622,34155,55056,978,514,13026,409,86696,934,85217,2558,10994,1188,10878,519,6316,76132,11,44351,1744,1208,62827,1880,514,97418,409,15907,17258,784,1354,13,19421,8065,1620,11,934,17771,54312,1744,39043,264,33537,978,949,622,34155,9466,978,1744,3625,4647,483,12249,7930,308,6,2979,1188,6502,312,79884,409,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,7010,514,106508,10878,519,28130,14425,24918,84764,1188,951,3703,9620,5636,98385,11,39587,46152,97958,40970,11124,1744,43153,1391,31539,13,27058,61512,11,1880,272,17771,39015,653,65285,266,25945,92759,519,11,8811,90966,514,20272,934,85217,264,1188,40970,409,17393,409,2605,78,16339,653,16081,409,272,89412,46206,6316,5103,6853,11,87158,66090,63484,513,54206,11,46152,14848,6316,3703,1395,5636,38920,1744,28130,1391,12339,13,19421,665,5636,11,46152,82133,2558,556,951,17258,784,1354,5636,25500,1880,665,5636,6800,13026,1744,43153,1391,1590,288,13,362,32384,11,6502,63669,409,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,5019,409,43406,653,7970,312,3107,12844,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2028,374,264,17850,9232,15864,36815,11,323,433,596,264,27387,832,0,578,32185,374,24919,279,7434,315,330,77,1339,265,9952,6316,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,7010,1208,30870,1557,1,320,35214,9405,449,264,15310,46605,304,701,11013,8,304,279,2317,315,13018,660,50455,2439,627,198,791,19114,8638,555,26073,430,420,17571,19813,311,1694,9405,1139,264,28994,3070,11,902,6835,499,459,9610,304,2324,13,2435,1243,2610
