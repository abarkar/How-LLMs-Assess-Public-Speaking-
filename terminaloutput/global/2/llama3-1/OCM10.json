The speaker argues that these organisms are essential for the balance of our planet and are currently being threatened by human activities such as mining and drilling.\n\nThe main points of the lecture are:\n\n* The deep sea is home to an incredible array of small organisms, including benthic invertebrates, fish, and even tiny crustaceans.\n* These organisms play a crucial role in the ocean's ecosystem, recycling nutrients and serving as food for larger animals.\n* Human activities such as mining and drilling are threatening these ecosystems and the organisms that live there.\n* The speaker proposes using environmental DNA (eDNA) to study these ecosystems and identify the presence of different species.\n* eDNA is a non-invasive method that involves collecting sediment or water samples from the deep sea, extracting DNA from those samples, and then analyzing it to identify the presence of specific species.\n* By using this method, the speaker hopes to create a map of the biodiversity of our oceans' depths and raise awareness about the importance of protecting these ecosystems.\n\nThe lecture also touches on the theme of interconnectedness, with the speaker noting that \"the smallest of us\" can be just as important as the largest. The final sentence of the lecture is \"Let's remember that this smallest of us, it can be abyssal. And let's protect our deep-sea floors.\"","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,48109,14464,2439,6316,43905,38920,3197,66522,7010,653,38883,11159,13,48109,326,53149,301,2439,71151,1208,3197,66522,12704,361,13,34447,7010,16968,3846,12704,84,11,3900,379,264,409,1208,30870,68,11,409,1208,34316,283,68,88314,1604,7930,1421,283,49606,514,21901,951,296,388,13,10467,89,45325,11,11083,67,986,11,9622,46138,11,1744,20662,30870,68,11,272,17771,1208,4647,12583,978,409,1208,7479,409,1208,10335,265,949,9878,66522,34316,283,68,11,389,3567,14687,13510,13,2582,11,20662,30870,68,11,30547,3869,12155,20043,2249,11,671,1269,653,11159,1370,543,51453,294,6,2910,3433,4893,98385,293,90276,11,98385,11,97507,11,10071,4043,306,13327,645,5019,326,31769,447,31059,265,409,29449,3197,66522,13,3341,84568,15132,653,7643,43588,3062,409,1208,13826,25108,818,38450,12267,951,18274,978,598,1880,76776,11,84568,264,1748,3869,1421,10993,1208,5634,20712,7930,10390,1395,409,1208,7479,409,326,93847,13,8560,75876,43765,11,27750,98385,293,90276,15132,409,5636,665,5636,3026,582,14014,1370,3625,4197,35933,2854,33903,13,48109,18434,2439,665,3846,4545,6316,3388,3869,326,6,2227,1133,5019,326,6,69331,7709,409,12155,14733,288,88314,3916,13,19421,97507,11,326,6,28400,467,1826,550,49530,3869,79942,78,7215,514,21901,951,296,388,11,5019,665,5066,556,951,1332,76743,2249,11,22299,514,57907,11,514,34928,3223,6033,3625,2024,417,436,5518,13,1708,1105,11,3900,17317,47090,409,31326,1439,38682,1001,811,5019,1760,978,1414,3846,4809,588,4618,2249,10071,4502,11679,35285,2249,4046,9594,599,25253,13,48109,57038,63669,294,31109,98652,31914,580,5019,98054,9621,326,52152,12887,409,12155,88314,288,1880,68226,4046,838,8977,326,6,58400,409,12155,4197,35933,7010,42067,11159,7930,17317,3429,77422,4502,781,396,467,1880,7930,1826,5019,61512,4502,463,1557,409,17317,13,81578,8301,1001,11,4068,2267,6948,5392,788,949,61651,14707,11,17317,58724,951,76145,11,951,49301,11,951,5347,33903,11,4160,556,951,46415,8065,73757,3869,5363,261,9465,3625,41936,409,274,481,5019,379,23008,9211,27750,98385,293,90276,13,19421,3900,379,665,264,628,978,339,461,11,951,2960,33903,11,951,2606,4918,1370,3273,625,8047,409,34316,788,11,951,67094,582,2601,11,951,6293,102504,2601,11,951,38605,8637,2601,11,951,1499,5759,4558,2392,1880,27584,951,62197,5346,3536,11,27750,47120,288,64555,17724,7930,31807,18620,3869,40744,3625,4787,409,17536,11,27584,3869,19637,645,409,326,77025,1330,13,2009,80259,949,356,17771,1744,514,73757,11,39043,35456,3930,27138,13,19421,389,264,63669,294,31109,98652,5636,76608,5019,48908,3869,1208,27584,348,87960,1744,326,6,485,592,7379,13,1708,1105,7010,7643,270,4558,325,11,503,6,19680,1082,6316,48659,3057,1557,11,5636,31914,580,1841,27549,29557,409,85877,440,261,16968,326,6,277,21152,3930,18434,519,13,622,49963,1082,326,6,1846,45,50026,40280,278,1744,503,6,15824,285,2167,1133,409,1208,30870,68,88314,1604,13,7695,687,1188,326,6,1846,45,409,40744,3625,98385,293,90276,7930,379,18434,306,13,14465,1239,42441,76826,951,342,4558,4978,51625,285,11,951,342,4558,4978,665,34561,3869,26725,3625,47120,288,18434,1821,13,65381,9189,11,3869,41091,1880,3869,84568,13,62463,342,4558,4978,11,3846,15132,951,342,4558,4978,2082,16150,417,7930,29557,73468,11,665,3625,7591,20720,519,11,294,6,16288,3625,16948,4558,1634,30179,21938,13,2895,66096,3869,20662,48659,98652,11,665,22209,519,951,30870,288,88314,3916,27389,3532,14014,961,412,7010,514,38900,11,4864,1589,8047,6316,7558,3257,648,409,1208,56594,1986,13109,409,12155,94527,21901,82,3678,1354,13,5034,9757,8511,264,22011,12769,1952,264,71151,63669,294,22827,5636,46110,1744,779,72,13,8345,48109,514,23933,2439,17317,1474,5615,9004,13,51097,293,533,978,4108,39408,2259,645,15132,4043,306,13327,645,13,4072,645,15132,4043,306,13327,645,3869,29449,17536,13,1708,1105,11,61158,301,2439,5392,788,1744,3846,5636,46110,1744,779,72,11,3900,25692,23761,88314,278,13,19421,1760,978,713,2439,12155,21901,82,3678,1354,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,791,1495,374,264,36815,315,264,31678,389,279,12939,315,22973,279,5655,7962,64,61951,323,279,2678,44304,430,3974,1070,13,578,19114,29633,430,1521,44304,527,7718,369,279,8335,315,1057,11841,323,527,5131,1694,21699,555,3823,7640,1778,439,11935,323,39662,627,198,791,1925,3585,315,279,31678,527,1473,9,578,5655,9581,374,2162,311,459,15400,1358,315,2678,44304,11,2737,293,21341,292,304,65932,99868,11,7795,11,323,1524,13987,40712,580,598,13,198,9,4314,44304,1514,264,16996,3560,304,279,18435,596,26031,11,34978,37493,323,13788,439,3691,369,8294,10099,13,198,9,11344,7640,1778,439,11935,323,39662,527,27903,1521,61951,323,279,44304,430,3974,1070,13,198,9,578,19114,55725,1701,12434,15922,320,68,56420,8,311,4007,1521,61951,323,10765,279,9546,315,2204,9606,13,198,9,384,56420,374,264,2536,3502,78134,1749,430,18065,26984,59132,477,3090,10688,505,279,5655,9581,11,60508,15922,505,1884,10688,11,323,1243,42118,433,311,10765,279,9546,315,3230,9606,13,198,9,3296,1701,420,1749,11,279,19114,16388,311,1893,264,2472,315,279,73119,315,1057,
