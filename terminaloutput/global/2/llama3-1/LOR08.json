It appears to be a transcript of a journalist reporting live from Fontainebleau forest in France, discussing the state of the forest and the challenges of evaluating its ecological health.\n\nThe journalist, who is also a researcher, has been studying forests for 10 years and is now focusing on understanding how forests function ecologically. She notes that it's not just about measuring the absence of degradation but rather about assessing the overall health of the ecosystem.\n\nShe shares her research findings, including the impact of climate change on forest ecosystems. Her analysis of a large database of plant surveys reveals that 11% of mountainous ecosystems have already shifted towards warmer climates than before. She also mentions other threats to forests, such as soil compaction and invasive exotic species.\n\nThe journalist highlights the importance of protecting forests and their biodiversity, citing European objectives and initiatives since the 1990s. However, she questions whether these efforts are sufficient and effective in achieving the goal of preserving forest health.\n\nThe transcript ends with a thought-provoking conclusion: \"Je touche du bois\" (I touch wood), suggesting that the journalist's passion for protecting forests is genuine and personal.\n\nOverall, this text provides a unique blend of journalism, research, and advocacy, highlighting the complexities and challenges of conservation efforts in forest ecosystems.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,3436,30854,36731,665,2167,409,9757,8511,901,2933,60630,978,76305,5019,97166,326,57286,266,409,20662,369,49530,13,1708,1105,12155,369,5615,2641,42437,22626,82133,84568,14707,13,29124,66,2182,89,11,4864,100164,409,1208,296,46651,11,951,35641,625,2439,11,951,23962,11,951,82711,31355,11,16968,39043,296,6,326,6,1334,294,6,14283,6502,21965,8811,43584,62408,8486,17194,841,829,275,6502,75249,13510,13,356,17771,4725,5019,326,52152,4811,13,11876,7330,333,8467,14848,48488,409,8811,3869,47929,4502,6316,369,49530,11412,14707,6033,6502,13,81245,11427,306,665,48901,4046,838,8977,3625,3026,2492,7930,281,12416,306,1765,27549,1880,3625,7591,70,9011,2641,1744,45602,25692,20028,1345,2852,1370,45973,11,5019,68226,13510,1744,16968,11412,14707,11,326,6,3518,768,409,7591,49241,841,8657,275,6502,13,356,17771,87320,4864,5320,2249,60946,265,4068,1208,369,49530,34501,818,5019,4046,838,8977,4538,14240,266,294,22827,1486,409,48234,91329,1640,2428,13,34447,514,80259,11,272,17771,934,54386,841,25692,6502,25400,7631,261,11,45575,4068,1744,272,17771,3846,5634,258,30,74656,6033,14707,1208,67628,11,3625,92622,66304,11,3625,9259,13,19421,5019,61512,39043,20272,220,605,8261,1744,503,6,2706,81356,14707,25400,1153,261,1208,3488,13,13789,11,4864,841,36731,39040,339,4558,325,41199,16968,3846,27138,11,10071,41199,220,605,8261,11,9952,11083,4631,4558,70,1157,11,17317,14240,664,919,3625,4046,9594,599,66474,13952,4918,1880,28130,56594,1986,13109,5019,19477,52750,951,13519,1759,409,924,33920,409,28130,14240,266,91329,1640,2428,13,1952,513,62163,11,1370,51173,11,409,74940,7479,6316,369,49530,264,63669,5019,513,52895,716,409,85722,7706,1604,6033,35597,1208,10484,13109,409,66304,10237,100243,5019,2018,8977,3869,31518,404,3625,2092,82,13,34447,3663,8065,893,593,409,390,46302,11,3900,379,264,45889,65838,11,389,274,17771,259,3514,978,5553,1208,38317,13,4418,66,11,9952,514,65827,3675,409,1647,4046,61673,11,503,34155,59062,978,6316,270,4558,325,7010,1208,88265,4864,757,17477,26633,4860,13,5034,55133,3613,68495,514,9517,6583,1386,1133,11323,266,2428,13,11876,7330,333,8467,14848,7591,1677,376,978,4538,5536,1765,3625,6136,288,11,10071,389,893,593,35597,409,100246,1765,3625,4046,9594,599,66474,13,622,34155,39587,24560,23008,9211,951,2606,4918,409,79415,5512,409,6136,288,86595,5512,1765,5636,294,22827,97739,9326,1880,4864,3625,16796,51010,28111,5512,7010,6316,25945,25626,2385,409,46681,13,622,41901,16796,7591,47348,3625,4595,409,369,5615,2641,7010,3625,447,2053,46152,84764,1188,24560,86595,5512,13,19421,503,34155,18757,48021,665,4046,28580,1744,46939,665,20605,24812,11,220,806,1034,951,4046,9594,599,66474,13952,4918,14848,4046,12821,96559,5553,951,7625,53819,5636,70412,82,934,49152,519,13,220,806,4,272,17771,653,30870,273,4550,479,46939,77554,14081,481,13,19421,1370,543,4558,1001,3869,39043,11,294,81979,3026,2492,84764,1188,24560,3608,13215,14014,41199,1317,67380,11,22299,1370,51173,514,259,13559,479,951,2092,82,6033,35597,3625,16948,4558,1634,506,354,8467,6233,1494,1056,15844,13,356,17771,87320,11,41199,3625,65838,220,1954,11,326,48968,4176,17317,21559,951,1665,22589,1880,3625,52138,729,294,6,351,404,13,11876,13952,4918,2322,73468,39587,665,2035,951,6299,1765,514,25911,5019,1760,978,1414,1208,369,49530,1880,829,56594,1986,13109,13,34447,1913,54960,11,1826,54312,1744,39043,15572,68,39043,30,356,17771,1208,26633,90272,3488,1744,4864,757,17477,13,9589,54312,1744,3625,3435,8467,78511,14295,665,282,525,324,409,1208,17332,11159,13109,15132,31914,2492,30,9589,54312,1744,12155,9045,15132,8657,285,1821,30,27058,39043,4864,91507,93455,3625,369,5615,2641,7930,15132,1760,19395,14014,9952,19637,645,7930,514,15132,1069,21719,11,66021,1744,11,8065,1620,11,29449,1665,333,308,17771,6502,71357,409,47929,4068,82133,3625,369,5615,2641,13,19421,39043,11,39043,308,17771,934,31109,14240,2070,13,5034,1620,13109,11,272,17771,934,6,37907,779,1188,665,7970,14240,266,13,14465,15119,1557,3930,66304,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,27387,1495,0,1102,8111,311,387,264,36815,315,264,23672,13122,3974,505,9757,8511,901,2933,13952,304,9822,11,25394,279,1614,315,279,13952,323,279,11774,315,38663,1202,50953,2890,627,198,791,23672,11,889,374,1101,264,32185,11,706,1027,21630,36658,369,220,605,1667,323,374,1457,21760,389,8830,1268,36658,734,12208,30450,13,3005,8554,430,433,596,539,1120,922,30090,279,19821,315,53568,719,4856,922,47614,279,8244,2890,315,279,26031,627,198,8100,13551,1077,3495,14955,11,2737,279,5536,315,10182,2349,389,13952,61951,13,6385,6492,315,264,3544,4729,315,6136,32313,21667,430,220,806,4,315,16700,788,61951,617,2736,30073,7119,46039,92399,1109,1603,13,3005,1101,34945,1023,18208,311,36658,11,1778,439,17614,1391,1335,323,53354,39418,9606,627,198,791,23672,22020,279,12939,315,22973,36658,323,872,73119,11,33264,7665,26470,323,28271,2533,279,220,777,1954,82,13,4452,11,1364,4860,3508,1521,9045,527,14343,323,7524,304,32145,279,5915,315,47995,13952,2890,627,198,791,36815
