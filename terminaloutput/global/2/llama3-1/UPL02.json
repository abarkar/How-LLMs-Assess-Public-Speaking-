The speaker recounts how their niece Jeanne asked them where they were before they were born when she was just 5 years old. The speaker reflects on how they didn't know what to answer, but it sparked an interest in philosophy with children.\n\nThe text goes on to describe the concept of \"philosophy with children\" (Philosophie avec les enfants) and its development over the years. The speaker notes that this approach considers children as genuine subjects who can think for themselves, aligning with the Convention on the Rights of the Child's recognition of children as full-fledged rights holders.\n\nThe speaker then links their research on education law to their interest in philosophy with children. They suggest that this approach could be a way to help children better understand and appreciate their human rights. To test this hypothesis, they formed themselves to lead philosophy workshops for children, aiming to create a pedagogical protocol that would transform articles of the Convention into actual philosophical discussions.\n\nHowever, the speaker also acknowledges that there are criticisms of the Western-centered construction of human rights and the challenges of ensuring cultural pluralism in education. They propose that \"philosophy with children\" could be a way to address these concerns by involving children directly in their reflections on human rights, thereby promoting intercultural understanding.\n\nOverall, this text is a reflection on the importance of considering children's perspectives and agency in education, particularly when it comes to teaching human rights.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,88245,11,503,31769,2629,285,39723,33670,409,4415,66014,949,64105,64,11,272,17771,1208,3488,1744,7643,13080,4558,346,20263,818,296,26248,1153,8047,3869,220,20,8261,13,1708,1105,3154,519,9189,13510,1744,4864,841,11427,2852,6502,21965,75249,75871,265,13,29124,66,2182,20263,818,11,9964,72567,300,39043,42676,9964,1446,300,5636,25626,11,294,69537,541,949,74656,97717,11,27549,43989,7591,3209,361,409,7643,90509,13,14465,1208,60946,82,13,11842,10071,272,17771,83195,11,272,17771,57625,39043,13,350,788,27750,60404,7930,17317,1153,306,951,4860,3073,306,13327,645,11,1880,17317,7930,74533,39015,3869,293,19395,1155,11,4864,36731,78705,265,1744,39043,9189,1826,46939,69003,978,13,2998,16968,4865,11,41091,39043,296,26248,10805,27843,8047,13,19421,272,17771,22299,39043,1744,503,34155,59148,1653,1208,95234,409,1208,13868,648,9952,3625,60404,13,452,8047,32592,326,6,8039,580,3930,10891,437,81509,4242,26235,445,2877,18022,7010,3625,65838,220,2031,13,39783,95234,7930,274,17771,68866,8047,409,961,412,7010,514,38900,13,19421,4864,757,36731,22011,11,55475,9952,3625,60404,11,272,17771,3625,77554,52424,2536,6502,71686,22299,951,86696,20183,45632,3869,1760,978,1414,11,10071,22299,409,45165,1018,4893,924,75004,7930,56311,23423,261,1370,84440,1474,5615,9004,13,2582,11,389,38831,83384,20662,43656,7010,1208,26958,2655,38135,951,97222,409,326,41901,61827,409,220,3753,24,11,7930,77554,12339,326,41901,61827,22299,653,45165,23349,70927,409,64079,13,19421,326,6,12210,13109,11,19189,65699,62891,11,841,17317,282,2473,6502,13510,514,32150,556,13,1708,1105,11,16968,39043,11,41091,39043,296,55624,978,22550,66021,1744,503,57286,664,648,514,64079,3869,326,31769,34985,11,1880,5636,51625,285,42625,326,31769,34985,10253,97222,2854,1771,13,1708,1105,11,3625,19687,1252,552,14848,5906,665,2035,41199,220,1049,19,11,653,18629,62940,532,294,31769,34985,10253,97222,409,326,6,87713,11,15890,1208,55133,10474,60172,1765,326,6,1137,625,1133,36413,556,1880,2132,12267,13,34447,45575,11,4068,48021,665,99225,61480,653,19227,18629,949,7695,47090,100243,479,9517,1517,978,331,404,10253,13531,35933,281,15433,55180,8467,13,9589,54312,1744,9189,3567,39395,39723,4864,5320,2249,665,96586,949,9589,54312,1744,1208,95234,409,1208,13868,648,9952,3625,60404,841,92215,6502,23761,653,23464,1291,5019,6316,94721,86740,409,43153,97222,949,1708,1105,11,4864,841,63762,6502,13,1708,1105,11,5019,38211,20662,45455,4558,325,11,4864,91507,1765,514,25911,13,1219,2727,514,46110,1732,68155,11,39015,11,4864,757,36731,1376,8047,3869,459,3212,951,520,301,4918,409,13868,648,9952,3625,60404,11,5019,20028,665,80444,1744,3625,60404,841,834,306,6502,3846,934,85217,23423,306,11,10071,934,85217,23423,306,3846,934,85217,834,306,11,3625,1097,804,3869,6316,3738,68,74772,768,13868,2428,13,3206,1665,333,11,272,17771,409,75831,653,1760,511,1286,281,15433,55180,2428,7930,43678,1339,76076,9908,409,1208,26958,2655,38135,951,97222,409,326,41901,61827,665,409,45165,1018,4893,520,301,4918,409,13868,648,11,5019,76826,11083,7889,6033,2536,1208,18713,258,768,294,22827,19227,1760,511,1286,13,34447,3900,379,264,653,10071,13,3489,17771,54312,1744,39043,1879,57609,11,6316,4046,34985,11159,6853,10253,97222,409,326,6,87713,949,14465,841,36731,6502,15878,47929,934,35329,29253,6316,65058,43665,3930,57705,12339,3056,1748,12812,21911,43711,409,1208,8246,27584,409,27750,97222,13,19421,20662,43665,841,296,48099,6502,1744,951,38682,1769,42284,83391,13,1708,1105,11,4068,326,31769,34985,10253,97222,2854,1771,25692,12,6853,75871,265,3869,27750,665,3841,2249,11,40192,404,514,39598,44618,7829,75,949,14465,66517,326,39982,1100,8942,4558,325,1744,1370,1208,95234,409,1208,13868,648,9952,3625,60404,11,7930,1826,6316,281,15433,55180,648,5636,4917,6317,1604,11,7930,2322,326,41901,61827,8065,272,89412,409,15907,9517,12287,919,1765,3625,97222,11,45575,389,25692,40192,404,326,6,6802,1728,409,1208,13868,648,9952,3625,60404,11,389,25692,40192,404,326,6,2295,66,44547,13109,8065,19910,409,1208,9517,12287,290,11,16968,665,9071,519,409,9517,1517,978,331,404,3869,653,11159,301,3284,1880,19477,3159,13,1708,1105,20263,818,11,4864,36731,46838,337,8047,11,4864,308,34155,6502,924,12646,2159,404,3869,9637,3488,11,10071,9964,100164,11,74699,4864,91507,68226,514,20028,5019,26725,3625,46106,60404,11,3869,1081,20099,1370,91254,11,4538,46110,1448,12339,11,7930,25400,11,264,293,1188,35657,220,20,8261,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2028,374,264,36815,315,264,8753,1495,430,33511,4443,11704,449,41903,323,16627,22100,13,578,19114,95889,1268,872,80115,20263,818,4691,1124,1405,814,1051,1603,814,1051,9405,994,1364,574,1120,220,20,1667,2362,13,578,19114,27053,389,1268,814,3287,956,1440,1148,311,4320,11,719,433,41544,459,2802,304,19675,449,2911,627,198,791,1495,5900,389,311,7664,279,7434,315,330,46185,11597,88,449,2911,1,320,30690,11597,648,9952,3625,60404,8,323,1202,4500,927,279,1667,13,578,19114,8554,430,420,5603,32238,2911,439,22785,15223,889,649,1781,369,5
