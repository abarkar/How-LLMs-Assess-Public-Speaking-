{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-11-19T12:32:48.573822216Z","response":"It seems like you have a text about fungi, specifically about the good and bad types of fungi that can affect wheat production. Here's a breakdown of what I found:\n\n**Title:** None mentioned\n\n**Content:**\n\nThe text starts by mentioning different types of food (bread, croissant, tarte aux pommes) and how they are all made from cereals like wheat. However, the cultivation of wheat can be affected by bad fungi (champignons m√©chants) that produce toxins harmful to human health.\n\nHistorically, the solution to this problem has been the use of pesticides, but the author notes that these chemicals have a negative impact on the environment and other living beings. Therefore, alternative solutions are needed to protect wheat crops without harming the environment.\n\nThe author's research focuses on identifying friendly fungi (champignons gentils) that can naturally control the growth of bad fungi. These friendly fungi are numerous and have different strategies for fighting their toxic counterparts.\n\nThe text explains that the friendly fungi use various \"arms\" or tactics to defeat the bad fungi, such as producing molecules that dissolve the toxins, eating the bad fungi, or stealing their nutrients. The author is studying the genetic code of these friendly fungi to identify which ones are most effective and safe for use in agriculture.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe ultimate goal is to find friendly fungi that can be used to protect wheat crops without harming the environment. By understanding the strategies and signals used by these friendly fungi, it may be possible to develop new solutions for controlling bad fungi and ensuring a safe food supply for the future.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to clarify anything!","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,16770,11,653,7970,4411,346,2933,409,6784,70412,3930,293,11206,4091,11,653,14425,66262,11,6316,259,20430,10253,30584,9004,11,6033,9189,62299,25692,85815,5636,272,22231,12704,84,11,23317,6033,27812,66,788,13,46706,26725,3625,4865,11,26725,27750,453,12843,1744,326,54386,38831,83384,961,412,7010,29449,38450,367,15132,31605,5512,409,272,68862,3916,1880,7546,54960,409,1529,978,13,2009,10025,593,11,272,17771,1744,37953,409,1208,7829,409,3846,1529,978,11,951,46415,1056,1439,3355,89810,1651,64,16339,3625,50510,285,13,1952,3625,53051,2473,5636,71357,35641,625,2439,32118,99906,13,19421,27750,35641,625,2439,32118,99906,11,46152,2558,285,306,28463,951,41569,1572,409,98385,22337,20243,2482,25945,60014,85,22626,5019,29449,77323,13,763,2749,21041,11,84568,82133,96586,513,2840,74333,7010,3625,41936,409,1529,978,11,44829,7010,1208,3117,483,11,44829,7010,29449,6784,11,1880,36875,13327,1001,2605,78,16339,409,62281,8811,17491,13,1708,1105,11,55398,6,3457,1880,41199,6316,2960,8511,294,6,1036,14014,11,1208,44397,19395,648,5019,326,6339,45973,27750,35641,625,2439,32118,99906,46874,1339,1765,653,41010,7447,12,30223,76195,15890,389,802,3714,1339,3625,71581,8065,35019,339,2727,951,829,19941,13,34447,74699,11,9189,1880,41091,11427,2439,1744,3846,308,17771,6502,1208,51651,6425,13,3341,17317,11427,2439,1744,27750,54021,41569,8467,84440,28463,3355,89810,3869,28130,7364,35522,261,514,1529,978,11,10071,28463,3625,20183,45632,18434,1821,11,326,93847,1880,326,6,266,8801,764,12339,13,24971,1948,11,568,258,11,220,1041,8261,42138,13,7695,4498,1339,39587,10045,261,294,81979,10105,10253,17744,38647,5019,3625,3709,2058,3869,841,5636,75144,27750,54021,11,16968,665,16513,519,409,1760,978,1414,28130,7829,13,19421,272,17771,39015,934,6,40997,665,1156,48099,16968,653,23100,73899,409,35641,625,2439,1744,326,54386,71451,7138,75,1001,7010,326,41901,2842,40280,11,1880,7930,513,15132,1860,14081,5512,2107,4893,294,6,3342,5615,9211,6033,409,9517,1072,556,1208,33824,3930,35641,62799,32118,11943,13,41621,326,6,52659,13550,285,11,951,35641,625,2439,16265,8839,13,19421,27750,35641,625,2439,16265,8839,11,3900,665,29253,665,20272,951,2606,4918,294,6,25632,4558,1634,1765,1208,3197,66522,11,1880,951,2606,4918,7930,15132,35597,59148,29263,46777,9880,13,7695,47090,39587,46524,6316,6425,5019,13110,51794,479,3625,447,2053,409,27750,35641,625,2439,16265,8839,23536,1188,23761,3625,79713,5019,3698,1617,265,3625,35641,625,2439,32118,99906,13,3206,42775,409,270,4558,325,6824,68,39587,3869,22842,951,3698,1900,9465,35641,625,2439,16265,8839,1880,35641,625,2439,32118,99906,13,622,6,434,61055,409,64972,60946,265,3625,44397,19395,552,951,35641,625,2439,16265,8839,1880,294,6,16288,26077,645,6916,288,46152,42587,306,13,19421,26077,645,6916,288,42587,306,5019,48021,38612,28130,29511,12267,41569,2428,13,4366,51173,11,503,6,49133,4502,514,35641,62799,16265,321,1826,13171,294,6,3239,42219,951,22337,20243,2482,7930,82133,14091,3023,265,514,35641,62799,32118,11943,13,328,35329,25692,514,296,4091,2167,1133,11,326,6,3342,5615,9211,409,2558,556,15907,41569,1572,11,25400,4499,261,829,46798,1018,554,5019,1744,25400,841,44829,325,5636,513,52895,716,13,69327,35597,11,16968,3869,1208,37291,13,34447,5019,1744,514,35641,62799,16265,321,7591,566,268,1557,829,44397,19395,648,11,1880,39587,8065,40970,6316,409,15907,6916,288,11,3900,11412,39929,63669,294,6,533,1553,951,26467,2598,24520,31539,409,4538,9827,45,5019,43998,10515,12329,3738,288,22337,20243,2482,294,6,1617,20234,13,61651,97507,11,27584,25400,2278,4558,451,7010,95917,2957,409,15907,2849,2482,11396,2082,78422,99188,11,66090,7930,29557,3869,26725,3625,20183,45632,18434,1821,294,93825,3846,934,85217,15132,13,445,2005,9952,15907,342,1821,409,3830,68,6033,4538,50510,8047,13,19421,9189,9952,26317,20043,2249,296,1138,263,6033,12704,84,13,19421,37953,447,35329,4642,4538,2082,11,503,41901,54387,265,3625,26467,294,6,1846,45,4197,14014,11,3625,1879,12249,11,65735,3625,96642,44397,19395,552,3625,5636,31914,2492,13,19421,272,17771,14707,20662,94721,390,46302,409,40744,27750,44397,19395,552,1880,27750,1879,12249,409,12896,7930,11412,757,29557,10367,409,90194,1370,8318,3625,35641,625,2439,16265,8839,3625,79713,5803,1900,13,3959,35641,625,2439,16265,8839,25945,31914,2492,45973,3625,32118,99906,1880,15878,3369,1441,38605,9533,288,1765,3625,4046,9594,599,66474,951,71581,409,1529,978,13,27058,23761,97717,934,54386,44829,325,26725,35597,1317,67380,296,4091,15878,8137,653,7970,4411,346,2933,409,6784,70412,3930,30870,9363,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5084,1093,499,617,264,1495,922,81540,11,11951,922,279,1695,323,3958,4595,315,81540,430,649,7958,34153,5788,13,5810,596,264,31085,315,1148,358,1766,1473,9,9,3936,68063,2290,9932,198,198,334,2831,68063,198,198,791,1495,8638,555,45391,2204,4595,315,3691,320,48616,11,14425,66262,11,259,20430,10253,30584,9004,8,323,1268,814,527,682,1903,505,28091,1147,1093,34153,13,4452,11,279,52129,315,34153,649,3
