The author, a researcher, aims to develop mathematical models to predict and anticipate the risk of corrosion in such structures.\n\nThe text begins by highlighting the importance of understanding the difference between a reinforced concrete bridge and the human body. Both have an internal structure that provides support and protection. In the case of a bridge, this is achieved through steel reinforcement, while in the human body, it is the skeletal system.\n\nThe author then explains how corrosion can occur in reinforced concrete structures due to the presence of carbon dioxide and chlorides in the environment. This process can lead to significant damage and potentially catastrophic consequences if left unchecked.\n\nThe researcher's goal is to develop tools that can help engineers predict and anticipate the risk of corrosion in such structures. These tools are mathematical models that are simple to use, cost-effective in terms of computation time, and precise.\n\nThe author notes that their research focuses on predicting the initiation phase of corrosion, which corresponds to the time it takes for aggressive agents (carbon dioxide and chlorides) to reach the steel reinforcement. This duration depends on environmental conditions, such as temperature, humidity, and concentration of aggressive agents, as well as the ability of the concrete to retard their penetration.\n\nThe author also emphasizes the importance of considering the propagation phase of corrosion, which is often overlooked in current regulations. They argue that a small crack can develop into a significant issue if left unchecked.\n\nUltimately, the goal of the researcher's work is to help engineers optimize and maximize the service life of reinforced concrete structures, which can exceed the lifespan of individual researchers. This creates both frustration and hope for ensuring that today's bridges will remain safe and reliable in the future.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,20680,74466,45325,1744,27584,3625,37194,82,665,90551,783,6916,978,56311,10390,655,8811,3536,949,9648,55755,22011,11,74940,1826,1208,44178,16271,9465,653,37194,665,90551,783,6916,978,1880,514,34922,2854,467,949,356,17771,4046,1325,306,11,3869,326,55624,57663,3930,34922,2854,467,11,3900,379,264,6316,6070,2709,325,817,11,514,32232,10010,13,350,438,285,1744,7010,514,90551,783,6916,978,11,3900,379,264,6316,31159,1598,665,1645,1291,13,38891,89,6316,8811,329,648,2709,325,817,259,6853,934,80720,45441,13,46706,3846,4865,11,3625,2709,15132,8508,121038,5512,1880,841,82133,6502,69241,404,28130,436,57332,13,4366,1615,978,17187,11,514,34922,1826,3611,64,69713,13,46706,514,90551,783,6916,978,11,20662,8811,329,648,2709,325,817,1826,1208,56488,13,5034,56488,951,6916,2859,665,1645,1291,1826,4245,3869,326,6,1617,20234,1370,26633,13307,945,676,22589,13,2009,65570,4223,451,409,1841,20337,7930,1826,671,2159,519,7010,326,6,266,8801,764,12339,1880,3625,65125,37833,1439,7930,15132,30179,812,7010,326,93847,409,4809,1880,3625,297,3172,417,3869,90215,13,62463,13307,945,676,22589,16006,306,409,281,32453,95920,7010,514,90551,783,55398,81991,93381,71933,326,6,2227,1598,294,6,54553,13,39783,37291,1208,56488,45265,66,8047,11,1208,29465,4618,513,57128,11,27549,513,64592,69,273,1880,20272,4046,566,977,514,90551,783,13,46408,1589,8047,951,95159,22166,75419,1765,514,37194,13,14465,9189,93569,6669,10670,3625,1615,978,45045,13,3206,42775,6824,68,3869,52895,716,951,704,8839,5019,91878,3625,6892,10610,46138,3869,550,15433,556,1880,16961,261,514,10025,593,409,56488,7010,3625,6033,19456,1154,665,90551,783,6916,978,13,62463,704,8839,15132,951,1491,85798,7033,978,8637,8467,934,54386,917,6853,951,1491,85798,6892,10610,46138,13,1952,3625,917,6853,44351,66021,934,85217,15132,10737,5512,10253,27389,24719,811,2167,288,951,67965,2053,409,426,4334,13,5034,4040,13109,409,27750,1491,85798,1826,294,93825,3869,1208,37291,4382,294,100017,11,28800,1080,60768,519,665,4751,288,409,27138,409,5935,1880,51625,285,13,34447,272,17771,74699,39723,3625,79165,513,4684,5118,306,13,14465,296,55624,978,22550,7010,653,21134,27138,3869,550,15433,556,1208,10474,294,6,2381,7246,409,1208,56488,13,62408,10474,8024,3869,1208,10878,8047,1744,3625,13307,945,676,22589,2322,73468,5019,2961,1553,8065,53052,409,326,6,2227,1598,13,62408,10878,8047,7591,3825,2536,71686,951,4787,294,58736,3571,11,2798,14081,1598,11,2854,3748,978,8844,1880,20545,951,13307,945,676,22589,7010,326,41901,2842,40280,11,10071,44767,409,1208,23878,13109,3930,90551,783,3869,77072,261,28130,281,32453,376,367,13,62408,23878,13109,1826,4790,9486,1370,951,13519,1759,409,5178,13,2009,36706,409,7591,13311,409,7432,17,1880,514,36706,294,6,17060,5141,951,65125,37833,554,2249,13,4366,51173,11,5019,653,90551,783,3869,81098,2798,14081,1598,11,1208,10878,8047,409,5178,1826,409,220,1041,8261,13,5034,38682,1001,367,1180,31037,23289,1744,1208,10878,8047,409,2532,294,22827,6033,19456,425,1826,93381,46429,6316,37291,1208,56488,45265,66,8047,13,15089,20272,514,1370,543,51453,11,326,6,28400,467,1826,77554,68862,10237,6316,37291,8811,1037,13,24703,7930,308,17771,6502,83195,11,665,89175,13,5034,4040,13109,409,11083,58673,2249,409,38317,1826,294,55624,978,911,261,1208,10474,409,54743,409,56488,7010,1208,17536,409,326,6,283,19456,425,13,62408,10878,8047,1826,39674,14081,8047,5019,6316,6033,65930,409,282,434,554,409,220,15,11,16,9653,13,39783,38920,54877,68636,13,362,3846,357,1037,2922,6496,11,3625,24601,32118,4919,8467,3930,37194,841,15132,6502,5916,14014,13,2009,10025,593,409,326,6,6581,2159,55755,409,326,6,283,19456,425,3567,1188,296,11305,324,71686,42676,1208,56488,93381,396,951,357,3536,1860,1149,5512,13,41621,326,6,52659,14707,13550,285,13,5034,1620,13109,409,11083,58673,2249,409,38317,1826,294,26248,1814,1880,409,1709,1814,3625,6892,10610,46138,409,76407,3869,7706,12329,1880,31127,12329,1208,10878,8047,409,2532,951,6033,19456,1154,665,90551,783,6916,978,13,62408,10878,8047,87885,13559,71151,326,6,25632,14081,685,409,17536,3930,4382,52571,324,1744,17317,74533,13,19421,272,76832,1589,8047,6316,33086,13,34447,44767,653,1560,5481,404,5019,1744,3625,37194,82,294,6,2933,69572,88253,19477,12059,9952,3625,12823,294,6,2933,69572,88253,9165,89810,514,9880,13,2009,9880,841,35737,5636,39015,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,791,36815,374,264,8753,1495,430,35434,279,38723,1990,279,56488,315,9699,304,49680,14509,40073,323,19338,304,279,3823,2547,13,578,3229,11,264,32185,11,22262,311,2274,37072,4211,311,7168,323,48248,279,5326,315,56488,304,1778,14726,627,198,791,1495,12302,555,39686,279,12939,315,8830,279,6811,1990,264,49680,14509,14497,323,279,3823,2547,13,11995,617,459,5419,6070,430,5825,1862,323,9313,13,763,279,1162,315,264,14497,11,420,374,17427,1555,9699,72378,11,1418,304,279,3823,2547,11,433,374,279,69397,1887,627,198,791,3229,1243,15100,1268,56488,649,12446,304,49680,14509,14726,4245,311,279,9546,315,12782,40589,323,37833,3422,3
