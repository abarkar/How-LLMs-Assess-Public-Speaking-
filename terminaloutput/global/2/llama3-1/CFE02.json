You might think it's strange at the same time. Given the enormous quantity of waste we accumulate on this planet, it's better to love them than hate them. So if we take care of our waste... To produce paper, we use wood. It's well known that cellulose is extracted from wood, but we also generate 100 million tons of lignin per year as a byproduct. We don't know what to do with it. So we burn it to produce energy and then emit harmful emissions. Well, I ardently desire to save the lignin from the flames. I'm desperately trying to valorize this waste material. In the lab where I work, I'm already starting to give a new beauty to lignin. I add proteins to reactivate its molecular structure. It regains its weight and shape. Its mass increases. The only thing left is its psychological trauma from being forcibly separated from cellulose. To support it, I present another mystery waste material - corn stover - the good boy in the neighborhood. If you see this plant lying around in the Lima plain, I'll grind it into powder. If that happens to plants, believe me, waste begets more waste. Our two protagonists are so professional that they eventually give birth to a new composite material - a lightweight, biodegradable plastic-like material. With a precision micrometer scanner, I observe its smallest details, manipulate it, analyze it, and test its mechanical resistance. Perhaps tomorrow, we'll find this material in our kitchen furniture, car interiors, or phone casings thanks to my work and the valorization of waste like lignin. I bring a sustainable solution to replacing plastic products derived from oil. Yes, you can see with a touch of romanticism too. We can make progress. And therefore, they're so professional that they give birth to a new composite material using a precision micrometer scanner. I observe the vibrations of their chemical bond. Repeat the story... and there you go! Oh, and I forgot one sentence, sorry.\"","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,622,26248,547,3625,7591,331,1441,13,41621,26483,19610,39043,33288,665,27584,27138,13,57702,1208,10484,13109,282,640,483,817,409,7591,331,1441,934,54386,15783,1130,1765,20662,3197,66522,11,64972,348,2784,3625,264,3212,1744,3625,7591,74458,13,1708,1105,4502,389,864,77,1339,779,258,409,12155,7591,331,1441,13,350,21198,1131,27058,2558,556,3930,26365,1291,389,69152,3930,66304,13,356,17771,14707,4635,84,15890,389,11741,1339,1208,70002,974,11,10071,389,78422,12339,28463,8065,21765,11,220,1041,220,931,220,931,409,52021,1370,459,409,1647,7591,40213,27389,69,68862,11,1208,72700,483,26633,90272,9129,28674,3682,60224,3930,66304,13,1952,841,829,275,6502,75249,20028,13,1708,1105,389,1208,1437,30872,273,5019,2558,556,409,326,31769,64374,2523,18223,52087,13,61651,14707,11,41091,11,4864,46838,556,802,28531,479,33254,424,1208,72700,483,951,1344,8836,288,13,14465,52571,1080,30872,668,1744,1080,30872,668,3869,14448,12329,3846,7591,40213,13,46706,514,9511,67763,39723,4864,42775,273,11,4864,56445,46939,1370,2098,12267,6316,5017,978,3869,1208,72700,483,13,14465,25400,21559,951,1760,978,1572,5019,1208,9517,533,1553,8065,53052,409,27750,19670,288,294,6,61263,70,48099,13,46408,312,59976,3930,97418,951,1376,288,13,507,2005,11,829,58617,22337,978,3395,12267,19861,12826,13,9240,68,829,16458,554,8841,1640,2428,11,65285,266,409,829,19266,36235,52842,8047,9952,1208,70002,974,13,27058,1208,65827,268,404,11,4864,25400,30179,6960,653,47838,7591,40213,11679,12339,11,436,2642,273,409,7643,38672,82,11,514,72006,342,437,325,3930,16652,13,34447,4502,9189,23933,10333,3846,348,19395,10515,278,934,54386,25692,46131,9781,25108,1215,7010,1208,628,8511,409,1208,63053,5019,28130,10607,11,4864,9517,1072,285,1647,82,62005,665,281,3023,265,13,12095,39043,513,39904,22299,39043,46206,3625,348,19395,978,2629,2249,11,272,3433,10333,41091,11,7591,331,1441,5636,7591,331,1441,11,39043,2489,13,51097,26633,46684,288,15132,19227,1001,4913,36527,934,85217,1913,79738,1370,71751,4415,24918,3869,653,43453,5634,28154,2933,28814,11,6316,80444,409,88247,2428,5790,10676,978,56594,978,6902,4893,63828,1414,11,653,72006,90551,92174,13,62293,653,21438,409,51625,1854,19748,442,978,376,2428,4864,326,6,49133,7010,3625,4647,485,417,7591,41060,11,4864,514,490,9464,11,4864,326,6,44803,325,11,4864,75765,829,31807,4011,32118,4919,2428,13,362,32384,11,25692,85815,1744,2486,467,11,389,5019,969,38831,15170,3846,5634,28154,2933,7010,3625,757,392,645,409,12155,31547,1572,326,6,97802,8061,409,12155,4160,42204,11,1208,1080,593,409,12155,43116,17144,11,1370,1647,42775,1880,665,14448,285,519,951,7591,331,1441,22299,1208,72700,483,13,622,6,391,45808,39587,6316,6425,27220,8065,1323,16491,951,88247,8467,374,2425,355,3930,281,10515,5898,13,61651,97507,11,9189,23933,10333,9952,653,1437,258,409,68567,44618,28463,13,1952,25692,20028,1860,11967,514,38900,13,19421,39587,97507,11,46152,15132,19227,1001,4913,36527,1744,46152,33537,306,4415,24918,3869,653,43453,5634,28154,2933,28814,9952,653,21438,409,51625,1854,19748,442,978,376,2428,13,622,6,49133,3625,78352,409,28130,83199,38094,2428,13,51223,79,978,466,326,6,90446,13,19421,4160,321,6496,13,4418,66,497,503,34155,6033,2067,648,6316,17571,11,46838,337,8047,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,791,1495,8111,311,387,264,36815,315,264,10652,477,15864,922,279,12939,315,14448,4954,12571,7384,11,8104,72700,258,11,323,13353,1124,1139,502,11,22556,3956,627,198,8586,596,264,11413,14807,1473,7189,3021,12571,13,1472,2643,1781,433,596,15234,520,279,1890,892,13,16644,279,23205,12472,315,12571,584,47376,389,420,11841,11,433,596,2731,311,3021,1124,1109,12491,1124,13,2100,422,584,1935,2512,315,1057,12571,1131,2057,8356,5684,11,584,1005,7732,13,1102,596,1664,3967,430,70002,974,374,28532,505,7732,11,719,584,1101,7068,220,1041,3610,20181,315,72700,258,824,1060,439,264,555,3107,13,1226,1541,956,1440,1148,311,656,449,433,13,2100,584,8395,433,311,8356,4907,323,1243,17105,28856,20748,13,8489,11,358,85009,4501,12876,311,3665,279,72700,258,505,279,39885,13,358,2846,38643,4560,311,14448,553,420,12571,3769,13,763,279,10278,1405,358,990,11,358,2846,2736,6041,311,3041,264,502,13444,311,72700,258,13,358,923,28896,311,14085,736,1202,31206,6070,13,1102,1239,1771,1202,4785,323,6211,13,11699,3148,12992,13,578,1193,3245,2163,374,1202,24064,30988,505,1694,74923,19180,505,70002,974,13,2057,1862,433,11,358,3118,2500,23347,12571,3769,482,14095,357,2017,482,279,1695,8334,304,279,12818,13,1442,499,1518,420,6136,21078,2212,304,279,63053,14733,11,358,3358,40336,433,1139,17138,13,1442,430,8741,311,11012,11,4510,757,11,12571,387,19209,810,12571,13,5751,1403,95735,527,779,6721,430,814,9778,3041,7342,311,264,502,28814,3769,482,264,30244,11,6160,536,78130,12466,12970,3769,13,3161,264,16437,19748,88371,21438,11,358,23846,1202,25655,3649,11,37735,433,11,24564,433,11,323,1296,1202,22936,13957,13,19292,16986,11,584,3358,1505,420,3769,304,1057,9979,14891,11,1841,74564,11,477,4641,4865,826,9523,311,85
