Here's a summary and some insights:\n\n**Context**: The speaker is discussing their thesis research on the impact of software purchases on working conditions and organizational performance.\n\n**The story of Frédéric**: A purchasing manager named Frédéric was tasked with buying a new software for his commercial services department. He chose one supplier over another, thinking he was getting a good deal. However, the software proved to be complex, requiring significant support from IT staff, which led to delays and stress, affecting employees' work-life balance.\n\n**The research question**: The speaker aims to develop a model that can identify both visible and hidden costs associated with software purchases. They are using a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis.\n\n**The goal**: To create an innovative tool that helps purchasing managers like Frédéric anticipate the impact of software purchases on working conditions and organizational performance, ultimately improving employee well-being and business outcomes.\n\n**Implications**: The speaker envisions their model being applied not only to a single company but also to many organizations, enabling thousands of Fréderics to make informed decisions that prioritize employees' conditions of work and organization. This could lead to significant positive changes in the workplace!","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,46706,514,60697,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,296,48099,951,1218,2171,80463,98544,81,12416,294,6,613,7870,1759,1880,409,4294,4893,34361,1900,13,33150,45369,294,22827,409,27750,1218,2171,80463,11,503,34155,66283,978,2939,15433,39965,11,653,34361,7870,324,11,1880,3900,296,26248,15473,778,978,3846,7930,25400,1826,69003,978,13,5034,47403,3930,1515,78493,51307,2428,13,2939,15433,39965,264,24560,5714,978,294,6,613,1430,514,43453,1515,78493,5019,514,2532,8518,13,1252,81994,74608,25400,10045,1339,220,1490,220,931,33588,11,653,47838,81994,74608,25400,10045,1339,220,1041,220,931,33588,13,362,864,20762,4046,70,1604,11,2939,15433,39965,264,2665,13532,66090,7930,25400,10045,1339,220,1490,220,931,33588,13,7695,23423,1339,20028,6316,51651,3611,12267,13,34447,3846,1744,2939,15433,39965,308,49152,1339,6502,27389,46790,11,272,17771,1208,6485,13109,3930,1515,78493,7930,1536,53890,3625,95194,83391,3869,2800,261,951,76145,9952,514,328,8253,13,24703,15132,3625,98233,7930,841,274,98279,652,3904,6502,1880,7930,3381,31632,3625,8403,13,356,17771,1208,281,14140,409,84064,265,294,82405,17724,7930,78422,12339,3930,8631,11,951,2961,5615,2641,8811,329,648,11,1880,503,41901,39904,13,2939,15433,39965,308,49152,1339,6502,27389,46790,39043,13,4366,346,1744,39043,11,3846,308,17771,6502,27389,46790,7010,3625,1515,3457,2053,1880,3625,704,8839,951,34361,1900,13,19421,665,5636,11,272,17771,25945,77411,3869,523,333,1658,261,13,1708,1105,4068,62439,3625,79165,949,61651,14707,11,272,17771,39043,326,6,67816,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,14465,19477,9425,653,83597,13171,294,6,16288,3625,1080,30872,2641,2145,21041,1880,3625,1080,30872,2641,61387,5512,13,19421,4864,19477,9425,3846,83597,7010,6316,93486,11,8065,19910,294,22827,2532,264,9884,11,9952,6316,75601,347,38469,409,38317,20653,47698,1652,318,978,376,2428,11,665,296,53149,4168,519,1765,514,83597,41589,12,978,45317,2428,68866,978,1370,3625,2848,24201,1759,20680,278,11,1901,569,978,11,8171,301,1169,10462,11,1880,3625,46106,52571,1759,409,326,6,1669,27887,878,13,14465,9189,3327,2428,13,622,6,2295,299,713,951,34361,7870,1759,11,951,4294,4893,294,6,97264,11,951,42587,36306,13,19421,4864,3625,3327,2428,13,14465,3625,3327,2428,13,14465,3625,3327,2428,13,14465,3625,3327,2428,13,14465,3625,3327,2428,13,14465,3625,3327,2428,13,14465,3625,3327,2428,13,14465,3625,3327,2428,13,14465,3625,3327,2428,13,14465,3625,3327,2428,13,14465,28130,62163,1880,4864,6667,68,951,44827,5965,275,5983,11,10484,275,5983,11,41645,59307,13,622,6,44803,325,9952,1647,9511,67763,11,514,445,2871,7934,11,5019,19477,52750,1647,83597,13,2895,66096,3869,3846,83597,11,20662,93486,9721,5048,11412,834,20672,3930,21134,704,321,13171,294,6,16288,3625,25949,1765,3625,4787,409,42775,1880,1765,326,6,58904,3930,42775,13,19421,4864,100164,27584,5636,78060,7010,326,6,5389,404,13,14465,100164,653,83597,41589,12,978,45317,2428,274,6,6517,519,519,7010,40744,3625,97263,11,7010,26725,3625,3600,294,6,97264,13,3959,2606,4918,409,2939,15433,978,6329,2107,4893,294,6,16288,11,87451,326,6,533,68,294,6,97264,11,326,6,58400,1765,3625,4787,409,42775,1880,1765,326,6,58904,13,19421,39043,11,9189,841,26483,19610,6502,1744,39043,11412,62439,3625,4787,409,17536,8065,42775,949,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,32,27387,36815,0,5810,596,264,12399,323,1063,26793,1473,9,9,2014,96618,578,19114,374,25394,872,17850,3495,389,279,5536,315,3241,24393,389,3318,4787,323,41295,5178,382,9,9,791,3446,315,2939,15433,39965,96618,362,23395,6783,7086,2939,15433,39965,574,51920,449,12096,264,502,3241,369,813,8518,3600,9476,13,1283,14896,832,19353,927,2500,11,7422,568,574,3794,264,1695,3568,13,4452,11,279,3241,19168,311,387,6485,11,23537,5199,1862,505,8871,5687,11,902,6197,311,32174,323,8631,11,28987,8420,6,990,26928,8335,382,9,9,791,3495,3488,96618,578,19114,22262,311,2274,264,1646,430,649,10765,2225,9621,323,8340,7194,5938,449,3241,24393,13,2435,527,1701,264,9709,51397,82,5603,11,35271,62129,323,47616,828,4526,323,6492,382,9,9,791,5915,96618,2057,1893,459,18699,5507,430,8779,23395,20258,1093,2939,15433,39965,48248,279,5536,315,3241,24393,389,3318,4787,323,41295,5178,11,13967,18899,9548,1664,33851,323,2626,20124,382,9,9,26282,10939,96618,578,19114,665,41115,872,1646,1694,9435,539,1193,311,264,3254,2883,719,1101,311,1690,11351,11,28462,9214,315,2939,978,1126,1233,311,1304,16369,11429,430,63652,8420,6,4787,315,990,323,7471,13,1115,1436,3063,311,5199,6928,4442,304,279,27465,0,128009],"total_duration":8819095056,"load_duration":285764,"prompt_eval_count":665,"prompt_eval_duration":1312546000,"eval_count":247,"eval_duration":7505475000}
