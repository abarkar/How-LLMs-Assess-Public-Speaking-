The speaker starts by sharing a childhood memory of their grandmother asking them to pee on rhubarb, which sparked an interest in exploring the role of urine in agriculture.\n\nThe presentation then delves into the scientific aspects of urine, highlighting that it contains nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium that are essential for plant growth. The speaker notes that historically, human waste was used as fertilizer, but with the advent of petrochemistry, synthetic fertilizers became more widely used, and urine was seen as useless.\n\nHowever, the speaker argues that this linear and polluting approach to waste management is unsustainable and points out that if we were to recycle urine on a large scale, it could provide 25 million baguettes' worth of fertilizer per day. The current recycling rate for nitrogen in Paris is only 5%, compared to around 50% in the past.\n\nThe speaker suggests that a circular approach to managing waste, including separating urine from other waste and treating it as a valuable resource, is essential for preserving planetary balances. They conclude by highlighting the need to analyze and work on the social, economic, and cultural conditions necessary to make this transition possible.\n\nOverall, the presentation aims to raise awareness about the importance of urine recycling in ecological transition and encourages listeners to consider alternative approaches to waste management that prioritize circularity and sustainability.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,2052,261,20028,24547,72,1765,1208,22408,45597,1395,13,29179,321,6496,3846,1744,7631,1339,7643,6800,1474,12339,3869,15907,86696,21430,69,1821,13,362,326,31769,5481,593,11,4864,308,6,4202,2852,56316,23423,978,1744,503,65948,2852,20028,409,1208,38317,1765,514,24547,72,13,19421,76776,11,4864,308,6,4202,2852,56316,43306,978,1744,1370,20662,95234,11,7643,6800,1474,12339,5899,1339,25692,85815,6316,951,1206,5512,409,1208,9320,91329,1640,2428,13,46706,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,14425,1082,3625,100246,409,96642,49255,7330,333,8467,5019,8678,805,1208,59471,951,3521,81,10515,919,2854,33903,13,80905,294,6,370,541,11,1208,4571,72,38469,3930,34922,2854,467,20605,265,1744,272,17771,1370,3625,4433,1572,1744,514,34922,51913,582,361,1208,3682,13109,951,10184,6417,812,11,326,6,1394,1295,951,1760,978,1572,11,3625,274,2053,1332,76743,2249,22299,514,33088,461,6033,514,62275,13,445,6,351,2298,316,648,11,27549,11,17317,20605,265,1744,3625,6136,288,513,46798,81,79738,1120,1133,409,27750,10184,6417,812,1880,1744,326,6,324,483,1826,653,9250,51155,2852,13,2998,5589,11,3625,7135,80463,20605,8135,934,81991,12366,11,8065,1630,5511,68,97739,9326,11,653,951,1665,22589,21901,2908,12249,409,1208,59471,951,3521,81,10515,919,2854,33903,43989,409,14448,12329,3625,4433,1572,5019,30870,566,261,3846,11008,951,10184,6417,812,13,19421,44829,11,8065,30388,68,97739,9326,11,1208,281,10515,299,331,318,648,1826,69003,8047,13,1952,274,17771,5906,3869,43998,10515,12329,951,51155,2852,38094,8467,3869,6800,5790,4057,294,6,67229,7063,65,1439,26495,3742,1880,3625,4433,1572,2854,33903,15132,409,46469,304,332,3742,13,4366,1208,27306,668,3869,523,13559,294,93847,1880,514,16968,3869,326,6,19395,412,11,389,3625,264,17004,5512,3869,1208,44229,20712,13,5034,60128,409,326,93847,951,436,33920,31539,1826,409,7287,35205,22761,2428,11,45575,389,264,1913,72,1370,19477,52750,951,603,1572,294,31769,79,2060,13,34447,665,18027,519,3625,384,12249,294,6,19395,412,11,27750,603,1572,841,1370,10176,89810,6502,3869,79196,52424,326,6,833,41098,12657,354,978,13,3489,6853,4824,53410,758,12095,389,14448,285,1339,326,6,324,483,409,26725,3625,14464,1821,409,326,6,351,6200,316,53301,41958,26584,5019,36214,12329,3930,1529,978,11,389,92215,2558,556,220,914,11990,409,9145,14127,2392,409,6784,1370,9880,13,19421,5019,61512,11,75804,88253,7010,20662,945,6200,316,53301,11,514,9637,2249,409,92465,425,409,326,6,1394,1295,308,17771,1744,409,220,20,13689,45575,934,35329,43989,294,41901,2842,220,1135,4,3900,379,264,653,97739,9326,13,1952,264,68866,978,653,72601,10006,978,12267,1880,7230,28674,7010,514,43014,389,54206,409,326,6,1394,1295,11,389,259,361,951,51155,2852,294,22827,81337,1880,389,3625,7591,376,3159,409,326,49455,265,13,27058,27389,4120,3625,94527,4046,447,31059,417,3197,10515,17724,11,3900,2267,664,14687,38831,15170,6316,59471,4319,74775,951,4433,1572,13,12095,9189,47592,653,91399,11,9189,45366,46932,265,514,31025,321,409,7643,6800,1474,12339,1880,36214,12329,15265,3419,1435,3869,326,6,324,483,13,34447,7930,294,6,40997,17317,4612,535,4538,1529,978,1880,20272,4538,6784,949,46706,29449,77824,16036,285,8047,11,39723,326,54386,1179,68,3625,10184,6417,812,7010,1208,39973,11,3900,2267,664,14687,2942,12329,514,54606,409,27750,10184,6417,812,5553,3625,27833,13,19421,4068,20028,665,95234,949,4241,9425,1208,27306,668,3869,19266,36235,294,6,324,483,11,55398,6,2933,13988,15433,978,409,89714,5019,665,20028,653,51155,2852,91329,1640,2428,11,503,34155,81621,665,5891,361,653,6800,13026,409,12823,7930,3073,306,46939,13,423,5512,494,2852,11,653,951,665,3841,2249,21901,2908,12249,1826,294,6,44803,805,1880,409,58673,15610,1765,3625,4787,65207,11,82653,8467,1880,7829,75,645,7930,29557,376,546,2486,467,409,30870,566,261,3846,11008,409,326,6,1394,1295,13,2998,57485,519,7643,270,4558,325,665,220,18,4520,11,503,6,25632,12339,4799,12329,6316,55133,3044,11,1208,85424,409,42563,1744,20662,9320,91329,1640,2428,513,28068,68,28463,7010,12155,27306,2392,13,25145,72,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,791,1495,374,264,36815,315,264,15864,922,279,12939,315,40335,34978,323,1202,4754,311,17210,311,50953,9320,13,578,19114,8638,555,11821,264,20587,5044,315,872,39284,10371,1124,311,65238,389,22408,45597,65,11,902,41544,459,2802,304,24919,279,3560,315,40335,304,30029,627,198,791,15864,1243,1624,2396,1139,279,12624,13878,315,40335,11,39686,430,433,5727,37493,1778,439,47503,11,33088,30969,11,323,62275,430,527,7718,369,6136,6650,13,578,19114,8554,430,35901,11,3823,12571,574,1511,439,65391,11,719,449,279,11599,315,6896,299,52755,11,28367,36214,12509,6244,810,13882,1511,11,323,40335,574,3970,439,29948,627,198,11458,11,279,19114,29633,430,420,13790,323,7230,10831,5603,311,12571,6373,374,98609,323,3585,704,430,422,584,1051,311,61843,40335,389,264,3544,5569,11,433,1436,3493,220,914,3610,9145,14127,2392,6,5922,315,65391,824,1938,13,578,1510,34978,4478,369,47503,304,12366,374,1193,220,20,13689,7863,311,2212,220,1135,4,304,
