The speaker, Charlotte, is discussing her thesis research on the relationships between the female body and crime in medieval France.\n\nCharlotte begins by referencing a song by French singer Alain Souchon that pokes fun at societal preoccupations with what happens under women's skirts. She then launches into her presentation, which focuses on three examples of how the female body was linked to crime in medieval France.\n\nThe first example involves an adulterous or fornicating woman who may have produced illegitimate children. The second example concerns Pierrette, a married woman who employed several servants at Chartres in 1394. When one of her servants became bold, he was killed by Pierrette and her husband, highlighting how the female body was often the site of crime.\n\nCharlotte then discusses her archival research, which involved photographing and transcribing hundreds of judicial records from the National Archives. She used these records to create a database and conduct statistical analyses, ultimately finding that women's identities were often tied to what happened under their skirts (i.e., how well they governed their bodies).\n\nThe third example involves Marguerite, who insulted Jeanne de \"putain prêtresse\" during Mass at Tours in 1476. This episode highlights not only men surveilling women but also women surveilling each other and sometimes turning on each other.\n\nCharlotte concludes that the body played a crucial role in defining medieval identities, particularly for women. She emphasizes that her research is not about lifting up women's skirts but rather about understanding the concept of the body, its gendered relationships, and how it evolved (or didn't) over time.\n\nFinally, Charlotte notes that many people may think that her topic is outdated or only relevant to medieval times, but she argues that issues like consent, power dynamics, and gendered violence are timeless and continue to be relevant today (e.g., the #MeToo movement).","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,4366,3846,51655,409,23572,288,11,46131,32592,3625,503,455,288,951,56127,13,41621,1208,4635,2852,53070,20662,523,37645,294,6,2149,467,328,3102,263,949,46408,757,61158,6853,1647,70927,409,270,4558,325,13,46706,20662,523,37645,11,326,6,26380,13109,43905,1218,20712,87264,1536,77,392,321,8047,1370,3846,7930,513,39904,32592,3625,503,455,288,951,56127,13,19421,45602,76069,404,1339,27584,3869,951,83977,1220,13,19421,14707,7216,89,45325,934,35329,379,264,50026,220,5067,8261,11,7010,514,938,7911,3972,409,9822,11,3846,7930,513,39904,32592,3625,503,455,288,951,56127,490,582,13559,46939,28463,48488,13,2998,59157,13109,11,503,57286,664,648,3625,7477,3476,9465,514,34922,58482,1083,258,1880,514,9977,3869,1208,1913,3930,77638,268,12,33895,713,13,19421,4864,91507,9189,1647,95920,934,2053,15132,27750,7477,3476,13,20210,51173,11,514,4865,3930,34922,58482,1083,258,11,70927,3930,9977,13,4366,51173,11,1208,18694,6822,12339,6033,369,11851,68636,7930,92215,2995,408,38149,951,60404,5986,978,13178,1769,11,4160,556,5636,4502,3611,2381,5512,13,1611,2249,90272,51173,11,653,28800,5636,6485,68,13,48109,4160,3457,3869,21964,417,665,220,1032,6281,13,356,17771,39015,1744,13458,21377,68028,11,6316,18694,12985,8047,7930,8654,385,648,51854,4958,635,1759,13,2582,11,653,9880,11,326,22827,409,15907,4958,635,1759,297,325,21901,265,13,7695,274,6,74972,294,31109,523,37645,1099,6632,1082,3869,4538,70927,13,2009,34922,409,21377,68028,1826,3869,1208,37291,326,6,67816,294,22827,21134,9977,11,326,6,67816,409,1208,523,37645,1099,6632,1082,11,409,326,6,1354,495,68,13,34447,514,34922,409,21377,68028,1826,28463,514,6505,294,22827,2132,9977,13,34447,26077,1826,39587,3846,2132,9977,949,19421,14707,3846,308,17771,13080,5636,13080,40970,1744,326,39982,3151,579,3930,11412,1169,9964,978,1370,21377,68028,27549,98375,1880,1370,4538,12985,13,4418,66,9189,23933,10333,11,503,6,26577,648,409,60946,265,4068,26725,27750,17073,29059,275,306,90053,3930,34922,58482,1083,258,13,19421,272,3433,10333,1474,6870,11,3900,379,665,264,653,7251,24181,13,1708,1105,5019,3846,20028,11,4864,36731,682,8047,10253,39104,7140,3916,13,622,59858,16796,10512,72,978,951,2960,33903,294,82405,17724,5860,24985,3946,13,14465,3625,16796,42590,24143,11,4864,3625,16796,665,49564,14014,7010,7643,2385,409,46681,13,19421,3900,296,26248,4498,84,665,20272,20028,951,5935,82,11,951,20719,8467,13,61651,97507,11,66021,934,41901,87810,11,389,20272,28463,951,71808,13,19421,8065,1620,11,4864,738,349,1744,326,6,1748,13109,951,31656,7591,3825,71151,409,3846,7930,513,39904,32592,28130,10479,375,13,1708,1105,5019,20028,4382,11,294,22827,81337,17317,57038,3625,31656,14707,85182,77,14014,409,28130,34922,11,1880,409,326,49455,265,11,17317,57038,3625,31656,8811,85182,77,14014,409,28130,34922,13,11876,31656,1081,8699,11,19637,645,7930,15132,15765,484,14014,11,81186,1370,3625,53542,13,1708,1105,6666,11,16968,308,17771,6502,4502,490,3581,978,13,19881,13532,25253,1880,62891,51173,11,20662,37291,63484,17317,74533,3869,57149,11,665,220,975,4767,13,356,17771,326,6,75876,409,1208,11083,325,11,1880,272,17771,7010,326,31769,6200,1082,1744,24079,8977,635,27224,68,20263,818,409,12769,2231,467,550,49530,22550,88991,9648,55755,22011,11,27549,326,69537,817,409,272,24889,9952,514,550,38816,13,4418,66,9189,23933,10333,11,2536,71686,3625,53542,15765,484,306,3625,31656,11,10071,3625,31656,28463,513,15765,484,306,9465,84568,11,1880,513,17634,306,1370,86633,25945,8811,3536,13,4418,66,3846,934,35329,47090,312,2002,404,11,272,17771,1744,514,34922,28068,68,653,436,57332,3062,7010,1208,47371,4144,409,326,6,1748,13109,951,32118,8747,978,6723,2249,11,1880,81186,951,31656,32118,8747,118904,3916,13,7695,841,274,6,74972,2536,6502,409,5945,72905,3625,503,455,288,951,56127,11,10071,96308,409,5945,72905,1208,3488,409,1208,43656,3930,34922,11,409,4538,39474,4173,43711,11,1880,409,4538,51913,3294,11,6033,6502,11,7010,514,27138,13,1708,1105,503,34155,48488,294,58591,285,7930,757,834,306,12769,10071,29473,11,8941,70927,409,270,4558,325,42676,27584,11,514,77638,268,12,33895,713,11,74940,84411,536,758,8345,11842,10071,11,9189,4635,2852,53070,26725,49733,514,55392,1604,34422,56682,11,12769,8335,8941,4247,66,65801,12769,757,2288,88991,64105,64,841,9189,61158,6853,6502,653,70927,409,270,4558,325,949,435,2259,1001,11,9189,274,34886,294,69537,541,9952,41091,11,16968,3846,7930,1826,77638,268,12,33895,713,2249,11,308,17771,6502,83187,8065,77638,268,12,33895,713,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2028,8111,311,387,264,36815,315,264,15864,477,31678,389,279,8712,315,330,2356,34922,58482,1083,258,1880,514,9977,3869,1208,1913,3930,77638,268,12,33895,713,1,320,791,29738,14285,323,24845,304,36931,78248,9822,570,578,19114,11,29473,11,374,25394,1077,17850,3495,389,279,12135,1990,279,8954,2547,323,9977,304,42108,9822,627,198,96995,12302,555,57616,264,5609,555,8753,23597,1708,467,328,3102,263,430,281,8099,2523,520,59529,864,24719,811,449,1148,8741,1234,3278,596,77
