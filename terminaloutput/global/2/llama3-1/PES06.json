Preventing this phenomenon is particularly complex because this gas is invisible, odorless, and tasteless. To establish effective treatments, it is also important to understand precisely how this seemingly harmless gas affects our organism. The first answer lies in our respiratory mechanism. Oxygen that we breathe is transported through the blood to a protein called myoglobin, which stores and redistributes oxygen to muscle tissues. And that's where our culprit gas intervenes. It seizes the place of oxygen at this protein, disrupting the supply of oxygen to muscles and our body can no longer sustain itself.\n\nMore precisely, carbon monoxide binds to an atom located at the center of the protein, which is represented in the visual accompanying me. You can see this protein as a complex labyrinth with the binding atom at its center. To study this phenomenon of binding more deeply, it is important to be able to simulate it, for example on a computer. To do this, we use mathematical models that will describe the interaction between the carbon monoxide molecule and the protein. We then realize that the structure of the protein and therefore the contours of this labyrinth change over time. As for the carbon monoxide molecule, once inside the labyrinth, it heads towards the center, i.e., the atom on which it will try to bind. And when it reaches a dead end, it simply waits for a change in the configuration of the labyrinth to find a new path.\n\nVery well, you'll say. Only, these openings can take a very long time before appearing, typically after millions of iterations on our algorithm. During this time, the molecule remains blocked in the labyrinth and researchers get impatient in front of their computer. My thesis work consists in proving that there is a much faster way to simulate these appearances of path. I say that if my molecule stays enough time blocked in this labyrinth, it forgets all its past trajectory. I can then find a way to simulate future trajectories on several processors in parallel, which will allow me to significantly reduce the simulation time.\n\nBeyond this public health issue, there are actually many other physical systems where these results could be used. Like how mathematics, no matter how abstract they may seem, can help us better understand the world we live in.

you.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,2998,9822,11,389,42463,46777,76132,5636,409,220,18,931,72815,811,8065,40774,4223,451,409,1841,20337,11,15890,6316,2960,8511,409,35881,12416,951,56264,409,27750,72815,811,13,5034,27389,7611,409,3846,1343,98078,48099,1826,54008,67882,6485,68,11,1841,3846,56086,11,665,5636,294,93825,30547,11,1826,304,68565,1880,1280,337,461,13,362,5589,294,31769,74199,404,951,9781,1224,812,1008,978,447,1900,11,3900,1826,44767,3062,409,60946,265,51625,285,42625,4068,3846,56086,294,53149,69777,304,1885,4114,945,275,1765,29449,2942,44618,13,39783,55133,90509,513,71451,7010,29449,32118,4919,44618,409,594,29579,13,445,6,61263,70,48099,1744,17317,33515,2439,1826,264,2464,258,978,3869,30517,514,29340,55398,81991,6316,1760,978,483,76190,8047,856,76525,483,7930,5708,68,1880,8873,361,42067,99690,70,48099,5553,3625,259,1056,355,3167,3395,17724,13,19421,14707,272,17771,39015,934,55624,651,1188,29449,56086,86032,30808,13,7695,274,69537,391,548,1208,2035,409,326,6,61263,70,48099,46206,20662,1760,978,483,11,18713,9225,519,44351,326,6,391,403,294,6,61263,70,48099,5553,3625,24569,1880,29449,2942,44618,308,6,1138,535,5636,3869,5258,1601,13,12623,51625,285,42625,11,514,40774,4223,451,409,1841,20337,513,5155,68,3869,653,520,638,10109,978,8065,12541,409,1208,1760,978,483,11,7930,1826,294,6,52009,1759,91678,978,1765,514,2145,4088,7930,296,6,582,5807,24812,13,41621,45366,46131,20662,1760,978,483,22299,653,326,58437,1820,6485,68,8065,12541,3930,43014,29059,635,326,6,266,638,908,519,13,362,5589,294,57286,664,1291,3846,1343,98078,48099,409,83199,5636,665,2848,17675,324,11,3900,1826,3062,409,68226,514,1675,8646,11,1370,51173,1765,6141,3357,324,13,27058,45602,11,389,20272,76190,3869,951,1491,85798,7033,978,8637,8467,7930,82133,7591,68019,326,6,69175,9465,1208,22337,20243,1130,409,1647,62868,606,1880,1208,1760,978,483,13,1952,513,17634,42463,45575,409,1208,14896,46932,5048,13,5034,6070,409,1208,1760,978,483,1880,39587,3625,50131,409,3846,326,58437,1820,30870,16149,9952,514,27138,13,32541,3869,1208,22337,20243,1130,409,40774,4223,451,409,1841,20337,11,6316,37291,7010,3846,326,58437,1820,11,27549,513,5534,7404,665,5216,3930,12541,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,409,326,6,266,638,1765,514,43014,27549,11412,259,1992,409,513,5155,261,13,19421,37953,447,80720,17782,3869,6316,3242,13559,11,27549,9604,71357,653,2609,1133,409,6683,3930,326,58437,1820,5019,68226,513,1448,1155,3869,653,43453,88768,13,1183,12416,14707,11,757,13510,89,45325,13,1369,84,1001,11,27750,6033,1653,1439,56311,59394,653,27138,25945,1317,33670,294,53149,5169,66014,11,3666,81235,8065,25646,409,11990,294,6,13109,81,811,1765,29449,453,6191,2727,13,81501,3846,27138,2922,6496,11,1208,22337,20243,1130,66167,14545,447,8047,7010,514,326,58437,1820,1880,3625,52571,1759,274,98279,23557,306,77558,28130,6141,3357,324,13,3206,42775,409,270,4558,325,6824,68,45575,3869,550,15170,934,35329,29253,653,91116,14707,5636,76608,409,1675,8646,27750,34388,6055,409,88768,13,14465,834,1744,4502,7643,22337,20243,1130,66167,8657,285,64656,1317,67380,14545,447,8047,7010,3846,326,58437,1820,11,27549,6033,2067,648,43905,829,9781,585,42827,1522,8047,13,14465,94297,45575,46524,653,91116,409,1675,8646,1208,9781,585,42827,3938,1765,51854,29394,325,1759,665,1370,543,51453,11,3846,7930,11412,757,29557,10367,409,9517,1072,556,409,85722,4698,1413,514,27138,409,19576,13,33150,48226,6496,409,20662,3488,409,77323,6814,37526,11,3900,29253,665,20272,14707,294,81979,42345,66474,4571,8467,1765,3625,447,2053,27750,100246,5019,969,1188,23761,42587,5512,13,1219,2727,75249,3625,7033,978,8637,8467,11,28463,671,496,1339,288,779,1188,12,37907,11,56311,17317,29557,10367,409,64972,60946,265,514,38900,7010,514,43014,17317,18434,2439,13,14465,9189,312,1195,25134,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,8586,374,279,11093,1495,512,198,644,9822,11,927,220,18,11,931,1274,527,87523,555,12782,1647,55189,1475,1060,11,449,927,264,7895,16779,13239,505,1521,72815,811,13,39168,287,420,25885,374,8104,6485,1606,420,6962,374,30547,11,54097,1752,11,323,12945,1752,13,2057,5813,7524,22972,11,433,374,1101,3062,311,3619,24559,1268,420,23490,53997,6962,22223,1057,47120,13,578,1176,4320,15812,304,1057,42631,17383,13,87669,430,584,37397,374,40460,1555,279,6680,311,264,13128,2663,856,94855,11,902,10756,323,8873,2142,24463,311,16124,39881,13,1628,430,596,1405,1057,75283,6962,31957,288,13,1102,513,4861,279,2035,315,24463,520,420,13128,11,87843,279,8312,315,24463,311,24569,323,1057,2547,649,912,5129,14201,5196,627,198,7816,24559,11,12782,1647,55189,58585,311,459,19670,7559,520,279,4219,315,279,13128,11,902,374,15609,304,279,9302,24442,757,13,1472,649,1518,420,13128,439,264,6485,99810,449,279,11212,19670,520,1202,4219,13,2057,4007,420,25885,315,11212,810,17693,11,433,374,3062,311,387,3025,311,38553,433,11,369,3187,389,264,6500,13,2057,656,420,11,584,1005,37072,4211,430,690,7664,279,16628,1990,279,12782,1647,55189,43030,323,279,13128,13,1226,1243,13383,430,279,6070,315,279,1
