Here's my attempt to translate and summarize it:\n\nThe speaker is discussing the journey of Ulysses, which represents a state of being that means \"man of pain\" or \"man of sorrow\". This theme is relevant to the current economic situation, as there are many obstacles facing those who are trying to navigate the economy. The speaker emphasizes the importance of social economy and its rapid evolution.\n\nMaresex will be focusing on the contribution of social economy in Europe, which means finding indicators that show how social prices affect the commercial environment. Without these indicators, it's difficult to find a solution.\n\nThe speaker then asks why social economy is important. He notes that recently, Australia and France signed an agreement to produce submarines that will create 100 jobs over 10 years. This is significant because if we consider that 20% of businesses are social enterprises, this could translate to a 40% reduction in taste for the final product. This represents a very competitive economy.\n\nThe speaker concludes by saying that they believe that with a strong social economy, using these indicators will help us understand the future and reconcile our understanding of economic trends.\n\nOverall, the transcript is discussing the challenges facing the economy and the importance of considering social factors when navigating economic obstacles.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,356,17771,514,45640,294,6,52,61492,325,11,4160,648,294,6,27887,68238,1744,4538,9859,1879,333,689,275,40351,409,25595,36077,11,3625,32116,7930,274,6,83336,306,77558,25400,1880,934,35329,8508,275,3625,7120,42138,3625,46106,13,19421,74699,326,31769,45317,648,75107,11,326,31769,65272,409,326,31769,45317,648,75107,11,272,17771,25945,3062,13,11876,18003,2191,288,409,326,31769,45317,648,75107,4046,12821,11942,25945,100198,1880,64898,11814,2700,2473,1208,19035,1765,326,31769,45317,648,75107,7010,326,6,31880,732,8458,76605,13510,1744,326,41901,2842,40280,294,6,2933,69572,88253,11,3900,308,17771,6502,7970,5019,3625,38847,12288,83391,1880,3625,38847,12288,83391,308,6,546,6502,48488,409,46681,5019,75831,653,50026,40280,8518,37849,13,356,8458,76605,13510,934,35329,308,17771,6502,3284,409,46524,1208,19035,13,64898,11814,2700,2473,1208,19035,409,326,31769,45317,648,75107,665,14240,41939,3625,20934,598,951,38847,1880,665,26483,77282,3625,13519,1759,5368,818,37291,27750,13519,1759,3073,306,11,4864,46524,2192,1208,19035,9465,3625,82653,552,65207,1880,3625,38847,13,19421,74699,11,87320,326,31769,45317,648,75107,30,7695,379,264,653,46415,11,3900,264,24560,1879,978,653,14902,9465,326,52374,5523,648,1880,1208,9822,13,356,8458,76605,13510,1208,59251,409,26725,3625,32592,71098,1354,7930,1022,8135,220,1041,8654,385,285,1765,220,605,65838,732,8458,76605,13510,28201,13,3489,17771,54312,7930,513,39904,30,38891,89,6316,82653,648,7930,31435,220,508,4,951,97263,65207,1880,45602,4790,21581,1339,7010,220,1272,4,6316,9517,23985,409,733,60768,7010,514,54206,1620,13,356,8458,76605,13510,6316,82653,648,25945,36897,1880,75332,3486,9833,1105,11,17317,23423,2439,1744,274,35329,379,264,6316,82653,648,75107,25945,36897,11,665,42587,519,27750,13519,1759,11,45602,17317,87885,1137,3869,326,6,5389,404,1880,3869,71751,6316,11376,9517,41546,4008,8047,951,7591,81,1924,82653,8467,1880,1131,272,17771,6502,1131,272,17771,10415,978,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,32,36815,304,8753,0,5810,596,856,4879,311,15025,323,63179,433,512,198,791,19114,374,25394,279,11879,315,549,398,784,288,11,902,11105,264,1614,315,1694,430,3445,330,1543,315,6784,1,477,330,1543,315,58596,3343,1115,7057,374,9959,311,279,1510,7100,6671,11,439,1070,527,1690,32116,13176,1884,889,527,4560,311,21546,279,8752,13,578,19114,66159,279,12939,315,3674,8752,323,1202,11295,15740,627,198,44,548,11814,690,387,21760,389,279,19035,315,3674,8752,304,4606,11,902,3445,9455,34824,430,1501,1268,3674,7729,7958,279,8518,4676,13,17586,1521,34824,11,433,596,5107,311,1505,264,6425,627,198,791,19114,1243,17501,3249,3674,8752,374,3062,13,1283,8554,430,6051,11,8494,323,9822,8667,459,9306,311,8356,86642,430,690,1893,220,1041,7032,927,220,605,1667,13,1115,374,5199,1606,422,584,2980,430,220,508,4,315,9873,527,3674,40919,11,420,1436,15025,311,264,220,1272,4,14278,304,12945,369,279,1620,2027,13,1115,11105,264,1633,15022,8752,627,198,791,19114,45537,555,5605,430,814,4510,430,449,264,3831,3674,8752,11,1701,1521,34824,690,1520,603,3619,279,3938,323,64508,1057,8830,315,7100,18845,627,198,28589,11,279,36815,374,25394,279,11774,13176,279,8752,323,279,12939,315,13126,3674,9547,994,60499,7100,32116,13,128009],"total_duration":8349352829,"load_duration":237857,"prompt_eval_count":394,"prompt_eval_duration":785611000,"eval_count":256,"eval_duration":7562997000}
