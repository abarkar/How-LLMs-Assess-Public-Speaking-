The speaker is discussing the comet's composition and significance, drawing parallels between its ancient impact on Earth and the emergence of life.\n\nSome interesting points I've highlighted:\n\n1. The comet's appearance is described as an intense \"cosmic hair\" that traverses space.\n2. Some people view comets as bad omens, predicting wars or the death of notable individuals.\n3. The speaker mentions Rosetta, a spacecraft that successfully orbited and landed on Comet 67P after a decade-long journey.\n4. The comet's composition is revealed to be a mix of ice and dust, with some negative rumors suggesting it's just a big ball of dirty snow (but the speaker thinks it's respectable).\n5. The comet has been observed approaching close to the sun at times, which is remarkable.\n6. Rosetta was able to collect and analyze particles from the comet's tail during its closest approach to the sun.\n7. The analysis results are somewhat ambiguous due to the age of the instrument used (developed 20 years ago).\n8. However, the speaker has a modern copy of the instrument on Earth and can use it to compare with similar materials from comets.\n9. By analyzing these particles, the speaker reveals that Comet 67P contains organic matter, which is essential for life's proliferation.\n10. The comet's impacts on ancient Earth are seen as crucial in the emergence of life.\n\nOverall, this text presents a captivating and scientific discussion about Comet 67P, highlighting its significance in understanding the origins of life on our planet.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,56744,72,3625,1343,98078,4558,4978,4046,376,5637,7930,459,3904,514,38900,64934,273,5455,11,503,41901,4635,2852,653,7930,75467,54008,67882,3625,5636,66079,9466,36306,13,445,53149,277,684,294,31109,19428,3091,899,554,56754,2428,44087,519,1880,30517,519,514,23895,29079,13,1708,1105,1744,76076,917,43711,12575,1208,5017,978,3930,57891,11,294,81979,9465,3415,1188,49733,409,25945,60014,100063,30179,1154,11,22299,326,6,1138,344,8047,409,1709,261,417,29340,75,15844,6033,1208,10237,294,6,484,592,417,97252,1154,13,11876,470,4558,2392,1218,8135,665,1156,48099,13,36684,67,986,1880,9622,46138,11,75804,88253,11,503,34155,326,39982,30052,324,1880,514,6223,321,73899,409,9189,30179,1992,220,3080,47,921,2303,283,31061,480,9431,27236,9509,13,34447,9465,17317,11,389,25692,326,53149,8023,220,3080,47,6033,27584,921,22185,5019,3625,528,1769,13,8560,75876,43765,11,84276,308,26248,6502,18757,23761,30179,6960,75804,88253,13,356,17771,87320,4864,91507,259,1992,409,2800,275,8977,514,5636,33204,4558,1001,3284,3846,934,80720,296,26248,15473,778,978,13,14465,27389,69,12339,9189,27389,43406,11,84276,308,17771,6502,25945,3869,326,6,4105,9952,3625,23672,288,13,5186,12416,294,953,8261,409,45640,11,29449,33204,51453,4538,451,16870,27625,11,29449,60630,8047,71269,20487,11,264,84788,72,3869,64290,404,6316,10877,13,1219,2727,9189,45366,514,46131,11,16233,31779,478,978,264,4287,978,409,17317,9517,52274,1565,514,76354,409,4538,272,89412,13,1252,296,19010,853,409,2840,580,1880,409,17258,784,20712,13,11876,60014,85,22626,8859,1157,5534,546,1744,220,3080,47,308,17771,934,31109,45371,30870,273,409,841,7404,6412,13,6178,72,11,4864,73953,8065,32150,556,934,80720,1826,62486,13,3341,665,5636,409,7364,1215,90053,3930,13612,321,11,27549,297,325,274,41901,3057,9211,1370,86633,294,22827,28800,21965,84364,13,19421,272,3433,10333,1474,6870,11,54613,308,26248,326,98279,4099,294,93825,653,40351,13,7508,818,841,66167,409,2840,580,3663,8065,18803,91080,3930,8574,84,6354,1286,321,13,2998,67781,11,3869,22267,99481,409,1208,3512,2381,978,11,84276,274,17771,4046,6583,1386,8047,1880,264,5945,544,69328,348,822,3516,479,951,52021,409,17258,784,20712,90053,294,80720,13,44564,33204,51453,4538,451,16870,27625,665,264,11626,978,5019,6667,261,1880,8678,805,27750,41936,409,17258,784,20712,1208,1056,5512,3869,326,6,370,11283,13,2009,80259,11,272,17771,1744,326,6,2295,652,10515,367,951,29060,308,17771,6502,4046,1325,6960,11,1841,84568,2605,72,89810,294,22827,14473,68866,978,3900,379,264,6316,348,76019,8511,294,6,1036,14014,13,1283,554,43765,13,622,34155,3869,7643,46096,1765,10335,265,6316,6293,648,98642,409,42067,14473,13,14465,94297,45575,326,49963,12329,5019,8678,805,951,86374,4298,2249,80664,4893,3869,66056,951,470,4558,2392,13,19421,93455,3625,100246,951,29060,9952,66056,951,17258,46756,31539,470,10515,17724,13,362,32384,11,1208,7809,57288,409,46681,757,29557,294,6,19010,1791,1814,3625,24511,3625,64972,22641,5512,409,16233,31779,478,978,13,445,6,26125,1208,5636,36897,11,272,17771,1744,44564,65473,2392,325,1421,51453,409,1208,5634,20712,2942,2428,13,39783,5634,20712,3869,2385,409,1841,20337,4043,23202,6853,3869,1208,29520,333,53301,409,1208,17536,13,2582,11,17317,11427,2439,1744,3625,470,4558,2392,14848,86562,978,1208,10335,265,28694,11,7591,34667,35534,28130,5634,20712,2942,2428,11,1880,28068,519,44351,653,436,57332,64284,7010,326,31769,1195,29355,3930,18434,519,13,1708,1105,1744,3625,6954,4918,9466,36306,951,470,4558,2392,77554,76743,1188,27750,12025,417,22299,3625,9622,11467,409,1208,10237,11,16233,31779,478,978,220,3080,47,296,26248,1089,324,978,8065,32150,556,1744,15907,46845,5615,45632,14848,24560,951,17210,1759,63846,17724,3869,1208,17536,11,15878,3625,447,2053,13080,9189,11,13080,41091,11,841,1446,919,30179,812,13,362,9832,77492,88253,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,27387,1495,4999,198,2181,8111,311,387,264,36815,315,264,15864,477,31678,922,99198,220,3080,47,14,1163,3431,372,869,12279,9431,27236,9509,320,19171,3967,439,921,22185,570,578,19114,374,25394,279,71086,596,18528,323,26431,11,13633,72474,1990,1202,14154,5536,389,9420,323,279,49179,315,2324,627,198,8538,7185,3585,358,3077,27463,512,198,16,13,578,71086,596,11341,374,7633,439,459,19428,330,9594,21914,7013,1,430,30517,288,3634,13,198,17,13,4427,1274,1684,470,1441,439,3958,8019,729,11,52997,25981,477,279,4648,315,28289,7931,13,198,18,13,578,19114,34945,16870,27625,11,264,42640,430,7946,37466,1639,323,27212,389,99198,220,3080,47,1306,264,13515,24725,11879,13,198,19,13,578,71086,596,18528,374,10675,311,387,264,6651,315,10054,323,16174,11,449,1063,8389,35492,23377,433,596,1120,264,2466,5041,315,19108,12056,320,8248,279,19114,15849,433,596,62486,570,198,20,13,578,71086,706,1027,13468,31047,3345,311,279,7160,520,3115,11,902,374,23649,13,198,21,13,16870,27625,574,3025,311,6667,323,24564,19252,505,279,71086,596,9986,2391,1202,18585,5603,311,279,7160,13,198,22,13,578,6492,3135,527,14738,55861,4245,31
