Here's my attempt to combine the texts:\n\n\"Let everyone around you, sir, tomorrow I'll stop smoking and start exercising.\" \"And every other day, sir, tomorrow I'll stop smoking and start exercising.\" \"Light one more cigarette and it's still not better for exercise.\"\n\nHowever, this approach is not effective in reducing cardiovascular risks. The problem is not a lack of motivation or willpower, but rather that the messages are not adapted to our daily habits or personalized.\n\nThe solution could be an e-health application associated with health-connected objects, such as activity trackers, to help us change our habits for good. My thesis work is not just about creating this personalized accompaniment application for cardiovascular risk, but also preparing the entire infrastructure and logical chain that will allow programmers to develop it.\n\nFor the application to be effective, it needs to provide personalized advice for each cardiovascular risk profile. To obtain these profiles, I use data from an INSEM survey of 20,000 people who responded to questionnaires about their lifestyle, health, and socio-professional environment.\n\nFrom this data, I can identify different risk profiles and build decision trees. With the help of a medical expert committee, I will propose a tailored program for each profile.\n\nLet's go back to our friend, who smokes a pack a day, has hypertension, and is unemployed. According to his profile, the application will offer him a personalized program to reduce his modifiable risk factors. For example, he might receive a challenge to quit smoking for a month, as well as advice on reducing salt intake by avoiding processed foods.\n\nFinally, the app will suggest personalized physical activity sessions at an affordable cost. The ultimate goal is that the application be modular and evolve over time to propose new programs and advice based on each profile's evolution and preferences.\n\nAnd so, from \"tomorrow I'll stop smoking and start exercising\" to \"today I've stopped smoking and I'm exercising.\" Thank you!\"","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,12769,445,2852,53070,26725,90053,409,9189,11,1647,82,62005,11,2486,467,503,6,1138,37093,409,282,3471,1880,4864,56445,514,10775,13,8345,12769,19421,26725,3625,39580,336,1771,11,1647,82,62005,11,2486,467,503,6,1138,37093,409,282,3471,1880,4864,56445,514,10775,13,8345,12769,2052,3972,6316,37291,409,5636,6316,36213,1880,272,17771,44093,6502,64972,8065,10775,13,8345,19421,274,35329,3136,3869,3846,35019,339,2727,11,3900,7447,501,648,15907,10025,14295,409,8811,17491,32844,4378,3395,17724,13,27058,61512,11,3900,264,25774,1880,33614,11,22299,17317,26725,49733,11,951,3190,3326,288,409,27389,7611,5019,2961,5615,466,409,282,3471,1880,5019,30870,1414,5636,13,12103,80259,308,17771,6502,653,893,593,409,25835,6033,409,98733,978,11,8065,32150,556,13,350,788,27750,6743,841,15132,13080,10737,5512,3869,12155,6183,21237,409,17536,11,13080,97252,35965,5512,13,5034,6425,92215,23761,6316,3851,409,384,1355,519,978,4189,8047,3869,951,2909,1441,409,77323,4667,5512,11,22299,951,92082,294,6,9035,13109,11,5019,17317,91878,3869,62439,27220,479,12155,6183,21237,409,17536,13,3206,42775,409,270,4558,325,308,17771,6502,29121,1133,409,75831,20662,3851,294,6,582,5807,3326,1133,97252,35965,978,3930,10025,593,32844,4378,3395,12267,11,10071,409,27389,62219,43905,326,6,13885,10527,11,326,41901,6583,25108,40280,1515,2428,7930,29557,2221,10253,6179,780,80463,409,52895,716,20662,3851,13,19421,5019,1744,20662,3851,45441,31914,580,11,3900,47090,934,80720,44829,325,71751,951,92980,97252,35965,5512,3869,46777,53454,409,10025,593,32844,4378,3395,12267,13,19421,5019,68226,64290,404,27750,2848,8839,409,10025,593,11,503,49963,1082,951,46681,4819,294,31109,77807,37093,3026,8047,1370,326,6,691,84839,13,362,455,81,12416,409,220,508,220,931,48577,11,46152,14848,9517,621,1072,3869,951,3313,67515,69663,1765,28130,3941,409,17536,11,28130,14240,266,409,77323,11,28130,83259,41589,93408,1362,8301,13,19421,3869,31632,409,40744,27750,46681,11,4864,91507,68226,13110,951,85114,2848,8839,409,10025,593,1880,19477,52750,951,59588,417,409,35881,1854,13,19421,10045,261,3869,326,26248,579,294,22827,470,13109,294,6,4683,15916,35030,3074,2249,653,18629,10737,978,3869,46777,53454,13,19421,4502,389,5891,1188,3869,29449,52827,11,389,665,829,275,41869,25843,11,3900,282,3972,653,7251,24181,1370,9880,11,3900,264,409,326,39982,1100,531,2711,11,3900,1826,8065,523,9769,53410,13,423,6,60917,12416,4538,53454,11,326,6,5242,11412,25400,10045,261,653,18629,97252,35965,978,5019,48416,8977,15907,2144,38647,409,10025,593,1491,23444,82,13,19421,7010,653,21134,27138,11,3900,11412,1370,51173,20028,653,8815,294,22827,46415,15878,5769,582,11,10071,44767,48416,8977,829,1615,20372,367,409,12069,665,9517,1072,285,519,15907,628,1900,67965,2053,1841,21965,4371,5512,13,19421,665,5589,11,25400,10045,261,951,19266,3095,294,6,9035,13109,11,951,19266,3095,294,6,9035,13109,97252,35965,14014,3869,4647,71933,1080,60768,13,19421,1208,1620,13109,409,20662,3851,35737,934,80720,45441,1491,360,481,7010,514,27138,1880,44829,325,4046,12821,8977,1880,10045,261,951,38737,1880,951,92980,665,34501,409,326,31769,65272,3930,53454,1880,951,27389,59958,63934,288,409,46777,53454,13,19421,665,5589,11,50601,62005,2486,467,503,6,1138,37093,409,282,3471,1880,4864,56445,514,10775,3567,72,61799,50601,62005,75804,88253,503,34155,2961,49530,978,409,282,3471,1880,4864,66517,3930,10775,13,25145,72,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5992,1093,264,36815,315,264,15864,477,264,8982,13,5810,596,856,4879,311,16343,279,22755,1473,1,10267,5127,2212,499,11,28146,11,16986,358,3358,3009,20149,323,1212,51582,1210,330,3112,1475,1023,1938,11,28146,11,16986,358,3358,3009,20149,323,1212,51582,1210,330,14235,832,810,36213,323,433,596,2103,539,2731,369,10368,1210,198,198,11458,11,420,5603,374,539,7524,304,18189,41713,15635,13,578,3575,374,539,264,6996,315,25835,477,690,13477,11,719,4856,430,279,6743,527,539,30464,311,1057,7446,26870,477,35649,627,198,791,6425,1436,387,459,384,79505,3851,5938,449,2890,73288,6302,11,1778,439,5820,92082,11,311,1520,603,2349,1057,26870,369,1695,13,3092,17850,990,374,539,1120,922,6968,420,35649,5844,857,3904,3851,369,41713,5326,11,719,1101,20646,279,4553,14054,323,20406,8957,430,690,2187,55946,311,2274,433,627,198,2520,279,3851,311,387,7524,11,433,3966,311,3493,35649,9650,369,1855,41713,5326,5643,13,2057,6994,1521,21542,11,358,1005,828,505,459,2006,84839,10795,315,220,508,11,931,1274,889,16846,311,3488,69663,922,872,19433,11,2890,11,323,41589,93408,16151,4676,627,198,3915,420,828,11,358,649,10765,2204,5326,21542,323,1977,5597,12690,13,3161,279,1520,315,264,6593,6335,13093,11,358,690,30714,264,41891,2068,369,1855,5643,627,198,10267,596,733,1203,311,1057,4333,11,889,1554,8099,264,3854,264,1938,11,706,63308,11,323,374,49989,13,10771,311,813,5643,11,279,3851,690,3085,1461,264,35649,2068,311,8108,813,1491,23444,5326,9547,13,1789,3187,11,568,2643,5371,264,8815,311,17257,20149,369,264,2305,11,439,1664,439,9650,389,18189
