The presenter is discussing how some starlings may be born with an \"silver spoon\" (metaphor for being born with advantages) in their beak, which is equivalent to being part of a wealthy family that sets them up for success. However, the presenter is focusing on the opposite scenario: what happens when starlings are not given these advantages and instead face stress and adversity early in life.\n\nThe researcher has conducted an experiment where two groups of young starlings were raised under different conditions. One group received insects with a hormone that mimics stress (corticost√©rone), while the other group received normal insects without the hormone. The presenter is discussing how they measured the attractiveness of the male starlings, as well as their parenting abilities, by looking at factors such as barbe length and number of offspring produced.\n\nThe results suggest that the starlings who did not receive the \"silver spoon\" treatment (i.e., those raised under stressful conditions) had smaller barbes, which made them less attractive to females. However, when they did manage to mate, they produced larger and more numerous offspring than their peers with longer barbes. This challenges the idea that having a \"silver spoon\" is necessary for reproductive success.\n\nOverall, the presentation seems to be arguing that early life experiences can have lasting impacts on an individual's development and abilities, and that some starlings may thrive even without being given advantages from birth.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,10467,89,45325,3846,1744,1879,57609,326,6,29199,12769,4415,66014,9952,6316,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,7010,1208,30870,1557,8345,949,46408,97583,265,514,20272,934,22827,23496,84,11,53066,294,31109,67628,436,12333,11,40142,16968,3846,934,35329,25400,47090,5019,59394,653,7970,76235,7010,1208,17536,13,7695,35737,15878,85624,294,2182,653,56430,72006,11,6800,11,12108,11,10071,76776,665,7245,483,77323,13,13789,11,10071,26077,1826,514,55520,9465,20662,87810,409,7015,484,12339,1880,3625,4647,483,12249,74522,8467,949,61651,14707,272,17771,16968,326,41901,3841,84,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,7591,23827,261,4502,11,46206,3625,4647,483,12249,28463,11,76076,23496,355,56311,4415,66014,9952,6316,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,7010,514,106508,13,1708,1105,11,4068,25692,10539,7591,5589,404,6316,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,5019,653,17258,784,258,409,4647,483,2933,949,27058,653,17258,784,258,11,272,17771,951,6699,6666,77,5512,7930,73661,79738,653,1689,991,16491,5019,20028,28130,72039,3869,326,6,370,462,951,27389,1045,1759,13,34447,272,17771,28463,653,72006,13612,321,11,653,39646,436,12333,665,27080,288,1880,951,100164,1354,6502,21965,1437,4168,1821,13,445,1105,593,326,22827,409,27750,33013,98942,1826,893,31548,11,1370,51173,11,1208,5103,6853,308,17771,6502,35597,13254,409,4538,39646,11,1880,514,8811,1826,21965,10366,978,3869,19266,1072,556,294,81979,5103,37907,11,3625,17258,784,1354,15132,1208,1056,5512,513,14630,8065,72039,11,3869,1208,16888,72,951,27389,1045,1759,1880,3611,309,5512,13,19421,45602,2605,61652,653,8631,46206,3625,17258,784,1354,13,19421,514,8631,11,9189,665,5804,72,408,23577,11,3846,308,17771,6502,25945,7970,5019,1208,77323,13,622,57286,664,648,39587,5636,51625,285,42625,4068,3846,8631,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,20662,19821,409,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,11,85434,3869,1208,77323,951,17258,784,1354,13,27058,45602,11,17317,57038,4046,3532,978,951,17258,784,1354,409,4647,483,12249,13,81245,14848,24560,9517,4581,285,665,26633,1912,288,12742,82,13,11876,17258,784,1354,3930,21134,57951,14848,312,79884,10878,519,28130,14425,24918,951,45555,2396,294,52152,9885,288,15921,14014,9952,6316,36908,409,8631,25945,9517,79,438,361,46206,3625,297,1082,12249,11,1208,23100,292,537,14081,606,13,356,8458,264,14175,285,294,6,19729,479,261,28130,53052,409,8631,11,14843,285,519,44351,3846,7930,513,39904,5019,653,17258,784,258,4046,3532,978,15878,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,13,11876,17258,784,1354,3930,2132,57951,14848,10484,3869,84440,312,79884,951,45555,2396,294,52152,9885,288,7138,13,81245,14848,39587,24560,4046,3532,5512,7010,951,4787,887,978,3916,11,15878,8631,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,9952,6316,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,7010,514,106508,13,39783,37291,409,1055,355,88025,11,503,34155,14240,21178,978,4068,514,20272,294,49152,13603,24560,47371,3372,285,5512,6033,2536,10878,519,28130,14425,24918,28068,1339,1765,28130,9504,344,13109,1877,31037,1880,28130,23878,13109,3869,409,43406,409,82134,6699,13,1708,1105,11,4068,20272,10539,5019,47929,4502,653,4647,483,2933,1826,72006,342,437,325,949,432,3675,409,5636,4382,13,11876,296,9011,645,4647,483,12249,57485,306,6316,3703,1395,13,19421,11,22299,46206,3625,2854,1771,11,3625,3703,10551,15132,77554,14081,5512,22299,3625,5636,11124,13,622,34155,39587,11083,324,978,1208,1317,79623,409,27750,3703,9620,1880,503,34155,5363,978,7930,951,4647,483,12249,409,12155,26633,1912,288,50590,3625,5636,38546,13,27058,4046,838,8977,3625,20697,21237,2748,3916,951,4647,483,12249,11,503,34155,42587,978,951,12823,409,71132,13,622,34155,55056,978,514,13026,409,86696,934,85217,2558,10994,1188,10878,519,6316,76132,11,44351,1744,1208,62827,1880,514,97418,409,15907,17258,784,1354,13,19421,8065,1620,11,934,17771,54312,1744,39043,264,33537,978,949,622,34155,9466,978,1744,3625,4647,483,12249,7930,308,6,2979,1188,6502,312,79884,409,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,7010,514,106508,10878,519,28130,14425,24918,84764,1188,951,3703,9620,5636,98385,11,39587,46152,97958,40970,11124,1744,43153,1391,31539,13,27058,61512,11,1880,272,17771,39015,653,65285,266,25945,92759,519,11,8811,90966,514,20272,934,85217,264,1188,40970,409,17393,409,2605,78,16339,653,16081,409,272,89412,46206,6316,5103,6853,11,87158,66090,63484,513,54206,11,46152,14848,6316,3703,1395,5636,38920,1744,28130,1391,12339,13,19421,665,5636,11,46152,82133,2558,556,951,17258,784,1354,5636,25500,1880,665,5636,6800,13026,1744,43153,1391,1590,288,13,362,32384,11,6502,63669,409,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,5019,409,43406,653,7970,312,3107,12844,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5084,1093,499,617,264,36815,315,264,3495,15864,477,17850,9232,922,279,5536,315,4216,2324,11704,389,279,4500,323,49058,18000,315,13018,660,6917,19342,320,64,955,315,12224,570,578,34756,374,25394,1268,1063,6917,19342,1253,387,9405,449,459,330,83014,46605,1,320,4150,1366,269,369,1694,9405,449,22934,8,304,872,387,587,11,902,374,13890,311,1694,961,315,264,28994,3070,430,7437,1124,709,369,2450,13,4452,1
