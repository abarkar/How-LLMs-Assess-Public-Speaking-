Tomorrow, computer technology will do it quickly and accurately. What's the advantage? We'll know the car number before the drawing! That's what I'll explain later. First, let me talk about aerospace security. In aviation domains, we can study an airplane's history just after landing, but not quickly enough to predict whether its next flight will be risky or not. Let me explain better. An airliner has over 6,000 sensors that record a lot of information about all its components. For example, after just one hour of flight, we'll have over 2 billion data points! We're looking for billions of numbers recorded. If we look at these data, it's like facing an enormous library with countless books to read and analyze. In these billions of data points, we're searching only for those that can be linked to abnormal behaviors. For example, a sudden temperature or pressure change that tells us a component is damaged. The search for these abnormal behaviors is important. The search for these behaviors in such vast amounts of data isn't currently possible before the plane can take off again. But no panic, dear public! That's where I come in. One of my thesis goals is to develop rapid analysis techniques. To do this, I'm inspired by a simple and effective idea: an index. You know what an index is from school. It allows us to quickly find information without needing to read the entire book. I use the same principle! I've reduced the amount of data analyzed to quickly find the information that interests us. So, I started by developing techniques, mathematical models that allowed me... (gets interrupted) Ah, excuse me. That's my thesis in a nutshell!\n\nPlease note that this is not an official translation and may contain errors or
