The journalist is reporting live from Fontainebleau and is having trouble finding anything to say about the forest's condition. They mention that scientists are also struggling to determine whether a forest is healthy or not, as it's not just about the absence of degradation, but also about understanding how the forest functions ecologically.\n\nThe journalist goes on to explain that they have been studying forest ecosystems and biodiversity with their colleagues for 10 years, trying to build indicators to track the ecological state of forests. They mention specific questions they are trying to answer, such as what size area a forest needs to develop optimally or how much dead wood is needed to enrich soils.\n\nThe journalist then reveals that they have been working on a thesis and have analyzed thousands of plant surveys over a century, which has allowed them to identify changes in ecosystems due to climate change. They highlight that 11% of mountainous ecosystem forests have already shifted towards warmer climates, which is a significant change.\n\nThe journalist also mentions other threats to forest ecosystems, such as soil compaction and invasive exotic species. They mention that Europe has set objectives and provided funding for forest conservation efforts since the 1990s, but wonder if these efforts are effective in protecting forests and biodiversity.\n\nThe final question the journalist poses is whether public policies promoting biodiversity are sufficient to achieve their goals. To answer this, they plan to compare protected forests with those that are not, as the ultimate goal is not just to know how forests are doing, but also to ensure they remain in a healthy state.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,3436,30854,36731,665,2167,409,9757,8511,901,2933,60630,978,76305,5019,97166,326,57286,266,409,20662,369,49530,13,1708,1105,12155,369,5615,2641,42437,22626,82133,84568,14707,13,29124,66,2182,89,11,4864,100164,409,1208,296,46651,11,951,35641,625,2439,11,951,23962,11,951,82711,31355,11,16968,39043,296,6,326,6,1334,294,6,14283,6502,21965,8811,43584,62408,8486,17194,841,829,275,6502,75249,13510,13,356,17771,4725,5019,326,52152,4811,13,11876,7330,333,8467,14848,48488,409,8811,3869,47929,4502,6316,369,49530,11412,14707,6033,6502,13,81245,11427,306,665,48901,4046,838,8977,3625,3026,2492,7930,281,12416,306,1765,27549,1880,3625,7591,70,9011,2641,1744,45602,25692,20028,1345,2852,1370,45973,11,5019,68226,13510,1744,16968,11412,14707,11,326,6,3518,768,409,7591,49241,841,8657,275,6502,13,356,17771,87320,4864,5320,2249,60946,265,4068,1208,369,49530,34501,818,5019,4046,838,8977,4538,14240,266,294,22827,1486,409,48234,91329,1640,2428,13,34447,514,80259,11,272,17771,934,54386,841,25692,6502,25400,7631,261,11,45575,4068,1744,272,17771,3846,5634,258,30,74656,6033,14707,1208,67628,11,3625,92622,66304,11,3625,9259,13,19421,5019,61512,39043,20272,220,605,8261,1744,503,6,2706,81356,14707,25400,1153,261,1208,3488,13,13789,11,4864,841,36731,39040,339,4558,325,41199,16968,3846,27138,11,10071,41199,220,605,8261,11,9952,11083,4631,4558,70,1157,11,17317,14240,664,919,3625,4046,9594,599,66474,13952,4918,1880,28130,56594,1986,13109,5019,19477,52750,951,13519,1759,409,924,33920,409,28130,14240,266,91329,1640,2428,13,1952,513,62163,11,1370,51173,11,409,74940,7479,6316,369,49530,264,63669,5019,513,52895,716,409,85722,7706,1604,6033,35597,1208,10484,13109,409,66304,10237,100243,5019,2018,8977,3869,31518,404,3625,2092,82,13,34447,3663,8065,893,593,409,390,46302,11,3900,379,264,45889,65838,11,389,274,17771,259,3514,978,5553,1208,38317,13,4418,66,11,9952,514,65827,3675,409,1647,4046,61673,11,503,34155,59062,978,6316,270,4558,325,7010,1208,88265,4864,757,17477,26633,4860,13,5034,55133,3613,68495,514,9517,6583,1386,1133,11323,266,2428,13,11876,7330,333,8467,14848,7591,1677,376,978,4538,5536,1765,3625,6136,288,11,10071,389,893,593,35597,409,100246,1765,3625,4046,9594,599,66474,13,622,34155,39587,24560,23008,9211,951,2606,4918,409,79415,5512,409,6136,288,86595,5512,1765,5636,294,22827,97739,9326,1880,4864,3625,16796,51010,28111,5512,7010,6316,25945,25626,2385,409,46681,13,622,41901,16796,7591,47348,3625,4595,409,369,5615,2641,7010,3625,447,2053,46152,84764,1188,24560,86595,5512,13,19421,503,34155,18757,48021,665,4046,28580,1744,46939,665,20605,24812,11,220,806,1034,951,4046,9594,599,66474,13952,4918,14848,4046,12821,96559,5553,951,7625,53819,5636,70412,82,934,49152,519,13,220,806,4,272,17771,653,30870,273,4550,479,46939,77554,14081,481,13,19421,1370,543,4558,1001,3869,39043,11,294,81979,3026,2492,84764,1188,24560,3608,13215,14014,41199,1317,67380,11,22299,1370,51173,514,259,13559,479,951,2092,82,6033,35597,3625,16948,4558,1634,506,354,8467,6233,1494,1056,15844,13,356,17771,87320,11,41199,3625,65838,220,1954,11,326,48968,4176,17317,21559,951,1665,22589,1880,3625,52138,729,294,6,351,404,13,11876,13952,4918,2322,73468,39587,665,2035,951,6299,1765,514,25911,5019,1760,978,1414,1208,369,49530,1880,829,56594,1986,13109,13,34447,1913,54960,11,1826,54312,1744,39043,15572,68,39043,30,356,17771,1208,26633,90272,3488,1744,4864,757,17477,13,9589,54312,1744,3625,3435,8467,78511,14295,665,282,525,324,409,1208,17332,11159,13109,15132,31914,2492,30,9589,54312,1744,12155,9045,15132,8657,285,1821,30,27058,39043,4864,91507,93455,3625,369,5615,2641,7930,15132,1760,19395,14014,9952,19637,645,7930,514,15132,1069,21719,11,66021,1744,11,8065,1620,11,29449,1665,333,308,17771,6502,71357,409,47929,4068,82133,3625,369,5615,2641,13,19421,39043,11,39043,308,17771,934,31109,14240,2070,13,5034,1620,13109,11,272,17771,934,6,37907,779,1188,665,7970,14240,266,13,14465,15119,1557,3930,66304,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5992,1093,499,617,264,36815,315,264,23672,596,1934,389,279,1614,315,36658,304,9822,13,578,23672,374,13122,3974,505,9757,8511,901,2933,323,374,3515,12544,9455,4205,311,2019,922,279,13952,596,3044,13,2435,6420,430,14248,527,1101,20558,311,8417,3508,264,13952,374,9498,477,539,11,439,433,596,539,1120,922,279,19821,315,53568,11,719,1101,922,8830,1268,279,13952,5865,12208,30450,627,198,791,23672,5900,389,311,10552,430,814,617,1027,21630,13952,61951,323,73119,449,872,18105,369,220,605,1667,11,4560,311,1977,34824,311,3839,279,50953,1614,315,36658,13,2435,6420,3230,4860,814,527,4560,311,4320,11,1778,439,1148,1404,3158,264,13952,3966,311,2274,7706,750,477,1268,1790,5710,7732,374,4460,311,31518,69561,627,198,791,23672,1243,21667,430,814,617,1027,3318,389,264,17850,323,617,30239,9214,315,6136,32313,927,264,9478,11,902,706,5535,1124,311,10765,4442,304,61951,4245,311,10182,2349,13,2435,11415,430,220,806,4,315,16700,788,26031,36658,617,2736,30073,7119,46039,92399,11,9
