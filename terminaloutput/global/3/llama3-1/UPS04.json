This has always fascinated me to see him fix vehicles in two or three tries. Today, part of his knowledge has been automated. Cars self-diagnose. We're even preparing to make them fully autonomous. Or the only instruction we'll have to give them will be our destination. It's possible that we'll be the last generation to know how to drive. Or at least some of us will still hold a driver's license. You should know that a car is a connected object, like your phone. Therefore, it can be a target for attack or virus. And if, in today's cyber security context, connected objects are worn on our bodies, tomorrow, we'll be carried by these objects. And attacks can harm us and our surroundings. Don't worry, that's where my thesis comes in. How do you teach a car? How does it self-defend? A car has multiple objects: computer, electronics, and sensors that allow it to visualize, analyze, and make decisions. My job is to set up algorithms and mathematical models to build an artificial intelligence that simulates the immune system of an autonomous car. Like our immune system, its role is to ensure that our objects don't malfunction. And defend its body against any malicious intrusion. In immune systems, there are two types: innate, which reacts quickly but can't face new aggressors; and acquired or adaptive, as it's capable of learning about its enemy. My artificial intelligence takes inspiration from the second type. Because my interest is to detect new attacks and viruses. To counter the persistence of our objects. And defend its body against any malicious intrusion. And counter the persistence and creativity of hackers. And for this, my artificial intelligence, regulated by my algorithms, monitors all communications between the car's various components. Trying to learn a signature, a fingerprint that identifies normal behavior. And if at some point, the car's system state is consistent with the signature, then any decision made will be legitimate. And in case of an anomaly, it will trigger security systems to prevent intrusion. Technology has always brought comfort and safety to humanity. Ensuring that artificial intelligence protects us from human foolishness. If one day my father is in an autonomous car, and his capot breaks down, he won't have to open the hood.

you.\"","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,3206,281,12339,1826,32118,4919,3457,268,13,356,8458,296,26248,44093,15550,258,978,409,514,46131,665,26633,6033,56321,1437,4042,645,1323,7211,265,665,15572,68,3625,45165,83613,2482,13,362,9832,77492,88253,11,6316,48901,409,4538,47929,1826,5113,3689,8047,13,11876,4160,42204,274,49455,31559,8372,5118,306,13,1952,274,6,391,652,37093,27584,3869,3625,98054,4684,4558,79507,95103,288,13,69327,1208,86806,7754,1744,17317,44521,2439,3869,28130,71751,11,272,17771,29449,9284,13,7695,513,25692,934,54386,45441,1208,88818,46680,2214,39723,326,54386,274,1815,76069,556,13,2998,5589,11,5019,76076,11,3625,36852,4918,3869,2278,978,1126,653,14175,285,13,7695,47090,47929,934,31109,81645,11,272,17771,653,31260,4667,978,11,22299,29449,100007,13,4418,66,11,3900,25692,23761,272,1260,294,6,1617,20234,6033,409,17188,13,19421,4502,11,7010,29449,2317,68,409,9693,1941,978,2407,13109,75804,88253,11,3625,2909,1441,4667,5512,11,389,3625,60172,1765,17317,11,2486,467,11,272,17771,17317,7930,682,2439,23761,2700,5512,1370,27750,2909,1441,13,19421,3625,1651,64,14295,56311,17317,11148,556,1880,11148,556,3869,29449,1218,61140,13,14465,9189,436,395,554,11,272,17771,39015,39723,86953,1188,7643,270,4558,325,13,12535,20028,917,9484,265,3869,6316,81645,949,12535,274,6,3989,1773,121597,408,265,949,39783,81645,2278,4558,451,51854,2909,1441,13,31137,3357,324,11,4046,70329,2428,1880,28463,951,2107,668,1759,7930,82133,25400,29557,10367,409,9302,12329,11,8678,805,1880,59394,951,35881,6948,13,6178,72,11,1647,42775,6824,68,3869,48021,665,2035,951,12384,288,1880,951,1491,85798,7033,978,8637,8467,5019,19477,52750,6316,11478,1989,1104,72,6853,7930,11412,1675,8646,514,72601,4998,3928,12267,294,31109,81645,3154,263,638,13,1219,2727,29449,72601,4998,3928,12267,11,4538,436,57332,1826,409,20028,665,80444,1744,12155,2909,1441,841,513,7591,583,75,306,6502,13,19421,409,47371,408,265,4538,2942,44618,45973,43905,76220,294,52152,376,7713,8811,588,484,5048,13,46706,3625,42345,66474,4998,3928,17724,11,389,264,26633,4595,13,39783,294,635,6301,8047,11,7930,9517,74972,100198,11,10071,58271,409,20028,3663,3869,951,945,22550,1759,87325,13,19421,6316,294,635,19830,1082,6033,10737,1413,11,1841,27549,1826,13171,294,53149,9484,265,3869,74282,66014,64972,4538,61624,22530,13,6178,72,11,1647,11478,1989,1104,72,6853,11,27549,274,6,1354,23772,3930,26633,90272,955,13,3341,1647,528,14081,49530,1826,409,85877,440,261,409,80080,1651,64,14295,1880,409,87325,17188,13,27058,20028,3663,3869,326,6,613,1923,1133,409,12155,2909,1441,13,19421,409,47371,408,265,4538,2942,44618,45973,43905,76220,294,52152,376,7713,8811,588,484,5048,13,19421,409,47371,408,265,4538,2942,44618,45973,43905,76220,294,52152,376,7713,8811,588,484,5048,13,19421,409,47371,408,265,4538,2942,44618,45973,43905,76220,294,52152,376,7713,8811,588,484,5048,13,362,326,6,613,1923,1133,1880,3869,1208,34280,20053,13109,951,41467,13,19421,5019,3846,20028,11,326,55624,8677,1989,1104,72,6853,11,7930,1826,9517,22235,1370,11083,12384,288,11,15765,4618,40744,3625,17320,9465,3625,85114,40321,1821,409,1208,81645,13,27058,4043,1155,294,53149,9484,265,6316,12223,11,653,12541,294,6,37939,46429,11,7930,3608,57609,514,52962,1133,4725,3930,45165,83613,1130,13,19421,4502,3869,653,4545,11,326,57286,266,3930,72601,409,1208,81645,1826,98642,3869,1208,12223,11,39587,43905,35881,1854,7930,11412,23761,85424,1826,63828,13178,547,13,19421,7010,514,4865,32150,556,11,4502,326,57286,266,7591,64519,11,409,1208,12223,11,3900,379,40142,6316,70673,648,13,19421,39015,11,326,55624,8677,1989,1104,72,6853,11412,7591,566,268,9211,951,42345,66474,409,77463,13,27058,8654,5615,9211,43905,76220,294,52152,376,7713,13,5034,2869,38469,264,44093,1469,403,978,67009,1880,77463,3869,326,93825,2854,467,13,435,2852,519,665,80444,1744,326,55624,8677,1989,1104,72,6853,17317,1760,73899,409,1208,293,49530,1082,2854,8511,13,19421,4502,653,9880,11,1647,281,12339,1826,7010,6316,81645,3154,263,638,11,1880,829,2107,1295,11,3900,308,6,4202,1339,6502,3869,6033,63346,514,2107,354,13,25145,72,13,25145,72,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,8586,374,279,6498,14807,315,279,1495,1473,46240,7126,374,264,45239,13,1115,706,2744,61914,757,311,1518,1461,5155,11731,304,1403,477,2380,16696,13,11450,11,961,315,813,6677,706,1027,28598,13,36231,659,51389,3326,974,13,1226,2351,1524,20646,311,1304,1124,7373,39293,13,2582,279,1193,7754,584,3358,617,311,3041,1124,690,387,1057,9284,13,1102,596,3284,430,584,3358,387,279,1566,9659,311,1440,1268,311,6678,13,2582,520,3325,1063,315,603,690,2103,3412,264,5696,596,5842,13,1472,1288,1440,430,264,1841,374,264,8599,1665,11,1093,701,4641,13,15636,11,433,649,387,264,2218,369,3440,477,17188,13,1628,422,11,304,3432,596,21516,4868,2317,11,8599,6302,527,24634,389,1057,13162,11,16986,11,584,3358,387,11953,555,1521,6302,13,1628,8951,649,11682,603,323,1057,40190,13,4418,956,11196,11,430,596,1405,856,17850,4131,304,13,2650,656,499,4639,264,1841,30,2650,1587,433,659,29899,408,30
