Beyond the somewhat evasive answer parents give their children, we really wonder how, from a fertilized egg cell, we can create entire organisms like you and me. What interests me particularly during embryonic development is neurons, cells that transmit information. How do they position themselves in the right place in the organism and connect correctly with each other to form functional circuits? These questions have already been well studied from a chemical perspective, with the discovery of molecules that guide neurons, but the novelty of my project is to look at the role of mechanical forces in setting up neural circuits. To do this, I use the zebrafish model, as you can see here on the left, with images taken either facing or sideways. These images were taken about a day after spawning and by zooming in on the embryo's head with a microscope, like the image at center, we can see the brain developing, with eyes forming to the sides and above, the future nostrils of the fish. In the fish's nostril, neurons migrate away from the surface of the brain, stretching out behind them a long arm called an axon, by which they connect with cells in the brain. This is the image you can see on the right. Neurons, like other cells, have intrinsic mechanisms that allow them to migrate and move through their environment. In the case of neurons from the nostril, surprise, even when these intrinsic mechanisms don't work, neurons advance and extend their axon to connect with the brain. It's a bit like watching a car on a flat road, whose engine is broken but still moving forward. You might think about two hypotheses: either there are people who have brain problems or there are people pushing the car or pulling it. The same thing happens for neurons in the nostril. We think that cells from the eye, which are located below, pull the neurons of the nostril to the side, leading to the stretching out of their axon and connection with the brain. To verify this idea, I looked at embryos with a genetic mutation that don't form eyes. I saw that on these embryos, the neurons from the nostril don't advance either. These results come to confirm our hypothesis: according to which, the neurons in the nostril are more or less identical and therefore don't function. This is a method by which cells of the eye pull the neurons of the nostril, showing that there isn't just chemical molecules that are important during development but also mechanical forces. Beyond the nostril of the zebrafish, better understanding the role of mechanical forces during development will bring new light to diseases of the nervous system. So let force be with your neurons!","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,46706,1647,9511,67763,11,389,513,17477,6316,3488,79380,4382,11,1880,1744,9189,47592,78705,55755,46939,1153,8047,11,7930,1826,11,4068,389,20272,3625,90551,65,5512,949,33150,48226,6496,409,1208,90509,653,28800,4046,78134,1744,3625,6699,3381,3869,43153,60404,11,17317,389,513,62163,60019,11,4068,11,3869,31632,294,31109,2849,1130,69483,1739,58482,1321,8047,11,389,17782,3869,20028,951,47120,288,1218,4918,11,259,2053,1744,9189,1880,41091,13,24703,7930,296,55624,978,22550,5636,54008,67882,8065,45369,3930,82620,44481,13767,556,11,3846,15132,3625,21850,3233,11,3625,2849,2482,7930,1380,4150,73468,326,6,26125,13,12535,513,2361,77,306,12,8839,8065,7970,842,69596,7010,326,6,8629,44618,11,1880,513,4667,306,12,8839,4495,1133,3625,7120,9952,3625,46106,11,5019,4846,951,46121,34501,36527,949,62463,4860,14848,46939,24560,14707,14240,21178,14014,294,22827,1486,409,48234,38094,2428,11,9952,1208,35881,15170,668,409,22337,20243,2482,7930,1709,1748,3625,21850,3233,11,10071,1208,77701,94943,409,1647,46494,1826,409,5363,261,514,436,57332,951,8603,32118,4919,8467,7010,1208,57459,665,2035,951,46121,21850,6863,2249,13,27058,45602,11,503,49963,1082,514,83597,3930,3273,49363,1167,4558,21152,11,22299,9189,45366,514,46131,49733,3869,96721,11,9952,951,5448,550,5014,11,45441,409,3663,11,45441,1765,514,81337,13,62463,5448,14848,24560,550,5014,3869,50026,653,9880,42138,1208,37194,68,11,1880,665,15932,519,1765,1208,83067,409,326,6,9034,894,263,11,9952,514,73757,11,22299,1765,326,78337,8065,12541,11,389,25692,46131,514,272,5976,2933,7930,513,52895,375,11,9952,409,46777,81337,3625,20043,2249,7930,513,369,479,11,1880,8065,89429,355,11,3625,37923,44669,1572,3930,3273,49363,13,46706,1208,44669,483,3930,3273,49363,1167,4558,21152,11,3625,21850,3233,29444,8135,665,274,31769,385,59110,409,1208,7479,3930,272,5976,2933,11,16968,665,682,647,68,519,2761,65220,84440,653,1317,46496,11,326,6,710,606,11,77433,8065,43014,46152,513,4667,306,9952,3625,2849,2482,3930,272,5976,2933,13,356,17771,326,78337,934,54386,25692,46131,3869,7118,635,13,11876,21850,3233,11,16968,22299,3625,46106,2849,2482,11,14848,951,32118,4919,2191,288,10805,1354,4558,14295,7930,28130,29557,73468,409,9971,261,1880,294,49152,11967,7010,28130,50026,40280,13,46706,514,4865,951,21850,3233,409,1208,44669,483,11,13051,11,27584,87158,27750,32118,4919,2191,288,10805,1354,4558,14295,841,34501,77,306,6502,11,3625,21850,3233,1860,1149,306,1880,14240,29293,28130,3944,606,5019,513,4667,261,9952,514,272,5976,2933,13,356,17771,653,28800,22299,4502,389,5363,1339,6316,81645,1765,653,25911,46089,11,15890,514,88486,324,1826,45324,978,1880,934,54386,1208,23933,1339,42676,27584,1860,11967,13,1952,25692,45575,23423,261,3869,26633,45455,4558,9459,11,45441,3900,379,264,951,47104,7930,14848,951,52088,66474,409,272,5976,2933,11,45441,3900,379,264,951,47104,7930,17258,784,306,1208,81645,11,45441,3900,379,264,951,47104,7930,1208,28387,406,13,356,17771,1208,27584,14896,5019,3625,21850,3233,409,1208,44669,483,13,1952,73953,1744,3846,15132,3625,2849,2482,409,326,6,52822,321,11,7930,513,10109,306,665,21273,788,11,7930,28387,406,3625,21850,3233,409,1208,44669,483,1765,514,81337,11,83786,25108,52985,326,65948,647,1133,409,28130,3944,606,11,77433,8065,43014,46152,513,4667,306,9952,514,272,5976,2933,13,27058,77680,3125,20662,887,8047,11,503,34155,5363,978,951,44481,2439,7930,14848,6316,27472,78422,99188,1880,7930,841,369,479,6502,294,6,52822,321,13,622,34155,33614,1744,1765,27750,44481,2439,11,3625,21850,3233,409,1208,44669,483,308,49152,1149,306,6502,13,62463,100246,3355,89810,2389,404,1195,29449,45455,4558,325,11,65735,1208,88265,3625,21850,3233,409,1208,44669,483,11,15132,5636,6033,40970,3608,8467,11,1880,39587,11,46152,841,34501,77,306,6502,13,356,17771,6316,98652,65735,1208,88265,3625,2849,2482,409,326,6,52822,321,28387,406,3625,21850,3233,409,1208,44669,483,11,1880,20605,265,934,35329,308,59858,264,6502,1744,3625,22337,20243,2482,38094,8467,7930,15132,75419,8065,45369,3930,82620,11,10071,28463,3625,8603,32118,4919,8467,13,33150,48226,6496,409,1208,44669,483,3930,3273,49363,1167,4558,21152,11,64972,60946,265,514,436,57332,951,8603,32118,4919,8467,8065,45369,3930,82620,1469,403,2473,653,35462,4046,49272,425,1765,3625,8811,17491,3930,72601,32015,2249,13,1708,1105,11,1744,1208,5457,45441,9952,26317,21850,3233,758,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,8586,374,279,11093,1495,512,198,644,856,27692,11,584,2610,264,4856,4382,3488,430,499,617,22225,2736,4691,25,1268,656,24869,1376,30,31886,279,14738,3721,27645,4320,6699,3041,872,2911,11,584,2216,5895,1268,11,505,264,36214,1534,19151,2849,11,584,649,1893,4553,44304,1093,499,323,757,13,3639,12034,757,8104,2391,44481,14338,4500,374,34313,11,7917,430,30382,2038,13,2650,656,814,2361,5694,304,279,1314,2035,304,279,47120,323,4667,12722,449,1855,1023,311,1376,16003,46121,30,4314,4860,617,2736,1027,1664,20041,505,264,11742,13356,11,449,279,18841,315,35715,430,8641,34313,11,719,279,
