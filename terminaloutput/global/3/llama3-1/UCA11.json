It's a transcription of a lecture or presentation on the concept of \"infraction-obstacle\" (a French term that roughly translates to \"anticipatory penalty\" or \"preventive measure\"). The speaker discusses how this concept is increasingly relevant in modern society, where there is a growing need for security and prevention.\n\nThe text begins by presenting a thought experiment: imagine a future society where there is no more violence, crime, or terrorism. To achieve this, the speaker proposes that the law could be modified to allow for anticipatory measures to prevent potential crimes from being committed. This would involve identifying individuals who are likely to commit a crime and taking action before they actually do.\n\nThe speaker notes that this concept is not entirely new, as our society already values protection and security above all else. They argue that the infraction-obstacle is simply an extension of this trend, where the law seeks to anticipate and prevent potential crimes rather than just punishing those who have committed them.\n\nHowever, the speaker also warns about the dangers of overstepping in this direction. They suggest that without careful consideration of the limits and boundaries of such measures, we risk sacrificing our fundamental rights and freedoms in the name of security.\n\nThe rest of the text is a discussion of the theoretical framework surrounding infraction-obstacles, including their definition, types, and practical applications. The speaker aims to establish a general theory around this concept, which would allow us to better understand its limitations and potential consequences for our society.\n\nOverall, the text presents a thought-provoking exploration of the tensions between security and liberty in modern society. It encourages us to think critically about the trade-offs we make between these two values and to consider the long-term implications of such measures.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,362,19610,45325,46939,69379,84,89504,409,326,6,13885,16597,93549,44698,949,11842,949,13789,11,45575,1081,268,3209,2439,1370,6316,38920,88411,409,23423,8047,13,38891,89,6316,77824,3938,11,10071,6502,21965,781,396,8511,11,7010,1208,88265,3900,308,59858,44521,1339,5636,409,9349,11,5636,409,7591,3817,447,685,11,5636,409,24020,68,13,39783,77824,39587,7010,1208,88265,17317,308,6,4202,2439,5636,3869,1207,404,951,4046,5287,958,1083,4893,409,955,220,1954,4520,77807,37093,74687,514,9977,308,58736,1601,1339,5636,13,12535,949,2895,66096,3869,1208,82291,11,7930,29557,30532,294,6,1138,5615,466,653,23496,84,409,85722,16961,8047,11,87451,37953,934,54386,264,9517,16080,3869,4538,665,31400,8657,285,64656,294,6,29982,1392,7930,29557,73468,294,31769,74199,404,934,35329,29253,653,10025,593,36875,13327,409,59157,8082,294,31109,4225,16597,13,445,6,13885,16597,308,26248,27584,6502,3869,23761,7591,23827,8047,1236,6,93772,294,31109,4046,688,940,13109,29557,294,6,77196,72684,6316,45361,281,10610,1604,27389,688,535,13,1708,1105,4864,63762,3846,1744,9189,9189,294,3695,13,62408,13356,18111,324,17194,1826,12266,75804,88253,5253,83,5019,61512,11,9189,514,3665,89,11,17317,18434,2439,7010,653,38900,7930,348,1082,3869,326,6,360,2221,10039,40241,13,19421,514,64079,281,10610,278,7010,29449,77824,11,7930,7591,5098,483,3846,7930,1826,12553,635,6033,3900,416,635,11,8541,25400,28463,5553,3846,63669,294,6,8322,49686,13,19421,3900,97487,1744,3846,45441,55162,10036,1370,6316,25626,48901,951,55467,5168,788,665,294,2182,89,949,1183,12416,14707,13,29124,83,664,919,40126,3625,9517,4109,3435,8467,1880,32118,8747,266,8467,7930,4046,1195,16149,3869,1208,16578,294,22827,52309,266,13,5034,55133,3488,7930,513,17477,1826,27058,62998,42067,23496,84,11,4635,84,951,3600,409,4379,11,5019,951,86696,326,8362,1354,6033,5019,274,93825,18336,69068,11,43989,57375,44093,665,22848,978,949,1952,3567,72,408,14687,39587,8818,17194,33670,27584,294,49152,13603,945,72,732,17771,665,16968,4865,6316,23423,8047,961,351,8047,1370,653,6800,13026,409,3613,275,2303,729,1880,409,12155,4294,4893,3435,8467,11,7930,4263,306,1880,4046,14717,69625,3625,781,285,13,19421,272,17771,3846,7930,1120,57609,326,31769,1195,29355,1880,514,82620,11,41199,514,83259,3930,30388,68,97739,9326,11,409,42067,704,321,16422,307,2428,9721,519,934,17771,326,6,13885,16597,93549,44698,13,2009,64079,281,10610,278,841,513,71080,5636,45575,70374,3869,45361,1215,11,10071,44767,3869,21945,466,3625,82134,52962,3808,3869,46932,265,8231,39904,7364,3869,7364,294,31109,34501,65461,60224,3869,6316,34501,20862,64829,13,356,13059,519,11,653,38847,1826,3869,70375,5019,1370,3716,556,514,82620,409,3846,32118,4919,44618,13,5034,5790,263,5979,367,409,12155,97222,21901,2908,12249,8065,9859,409,1208,11347,265,36959,68,77463,88661,361,5253,83,379,74533,5392,788,9517,301,1001,550,5615,2641,949,356,17771,49733,1744,11083,58673,2249,864,7521,306,2035,13,445,41901,3841,84,1826,294,31769,74199,404,6316,76680,30303,46680,46140,90053,409,326,6,13885,16597,93549,44698,11,1208,7591,5589,404,11,4046,2470,52424,26077,645,49276,5247,14848,7010,3846,60697,11,14240,664,1291,28130,3851,95234,1880,665,7591,23827,261,43153,57705,978,2889,8467,13,1611,39015,11,4864,5019,41098,4046,6414,3913,62321,1880,12108,26077,645,15132,3625,4017,288,73083,3916,7930,841,56311,1880,76776,841,97569,23761,704,265,6519,14014,7010,326,6,19010,4422,367,409,3846,955,294,6,13885,16597,74687,15878,9517,12287,290,1765,3846,70927,11,7010,326,6,5389,404,11,326,6,13885,16597,93549,44698,92215,23761,16898,30885,8047,9952,6316,79036,409,6667,68,665,58617,409,12155,46681,1880,409,12155,17320,17274,645,665,48234,294,31769,74199,404,5019,95917,359,294,6,40997,17317,85114,2848,8839,3869,10025,593,13,41621,326,26248,554,89,13550,285,11,11083,58673,2249,274,6,1354,5192,81541,39587,7010,6316,8335,738,5048,9465,9517,4099,1880,22848,978,13,5034,22848,978,11,5019,93224,554,11,14240,519,1208,67239,978,5019,95917,359,294,6,40997,17317,409,5293,261,3869,326,6,19010,4422,367,951,47371,4144,82,951,6155,1673,288,7930,274,6,77196,72684,546,1880,274,98279,20672,546,3869,17317,7010,326,6,5389,404,3587,68,9189,312,1195,25134,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,27387,1495,0,1102,596,264,46940,315,264,31678,477,15864,389,279,7434,315,330,13885,16597,93549,44698,1,320,64,8753,4751,430,17715,48018,311,330,8322,575,5382,16750,1,477,330,93755,535,6767,1865,578,19114,35434,1268,420,7434,374,15098,9959,304,6617,8396,11,1405,1070,374,264,7982,1205,369,4868,323,27344,627,198,791,1495,12302,555,32644,264,3463,9526,25,13085,264,3938,8396,1405,1070,374,912,810,9349,11,9977,11,477,24020,13,2057,11322,420,11,279,19114,55725,430,279,2383,1436,387,11041,311,2187,369,16961,5382,11193,311,5471,4754,17073,505,1694,11411,13,1115,1053,21736,25607,7931,889,527,4461,311,5379,264,9977,323,4737,1957,1603,814,3604,656,627,198,791,19114,8554,430,420,7434,374,539,11622,502,11,439,1057,8396,2736,2819,9313,323,486
