It's a transcript of a talk by a linguist, and it's full of interesting insights and analogies about language, phonology, and the human brain.\n\nHere are some key points that I'd like to highlight:\n\n1. **The linguist's approach**: The speaker is not interested in studying the meanings of words, but rather the sounds of languages. They're a phonologist, which means they focus on the sounds and sound patterns of languages.\n2. **Languages as cars**: The linguist compares languages to cars, with each language having its own unique \"engine\" or set of sounds that make it distinct. This is a great way to think about the diversity of human languages!\n3. **Inventories of sounds**: The speaker talks about inventories of sounds in the brain, which are like mental storage facilities for the sounds of different languages. These inventories can be quite different across languages, and this has implications for how we process language.\n4. **The importance of sound patterns**: The linguist emphasizes that knowing the sound patterns of a language is crucial for speaking it fluently. This goes beyond just having a good accent!\n5. **Rare consonants**: The speaker highlights some rare consonant sounds found in certain languages, such as B and C. They're interested in understanding why these sounds are more common in some languages than others.\n6. **The connection between language and brain**: The linguist suggests that there's an important link between the sounds of our languages and what goes on in our brains. This is a fascinating area of research, and it has implications for our understanding of human cognition.\n\nOverall, this text is a great example of how linguistics can be a fascinating and interdisciplinary field that combines insights from psychology, anthropology, and computer science.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,816,17243,11,480,12498,11,20774,2234,11,12015,88798,13,11842,11,4864,841,36731,6502,6316,10896,5048,665,5542,409,20028,6316,1589,1082,11,4864,9189,36015,13,14465,3355,729,409,19126,263,3913,99309,78199,7010,99309,8859,1157,25945,96642,13,34447,27750,99309,78199,14848,79071,14896,409,25945,3062,665,34561,13,19421,41091,11,665,37622,1744,39603,17194,11,4864,52571,3869,60946,265,13,34447,9189,12584,89,757,7631,261,11,12769,61651,11,1208,39603,17194,11,294,3695,5392,788,11,1744,76605,13510,27750,99309,78199,45575,949,8345,19421,4864,91507,9189,13510,11,4864,841,63762,6502,13,4366,346,1744,41091,11,4864,841,36731,6502,6316,39603,17194,7617,1604,13,2998,5589,11,4864,841,36731,6502,71269,689,1001,33288,2536,5636,13,34447,41091,11,4864,308,57286,664,648,6502,3625,6225,951,78199,11,503,57286,664,648,3625,26419,951,8859,1157,13,34447,272,17771,75249,653,39603,17194,949,80905,294,6,370,541,11,653,39603,17194,841,1370,273,6502,52842,42625,51854,8859,1157,13,1952,308,17771,6502,78422,648,665,1099,13400,556,11,13080,665,30299,540,4714,383,13,1252,39603,17194,1826,26077,447,22827,7930,61735,19227,1001,3625,8859,1157,11,934,35329,76605,3625,59148,716,665,11990,409,4411,346,12249,1880,4043,1155,409,3625,51010,36501,5019,46131,4068,84568,34501,77,306,13,1952,1826,653,28800,22299,3625,32118,4919,3457,729,13,1952,61735,5945,72905,514,2107,354,5019,20028,57625,15610,7010,3625,88486,1759,951,8859,1157,13,19421,3846,7930,1826,27584,5636,78422,532,11,272,17771,1744,46777,96282,1826,22299,6316,81645,51199,68,13,2009,55467,11,22299,74637,9952,4538,88486,324,7930,436,263,2298,818,13,19421,326,6,124524,2852,11,7930,1826,653,28800,22299,514,12015,29008,934,54386,4160,275,961,412,1880,7930,20272,71151,951,1437,12059,293,11403,417,13,426,1116,11,3846,7930,296,55624,978,22550,11,272,17771,1120,1133,514,1437,3159,409,88486,324,13,4366,346,1744,39043,17317,665,22011,48488,1765,4068,34501,77,306,3625,88486,1759,84440,1474,5615,9004,13,19421,7010,1647,96839,11,1208,51923,38469,11,389,1239,42441,32592,12155,2047,417,2107,2469,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,514,272,5976,2933,13,1952,42775,273,9952,3846,934,54386,917,6853,951,17459,17724,13,356,17771,22299,951,5708,1154,409,26419,1179,1821,7010,46777,96282,1744,9189,47592,4685,8047,7010,514,272,5976,2933,13,34447,27750,5708,1154,2609,306,9952,46777,96282,1744,9189,1370,41881,13,4366,51173,11,7010,7643,96282,308,460,273,11,3846,7930,1826,326,6,124524,2852,11,389,308,26248,6502,514,4538,549,22299,56949,13,1952,308,26248,1744,514,4538,63935,22299,29465,68,13,19421,3930,16081,11,3625,6590,385,17144,14848,3930,8811,9465,27750,26633,26419,549,1880,549,13,34447,46152,834,306,1744,3846,308,17771,6502,25945,3062,1208,44178,16271,9465,549,1880,549,13,62463,26419,513,594,28111,306,19227,1001,13,1952,17317,60946,42676,389,1370,273,55467,11,259,52152,47391,66522,13,34447,272,17771,42676,27584,1208,44178,16271,9465,72006,16081,1880,72006,11957,13,1708,1105,11,14707,89504,6316,96282,308,26248,55455,3869,46131,9952,653,7970,30200,22299,389,9189,917,9484,3869,326,31769,56745,13,356,17771,76776,74282,66014,1880,44178,63934,1291,9465,3625,26419,1179,1821,7010,3625,5708,1154,294,31109,96282,11,3869,326,49455,265,13,1708,1105,11,19443,2439,3869,27750,99309,78199,3930,65385,13,3489,17771,54312,934,85217,14848,665,34561,949,2998,20272,11,46152,687,72,89810,45889,12,8699,951,78605,4978,3625,5636,436,5518,3930,38900,11,22299,426,11,356,6033,426,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,11,389,38831,83384,25945,28800,409,4160,42204,39723,514,88486,324,20272,653,409,27750,99309,1437,12059,2922,6496,13,19421,41091,11,7010,7643,270,4558,325,11,503,6,26577,648,294,6,30992,72684,87320,3738,288,8859,1157,687,72,89810,27750,78605,4978,436,5518,11,10071,6502,294,81979,13,4366,346,934,35329,379,264,653,55520,3062,9465,3625,26419,409,12155,8859,1157,1880,3846,7930,513,39904,7010,12155,272,5976,12249,13,19421,1208,51923,38469,17317,29557,409,5363,261,32592,514,2107,354,409,12155,8859,1157,1880,409,17317,1474,5615,9004,13,14465,9189,312,1195,25134,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,27387,1495,0,1102,596,264,36815,315,264,3137,555,264,39603,380,11,323,433,596,2539,315,7185,26793,323,24291,552,922,4221,11,51923,2508,11,323,279,3823,8271,627,198,8586,527,1063,1401,3585,430,358,4265,1093,311,11415,512,198,16,13,3146,791,39603,380,596,5603,96618,578,19114,374,539,8173,304,21630,279,50800,315,4339,11,719,4856,279,10578,315,15823,13,2435,2351,264,51923,16549,11,902,3445,814,5357,389,279,10578,323,5222,12912,315,15823,13,198,17,13,3146,60386,439,9515,96618,578,39603,380,43565,15823,311,9515,11,449,1855,4221,3515,1202,1866,5016,330,8680,1,477,743,315,10578,430,1304,433,12742,13,1115,374,264,2294,1648,311,1781,922,279,20057,315,3823,15823,0,198,18,13,3146,644,688,2490,315,10578,96618,578,19114,13739,922,17459,2490,315,10578,304,279,8271,11,902,527,1093,10723,5942,13077,369,279,10578,315,2204,15823,13,4314,17459,2490,649,387,5115,2204
