Here's a summary of the main points:\n\n* The speaker imagines a parallel universe where everyone has a personal assistant, bodyguard, stylist, chef, and banker who helps them with their projects and makes sure they're happy.\n* This universe is called \"childhood\" and these people are referred to as \"parents\".\n* The speaker notes that psychologists have traditionally blamed parents for all the world's problems, but few have looked at how parents experience being a parent themselves.\n* The culture expects parenting to always be positive, with young parents receiving congratulations and gifts. However, this is not always the case, and many parents struggle with burnout.\n* Research shows that parents suffer from burnout more than high-powered business executives.\n* Burnout can have severe consequences for children, couples, and families as a whole, including increased conflict, violence, neglect, and abuse.\n* The speaker's role as a psychologist is to predict and prevent parental burnout by providing support and resources to parents.\n* A program was developed with colleagues to teach parents stress management techniques, mindfulness, and emotional regulation.\n* To evaluate the effectiveness of this program, the speaker collects small hair samples from participants before and after the program to measure cortisol levels (a marker of chronic stress) and assess changes in their overall health and well-being.\n\nOverall, the presentation highlights the importance of supporting parents in their role and providing resources to help them cope with the stresses and challenges of parenting.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,38891,89,653,11159,1370,543,51453,7010,514,43014,9189,26725,28490,89,294,22827,74817,12844,6223,978,11,294,22827,22641,3675,3930,34922,11,294,22827,18078,65746,11,294,22827,31547,258,1291,7930,27389,3462,5019,9189,26725,26317,628,1900,27389,69,14081,5512,1880,294,22827,9120,33571,22176,64,7930,17452,26317,22040,1441,3625,5636,282,788,1880,7930,513,27389,14310,86577,1744,9189,779,9188,89,44093,77818,2249,13,356,295,11159,11,76190,2439,31307,326,41901,69,685,13,19421,40744,27750,48577,64555,17724,11,76190,2439,12,645,6699,13,4241,9425,951,35881,2734,552,11,3625,8841,1640,1157,14848,84788,72,3869,17780,8977,1208,4294,87782,409,16968,514,8811,383,324,3930,38900,10253,6699,13,356,13059,519,11,25945,28800,409,76305,75460,274,55624,978,676,306,3869,4068,3625,6699,11,84440,11,18434,306,28130,46679,13109,13,46706,29449,7829,11,3900,379,264,6316,1651,6960,5019,1744,1208,46679,13109,45441,44093,13,39783,88411,6928,13,11876,60120,6699,312,20822,81541,951,503,337,552,7558,288,11,951,58482,6154,811,1880,84871,409,86696,78418,12249,296,625,2439,13,11876,60404,15132,16265,8839,11,39587,3625,6699,3567,969,1188,23761,3625,5636,77818,2249,3930,38900,13,356,8458,1826,83195,11,10071,6502,16968,514,27138,13,2998,59157,13109,11,23761,2748,11,39043,36709,13,64105,64,36709,3869,19227,1486,1744,409,5636,665,5636,409,33820,598,1880,409,26365,300,308,6,1138,81541,5636,3869,513,75802,88778,5512,13,81245,274,31769,652,285,306,13,5034,38317,20605,265,27584,934,85217,274,31769,652,285,306,5636,1744,3625,53542,294,82405,17724,13,41621,62299,6350,285,949,9424,688,11,3625,6699,84440,1474,5615,9004,841,11427,306,6502,934,85217,5945,544,8135,409,8395,9994,46679,13,11876,1615,978,45045,409,8395,9994,46679,15132,25945,19266,85,31539,13,12623,409,83977,1220,11,5636,409,4738,2436,11,5636,409,38605,6200,343,2436,1880,409,8811,30532,3095,13,350,519,5019,326,41901,61827,11,3625,21961,11,3625,2138,31355,1218,59307,13,3206,436,57332,665,37622,1744,8841,77828,6824,68,3869,550,15433,556,13,19421,3869,27389,43406,326,53149,9425,1133,951,6699,13,62293,11083,4631,4558,70,1157,11,17317,57038,390,79884,653,18629,409,27389,7611,7930,348,1082,3869,2579,263,1215,10253,6699,409,1208,274,14081,10610,13109,11,3930,60020,11,409,1208,24617,13,33150,45369,294,6,84426,4918,11,503,6,57379,3625,6699,3869,917,9484,265,951,12823,409,59471,3930,8631,11,409,7245,483,42563,11,409,59471,951,4046,76,41356,61907,3742,13,34447,4068,47929,1744,1647,21623,1826,31914,580,949,61651,14707,11,4864,57625,4618,7010,1208,83067,951,6699,13,41621,5019,7379,89,9189,13510,11,12769,11876,8841,1640,1157,11,39587,11,272,17771,4725,13,8345,34447,4864,1239,42441,28463,43153,3091,588,2249,13,27058,4046,838,8977,326,6,6581,292,582,13109,409,20662,21623,11,4864,28130,550,19010,79351,951,98385,296,4558,8696,409,3091,588,2249,33670,1880,3869,1208,1913,3930,18629,5019,93455,514,9637,2249,409,89942,2107,6374,556,11,75467,324,3930,8631,27076,2428,11,1880,10484,3125,326,58591,73511,7769,409,28130,14240,266,409,77323,1880,409,14707,85815,13,1952,308,53149,9484,6502,3869,326,31769,56745,3869,23761,653,7970,2748,13,24703,87264,951,14707,21965,1317,1157,14240,29246,11,25692,85815,27584,4225,258,552,13,356,17771,87320,7010,11083,58673,2249,11,503,6,434,61055,409,46524,951,10105,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2028,8111,311,387,264,36815,315,264,15864,477,31678,555,264,54595,389,279,8712,315,46679,8395,412,323,279,12939,315,12899,6699,304,872,3560,13,5810,596,264,12399,315,279,1925,3585,1473,9,578,19114,6669,1572,264,15638,15861,1405,5127,706,264,4443,18328,11,2547,27190,11,67473,11,30806,11,323,72759,889,8779,1124,449,872,7224,323,3727,2771,814,2351,6380,13,198,9,1115,15861,374,2663,330,3124,5812,1,323,1521,1274,527,14183,311,439,330,26534,3343,198,9,578,19114,8554,430,74191,617,36342,36197,6699,369,682,279,1917,596,5435,11,719,2478,617,7111,520,1268,6699,3217,1694,264,2748,5694,13,198,9,578,7829,25283,49058,311,2744,387,6928,11,449,3995,6699,12588,82644,323,21258,13,4452,11,420,374,539,2744,279,1162,11,323,1690,6699,14993,449,8395,412,13,198,9,8483,5039,430,6699,7831,505,8395,412,810,1109,1579,41503,2626,29509,13,198,9,18530,412,649,617,15748,16296,369,2911,11,21961,11,323,8689,439,264,4459,11,2737,7319,12324,11,9349,11,39332,11,323,11737,13,198,9,578,19114,596,3560,439,264,54595,374,311,7168,323,5471,46679,8395,412,555,8405,1862,323,5070,311,6699,13,198,9,362,2068,574,8040,449,18105,311,4639,6699,8631,6373,12823,11,71705,11,323,14604,19812,13,198,9,2057,15806,279,27375,315,420,2068,11,279,19114,52307,2678,7013,10688,505,13324,1603,323,1306,279,2068,311,6767,89942,5990,320,64,11381,315,21249,8631,8,323,8720,4442,304,872,8244,2890,323,1664,33851,627,198,28589,11,279,15864,22020,279,12939,315,12899,6699,304,872,3560,323,8405,5070,311,1520,1124,37586,449,279,59623,323,11774,315,49058,13,128009],"total_duration":11153242832,"load_duration":229651,"prompt_eval_count":672,"prompt_eval_duration":132
