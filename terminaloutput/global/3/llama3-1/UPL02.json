Here's my attempt to summarize and combine the different texts:\n\nThe author reflects on her niece Jeanne asking her existential questions at the age of 5, such as \"Tata, j'étais où avant de naître?\" (Where was I before I was born?). This led her to discover the practice of philosophical discussions with children, which aims to consider them not just as small beings to be protected, but as genuine subjects who can think for themselves. She notes that this approach is in line with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which considers children as real subjects of rights.\n\nThe author's research focuses on education and human rights, particularly the UNESCO global programme on human rights education launched in 2004. She wonders how to implement such a programme and whether philosophical discussions with children could be a lever for better understanding and appropriation of their rights.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, she trained herself to lead philosophy workshops with children, aiming to create a pedagogical protocol that transforms articles of the Convention into genuine philosophical discussions. However, she acknowledges the critique of Western-centeredness in the construction of human rights and wonders how education can respond to these challenges while ensuring cultural pluralism.\n\nIn her view, the practice of philosophical discussions with children, which is more horizontal and child-centered, could be a way to guarantee intercultural reflection and construct a possible universal. She concludes by apologizing to Jeanne for not being able to answer her question earlier, but now she can do so for all children, including Antoine, her nephew who will soon turn 5.\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to clarify or expand on any specific points!","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,88245,11,503,31769,2629,285,39723,33670,409,4415,66014,949,64105,64,11,272,17771,1208,3488,1744,7643,13080,4558,346,20263,818,296,26248,1153,8047,3869,220,20,8261,13,1708,1105,3154,519,9189,13510,1744,4864,841,11427,2852,6502,21965,75249,75871,265,13,29124,66,2182,20263,818,11,9964,72567,300,39043,42676,9964,1446,300,5636,25626,11,294,69537,541,949,74656,97717,11,27549,43989,7591,3209,361,409,7643,90509,13,14465,1208,60946,82,13,11842,10071,272,17771,83195,11,272,17771,57625,39043,13,350,788,27750,60404,7930,17317,1153,306,951,4860,3073,306,13327,645,11,1880,17317,7930,74533,39015,3869,293,19395,1155,11,4864,36731,78705,265,1744,39043,9189,1826,46939,69003,978,13,2998,16968,4865,11,41091,39043,296,26248,10805,27843,8047,13,19421,272,17771,22299,39043,1744,503,34155,59148,1653,1208,95234,409,1208,13868,648,9952,3625,60404,13,452,8047,32592,326,6,8039,580,3930,10891,437,81509,4242,26235,445,2877,18022,7010,3625,65838,220,2031,13,39783,95234,7930,274,17771,68866,8047,409,961,412,7010,514,38900,13,19421,4864,757,36731,22011,11,55475,9952,3625,60404,11,272,17771,3625,77554,52424,2536,6502,71686,22299,951,86696,20183,45632,3869,1760,978,1414,11,10071,22299,409,45165,1018,4893,924,75004,7930,56311,23423,261,1370,84440,1474,5615,9004,13,2582,11,389,38831,83384,20662,43656,7010,1208,26958,2655,38135,951,97222,409,326,41901,61827,409,220,3753,24,11,7930,77554,12339,326,41901,61827,22299,653,45165,23349,70927,409,64079,13,19421,326,6,12210,13109,11,19189,65699,62891,11,841,17317,282,2473,6502,13510,514,32150,556,13,1708,1105,11,16968,39043,11,41091,39043,296,55624,978,22550,66021,1744,503,57286,664,648,514,64079,3869,326,31769,34985,11,1880,5636,51625,285,42625,326,31769,34985,10253,97222,2854,1771,13,1708,1105,11,3625,19687,1252,552,14848,5906,665,2035,41199,220,1049,19,11,653,18629,62940,532,294,31769,34985,10253,97222,409,326,6,87713,11,15890,1208,55133,10474,60172,1765,326,6,1137,625,1133,36413,556,1880,2132,12267,13,34447,45575,11,4068,48021,665,99225,61480,653,19227,18629,949,7695,47090,100243,479,9517,1517,978,331,404,10253,13531,35933,281,15433,55180,8467,13,9589,54312,1744,9189,3567,39395,39723,4864,5320,2249,665,96586,949,9589,54312,1744,1208,95234,409,1208,13868,648,9952,3625,60404,841,92215,6502,23761,653,23464,1291,5019,6316,94721,86740,409,43153,97222,949,1708,1105,11,4864,841,63762,6502,13,1708,1105,11,5019,38211,20662,45455,4558,325,11,4864,91507,1765,514,25911,13,1219,2727,514,46110,1732,68155,11,39015,11,4864,757,36731,1376,8047,3869,459,3212,951,520,301,4918,409,13868,648,9952,3625,60404,11,5019,20028,665,80444,1744,3625,60404,841,834,306,6502,3846,934,85217,23423,306,11,10071,934,85217,23423,306,3846,934,85217,834,306,11,3625,1097,804,3869,6316,3738,68,74772,768,13868,2428,13,3206,1665,333,11,272,17771,409,75831,653,1760,511,1286,281,15433,55180,2428,7930,43678,1339,76076,9908,409,1208,26958,2655,38135,951,97222,409,326,41901,61827,665,409,45165,1018,4893,520,301,4918,409,13868,648,11,5019,76826,11083,7889,6033,2536,1208,18713,258,768,294,22827,19227,1760,511,1286,13,34447,3900,379,264,653,10071,13,3489,17771,54312,1744,39043,1879,57609,11,6316,4046,34985,11159,6853,10253,97222,409,326,6,87713,949,14465,841,36731,6502,15878,47929,934,35329,29253,6316,65058,43665,3930,57705,12339,3056,1748,12812,21911,43711,409,1208,8246,27584,409,27750,97222,13,19421,20662,43665,841,296,48099,6502,1744,951,38682,1769,42284,83391,13,1708,1105,11,4068,326,31769,34985,10253,97222,2854,1771,25692,12,6853,75871,265,3869,27750,665,3841,2249,11,40192,404,514,39598,44618,7829,75,949,14465,66517,326,39982,1100,8942,4558,325,1744,1370,1208,95234,409,1208,13868,648,9952,3625,60404,11,7930,1826,6316,281,15433,55180,648,5636,4917,6317,1604,11,7930,2322,326,41901,61827,8065,272,89412,409,15907,9517,12287,919,1765,3625,97222,11,45575,389,25692,40192,404,326,6,6802,1728,409,1208,13868,648,9952,3625,60404,11,389,25692,40192,404,326,6,2295,66,44547,13109,8065,19910,409,1208,9517,12287,290,11,16968,665,9071,519,409,9517,1517,978,331,404,3869,653,11159,301,3284,1880,19477,3159,13,1708,1105,20263,818,11,4864,36731,46838,337,8047,11,4864,308,34155,6502,924,12646,2159,404,3869,9637,3488,11,10071,9964,100164,11,74699,4864,91507,68226,514,20028,5019,26725,3625,46106,60404,11,3869,1081,20099,1370,91254,11,4538,46110,1448,12339,11,7930,25400,11,264,293,1188,35657,220,20,8261,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,32,8753,1495,0,5810,596,856,4879,311,63179,323,16343,279,2204,22755,512,198,791,3229,27053,389,1077,80115,20263,818,10371,1077,67739,4860,520,279,4325,315,220,20,11,1778,439,330,51,460,11,503,31769,2629,285,39723,33670,409,4415,66014,7673,320,9241,574,358,1603,358,574,9405,48366,1115,6197,1077,311,7142,279,6725,315,41903,20954,449,2911,11,902,22262,311,2980,1124,539,1120,439,2678,23837,311,387,2682,11,719,439,22785,15223,889,649,1781,369,5694,13,3005,8554,430,420,5603,374,304,1584,449,279,3723,19687,26958,389,279,10734,315,2
