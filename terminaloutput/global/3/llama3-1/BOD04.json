The speaker, who is likely a researcher in the field of cognitive science or neuroscience, is discussing the limitations of purely rational approaches to decision-making and the importance of considering contextual factors and emotional influences.\n\nThe speaker begins by introducing the concept of IA and its potential impact on our lives. However, they quickly move on to discuss the importance of human intelligence (I) and its ability to adapt to changing contexts. They use a personal anecdote about deciding whether to buy bread from a bakery that has a large dog at the entrance as an example of how humans make decisions based on multiple factors, including rational considerations and emotional influences.\n\nThe speaker then explains that researchers have been studying the neural mechanisms underlying human decision-making processes using techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). They note that these studies have shown that different regions of the brain are involved in different types of decision-making, including rational and emotional processing.\n\nTo test their theories, the researcher uses a video game like Minecraft to create a virtual environment where agents can make decisions based on their understanding of human decision-making processes. This allows them to observe how these agents interact with each other and respond to different scenarios, such as encountering a virtual dog at a virtual bakery entrance.\n\nThe speaker concludes by highlighting the importance of considering both rational and emotional factors in decision-making and the potential benefits of using IA to inform our decisions. They also note that their research is situated at the intersection of neuroscience and computer science, making it a unique and interdisciplinary field of study.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,13789,30362,1880,31074,561,978,13,14465,36731,97717,1744,9189,47592,46939,69379,84,89504,409,1208,48659,9517,65272,7930,274,53149,6853,326,55624,8677,1989,1104,72,6853,11,1208,84850,4558,21152,44190,13,34447,841,9189,304,47391,978,668,89,6502,11,4864,841,91507,6502,4043,1155,409,9189,5804,467,846,1744,326,6,5987,11412,16968,30870,273,3078,261,7010,15265,17536,13,2998,20272,11,7643,270,4558,325,3613,68495,1208,48901,1208,5636,36897,409,326,6,5987,11,272,17771,514,358,11,326,55624,8677,13,38891,89,11,3900,1826,326,6,75876,3930,7591,3841,48137,11,9189,47592,2267,318,11,9189,12584,89,99490,6316,9145,84,6672,3869,1208,293,11206,4091,648,3930,16652,13,34447,665,69003,519,11,9189,23933,10333,934,35329,379,264,653,4046,20609,68,523,3675,3869,81337,409,1208,60172,409,1208,293,11206,4091,648,13,41621,47592,45575,45889,65995,409,2132,288,5019,35881,1814,11,1826,54312,934,54386,379,11412,6033,389,11412,23008,9211,6316,47838,293,11206,4091,648,653,28800,5636,78060,13,12095,4864,348,11206,2852,31807,3023,265,3846,80259,9952,6316,3057,1557,10748,479,66901,64829,11,4864,48888,2852,951,4046,447,811,7930,864,7521,306,665,42463,1647,53052,409,2267,318,11,1208,62827,3930,523,3675,11,274,35329,264,326,6,1334,60019,32118,11943,11,1208,6138,409,1208,293,11206,4091,648,46932,5048,11,5099,13,3341,3900,47090,14707,1744,7643,35881,1854,2109,974,13,19421,74699,11,1043,981,2439,1744,4864,9189,991,76,48099,46206,41091,665,2314,68,11,2145,2058,1647,2307,21935,13,34447,1647,4046,447,367,841,15572,68,5636,3930,16968,13,13789,11,55133,479,66021,1744,39015,1481,300,11,3900,348,2784,64972,513,32118,69,1291,409,26725,3625,26883,729,11,27584,3625,5636,86696,13,19421,76776,11,27584,4502,9189,47592,1208,6140,409,46524,6316,293,11206,4091,648,7930,20272,951,9145,14127,2392,11,1208,463,331,8511,35737,78705,55755,3869,951,2960,33903,409,15395,316,75104,13,34447,3846,308,17771,6502,25165,11,17317,682,2439,25945,83457,17317,13253,1880,389,11412,296,4091,12155,14135,36527,1880,7591,416,53819,13,25145,72,13,19421,7591,416,53819,2536,1280,80463,13,34447,87451,29449,54606,665,9822,11,389,312,59976,12155,17536,31355,6183,21237,1880,12155,9145,14127,2392,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,934,54386,308,6,283,2067,648,6502,1208,70311,4046,447,367,11,10071,17317,17317,11142,2439,665,34501,3930,2317,68,13,2582,11,9189,1880,41091,11,77433,3869,29449,49370,60217,333,9598,278,11,389,35456,3846,955,409,35881,1854,26725,3625,49301,9952,5882,40948,978,11,665,57110,52727,2515,91640,26725,27750,4742,31539,11,2536,71686,66901,36527,11,10071,28463,4046,49975,36527,13,62293,3625,18247,8385,16549,288,11,7930,5363,306,96642,38682,919,409,20662,48901,3930,272,5976,2933,11,389,14240,664,648,4068,46152,83170,4558,8135,5019,71751,51794,479,1208,90509,13,34447,5019,38211,12155,4046,447,811,11,14707,97717,11,389,308,59858,11412,6502,665,2314,68,26725,3625,99309,5634,1354,9952,3625,18247,8385,16549,288,3869,1208,38317,294,31109,293,11206,4091,648,9952,951,26883,729,3869,326,6,24677,8047,13,27058,45602,11,389,69152,514,51655,57146,13,507,2005,11,17317,4186,19941,41330,22299,50026,40280,13053,4088,13,62293,3846,51655,11,4864,94297,7591,5589,404,951,13307,13,3959,86696,44190,11,22299,25400,11,7930,42587,306,1208,390,46302,951,18247,8385,16549,288,5019,71925,1992,951,33013,98942,409,35881,1854,13,19421,389,11412,68226,22842,3846,52962,1133,3663,3869,653,523,3675,13053,4088,77558,6316,293,11206,4091,648,13053,31037,13,19421,41091,11,1208,3488,1744,4864,757,17477,11,272,17771,934,17771,54312,7930,513,39904,7010,29449,272,5976,2933,42676,389,45640,665,2314,68,1880,389,76605,296,4091,6316,9145,84,6672,949,29179,321,6496,11,653,72006,70927,409,270,4558,325,3869,1208,4156,20712,951,18247,2445,12242,1880,409,326,52152,2293,2428,13,25145,72,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,791,1495,8111,311,387,264,36815,315,264,31678,477,15864,922,279,19801,315,21075,11478,320,5987,8,323,3823,5597,28846,11618,13,578,19114,11,889,374,4461,264,32185,304,279,2115,315,25702,8198,477,93048,11,374,25394,279,9669,315,32227,25442,20414,311,5597,28846,323,279,12939,315,13126,66251,9547,323,14604,34453,627,198,791,19114,12302,555,33018,279,7434,315,44190,323,1202,4754,5536,389,1057,6439,13,4452,11,814,6288,3351,389,311,4358,279,12939,315,3823,11478,320,40,8,323,1202,5845,311,10737,311,10223,38697,13,2435,1005,264,4443,50750,1295,922,30230,3508,311,3780,16385,505,264,66244,430,706,264,3544,5679,520,279,20396,439,459,3187,315,1268,12966,1304,11429,3196,389,5361,9547,11,2737,25442,38864,323,14604,34453,627,198,791,19114,1243,15100,430,12074,617,1027,21630,279,30828,24717,16940,3823,5597,28846,11618,1701,12823,1778,439,16003,24924,58081,32758,320,69,79770,570,2435,5296,430,1521,7978,617,6982,430,2204,13918,315,279,8271,527,6532,304,2204,4595,315,5597,28846,11,2737,25442,323,14604,8863,627,198,1271,1296,872,26018,11,279,32185,5829,264,2835,1847,1093,41330,311,1893,264,4200,4676,1405,13307,649,1304,11429,3196,389,8
