Your colleagues have shown that this type of culture improves overall yield and weed control. You want to identify the perfect pea partner to fight against unwanted plants.\n\nTo achieve this, you'll need to narrow down the many existing pea varieties. So, you'll present your wheat variety with a limited number of diverse pea candidates. Imagine two potential suitors: one is tall, attractive, and productive but has an upright growth habit; the other is shorter, less flashy, but has good soil coverage.\n\nYour goal is to define a profile or set of characteristics that ensures your chosen pea variety will be a good competitor against weeds. You've found that the ability of the plant to cover the soil with its vegetation helps in weed control. The more covering the pea plant is, the fewer weeds can access light and grow.\n\nYou'll test 170 European pea varieties, each with different characteristics. This time, you'll have the freedom to choose the plant and determine its genetic heritage. You'll compare this genetic information with the amount of weeds present in each plot and identify which genes to focus on for a good partner pea variety that won't let weeds get out of control.\n\nIn short, your research aims to find the perfect pea companion for wheat to reduce weed growth and improve overall crop yield.\n\n(Just a minor suggestion: you might want to consider adding more descriptive words or phrases to help readers better understand the topic. For example, instead of saying \"170 European pea varieties,\" you could specify that they're from countries like France, Italy, Spain, etc.)","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,41621,4635,2852,53070,15878,294,2182,326,31769,2796,12769,445,58591,414,1826,7010,514,27389,65801,10071,4635,2852,53070,45325,12769,445,58591,414,1826,7010,514,35641,8345,949,1221,2221,47668,3869,13528,483,48506,1132,438,11,3846,308,17771,6502,5019,653,17744,12844,1744,4864,38317,514,961,97820,887,63497,11,10071,5019,6316,4244,39883,409,1529,978,13,2998,20272,11,503,57286,664,648,1208,78422,99188,951,73083,372,483,4881,11,1880,5636,51625,285,42625,11,1208,78422,99188,3930,46110,58883,13,19421,7010,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,259,6960,409,7591,23827,261,514,46110,58883,887,63497,5019,3625,27833,58883,16677,978,13,34447,45575,11,87320,259,1992,409,3678,1291,6316,4244,39883,409,58883,9952,6316,4244,39883,409,1529,978,949,61651,14707,11,11083,4631,4558,70,1157,7330,333,8467,14848,46939,1647,376,978,1744,3846,955,409,7829,29557,83,1339,294,58591,73511,15171,514,17634,1133,3728,11,10071,44767,409,64972,7643,25108,376,12329,3625,60014,85,22626,1077,9620,13,34447,294,6,52009,1759,11,87320,60014,85,22626,949,61651,14707,11,16968,71357,66021,934,6,37907,8175,8135,665,75332,684,9952,514,1529,978,5019,1208,41263,20712,11,1880,39587,3541,14168,4538,82620,13,34447,45575,74699,11,5019,13110,3846,961,97820,887,63497,5019,326,6339,45973,3625,60014,85,22626,1077,9620,11,4068,682,2439,5392,788,13988,978,1126,3613,81,4558,79507,949,80905,294,6,370,541,11,514,13026,409,4244,10515,5512,409,58883,3073,15844,1826,14707,21965,3062,13,7695,1826,39587,28093,346,24694,409,38211,326,6,49575,951,5803,1900,3419,23202,2053,13,7695,11412,39587,26564,385,404,2515,8977,6316,55133,71132,1370,8318,27750,36852,4918,13,48109,682,2439,39587,30179,1992,3869,29449,4244,39883,409,1529,978,653,13026,2800,265,396,409,5803,1900,11,10071,9952,951,2848,8839,25945,85114,13,1952,25692,39587,6669,10670,653,21134,550,10515,20995,409,58883,11,6800,11,72006,11,2027,333,11,1794,2727,43905,25945,19266,1072,285,519,11,10071,25945,8679,978,13,1252,2132,11,5636,523,10515,333,11,40970,11124,11,5636,8563,1744,3816,8350,11,10071,57485,519,16968,409,27584,6316,51651,4020,65930,3930,2092,13,445,6,1735,333,49733,11,665,7809,519,514,65285,266,4615,1509,1370,12155,26633,550,10515,29410,11,1826,409,7591,5589,404,653,53454,11,653,40126,409,57705,978,2889,8467,7930,40192,79738,3869,29449,58883,294,93825,653,7970,75332,84048,2145,12,6496,82489,951,60014,85,22626,1077,9620,13,2582,11,7010,11083,58673,2249,11,503,34155,7838,978,1744,1208,23878,13109,409,1208,628,5048,3869,1421,283,63346,514,2092,11148,3869,326,26248,579,409,829,348,19395,10515,367,11,12576,1339,7010,1208,63922,668,45973,3625,60014,85,22626,1077,9620,13,2998,20272,11,5636,653,58883,35737,4020,19456,519,11,40970,3625,60014,85,22626,1077,9620,44521,546,1046,12416,3869,1208,41263,20712,11,1880,39587,40970,84568,5019,9598,513,52895,716,13,1708,1105,74699,1744,17317,57038,3608,90859,1744,3846,68226,4020,19456,519,43989,653,57705,12339,296,11305,324,7010,1208,63922,668,45973,3625,60014,85,22626,1077,9620,11,4864,91507,20662,37291,38211,653,6800,13026,409,4244,10515,5512,409,58883,11,220,8258,11,1880,6371,17724,409,43905,326,6,31880,13,62463,220,8258,4244,10515,5512,409,58883,57485,306,84568,28463,951,57705,978,2889,8467,25945,96642,11,10071,20662,37291,11,503,34155,44767,514,60020,409,1208,628,5048,11,1880,44767,7591,23827,978,514,3352,6417,63916,78422,99188,409,326,6,49575,409,11083,5803,1900,13,435,2259,1001,11,4864,94297,93455,20662,2038,78422,99188,9952,1208,10484,13109,409,60014,85,22626,1077,9620,30179,21938,7010,95917,2957,409,11083,30409,645,58883,16677,978,11,1880,44351,7591,23827,261,26077,342,48099,59394,665,42463,5019,39929,653,7970,550,10515,20995,11,653,550,10515,20995,7930,841,93569,6502,1208,2035,10253,60014,85,22626,1077,9620,409,513,52895,716,13,19421,272,17771,44351,1744,4864,42463,30179,1992,3869,29449,4244,39883,409,1529,978,11,653,961,97820,409,58883,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,27387,8712,4999,198,2675,2351,21630,279,56104,315,2531,19131,11,11951,279,10728,98763,8205,369,958,38984,10964,449,34153,311,12896,70535,13,4718,18105,617,6982,430,420,955,315,7829,36050,8244,7692,323,40475,2585,13,1472,1390,311,10765,279,4832,98763,8427,311,4465,2403,36021,11012,627,198,1271,11322,420,11,499,3358,1205,311,15376,1523,279,1690,6484,98763,36680,13,2100,11,499,3358,3118,701,34153,8205,449,264,7347,1396,315,17226,98763,11426,13,38891,1403,4754,7937,1105,25,832,374,16615,11,19411,11,323,27331,719,706,459,49685,6650,14464,26,279,1023,374,24210,11,2753,96567,11,719,706,1695,17614,10401,627,198,7927,5915,374,311,7124,264,5643,477,743,315,17910,430,26420,701,12146,98763,8205,690,387,264,1695,43940,2403,70535,13,1472,3077,1766,430,279,5845,315,279,6136,311,3504,279,17614,449,1202,54832,8779,304,40475,2585,13,578,810,18702,279,98763,6136,374,11,279,17162,70535,649,2680,3177,323,3139,627,198,2675,3358,1296,220,8258,7665,98763,36680,11,1855,449,2204,17910,13,1115,892,11,499,3358,617,279,11542,311
