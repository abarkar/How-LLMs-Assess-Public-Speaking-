Imagine Middle-earth 500 years after the destruction of the One Ring. Since then, this territory has experienced the Industrial Revolution and now faces difficulties in industry. And that's very problematic because the Comté is dependent on industry. To be more precise, the Comté is currently dominated by energy industry concentrated between the hands of magician Alstorm and General Electric, two lords rather interested in other regions. Especially since the energy sector has changed and competition has become terrible. The concern is that these difficulties lead to a whole series of other problems. Magicians leaving, breweries closing, not enough work for hobbits. Plus, all these negative elements reinforce each other. From there, how do we get out of the vicious circle? My economist side will tell you that part of the solution is for the Comté to find new sectors to develop and allow it to relaunch its economy by diversifying it. But that's where it gets stuck. Heavily invested past, strong industrial memory, hobbits with hyper-specialized skills, which makes the rest of the story complicated. In other words, the Comté is blocked in a scenario. A scenario that was once positive but now ends up in a dead end. I want to understand what are the elements that prevent the Comté from diversifying its activity and what elements could help it change its trajectory. To do this, I will first operate a diagnosis of the territory through statistical mapping. But then, once you have a global vision of the difficulties and blockages of the territory, what do we do? To answer this question, I will study the assets and resources of the Comté by conducting interviews with hobbits. This will allow me to observe how they take charge of their destiny. Because yes, hobbits take charge of their destiny. You should know that there is a local ring community composed of captains of industry, elected officials, citizens, and trade unions, and gathered around common projects, public policies. My goal is to understand how this community functions, who its members are, what relationships they have with each other, and if the public policies they put in place allow the territory to engage in a new scenario. A very beautiful scenario.\n\nNote: The text appears to be an excerpt from a thesis on the economy of Middle-earth, written from the perspective of an economist. It uses fantastical elements from J.R.R. Tolkien's work as a metaphor for understanding the challenges faced by a region dependent on industry and how it can adapt to changing circumstances.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,362,9832,77492,88253,11,5019,9189,3327,72684,514,70927,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,91507,9189,15473,444,466,326,6,90446,64979,2428,294,22827,7317,6491,556,9047,22811,13,38891,89,1208,1219,123708,11,220,2636,8261,42138,1208,19814,409,326,6,20991,2933,13,4241,9425,11,3846,7317,6491,556,264,4635,84,1208,9517,65272,67965,6853,1880,74699,11,3625,5107,5512,409,326,6,485,592,7379,13,19421,272,17771,25945,52088,978,8637,2428,11,66021,1744,1120,1133,11,1208,1219,123708,1826,7591,3825,5048,409,326,6,485,592,7379,13,27058,23761,5636,51625,1082,11,1208,1219,123708,1826,1180,77776,11358,8047,1370,326,6,485,592,7379,409,326,31769,64374,1880,20662,9047,7379,1826,17576,8047,9465,3625,69236,3930,4983,3457,268,1708,27511,1880,3930,89175,98151,34395,11,26633,513,19388,1759,96308,92759,5512,1370,294,81979,38682,919,13,328,5757,412,1744,514,31237,12844,409,326,31769,64374,264,14707,2609,978,1880,1744,1208,3613,21201,1826,409,7287,17936,13,2009,5945,5979,11,272,17771,1744,27750,5107,5512,83786,25108,77,306,43905,6316,47528,294,81979,52088,66474,13,3959,4983,3457,729,7930,961,306,11,951,37138,4804,7930,68736,11,5636,79380,409,42775,5019,3625,69176,11777,13,2998,5636,11,26725,27750,33013,98942,308,19395,266,22589,513,5790,2000,1189,9465,84440,13,65381,31632,409,39015,11,4068,389,20272,5019,3460,404,3930,47562,273,32531,53819,949,445,31769,45317,17194,665,41091,11412,9189,13510,934,31109,48901,409,1208,6425,11,272,17771,1744,1208,1219,123708,71451,409,87325,31237,38647,3869,52895,716,1880,934,85217,25400,29557,73468,409,1375,11967,4538,82653,648,665,1208,21797,84554,13,34447,272,17771,39015,1744,39043,1080,1736,13,1611,326,414,5469,2793,15760,1392,1522,5512,11,6316,32118,97495,67965,6853,65058,11,951,69176,11777,10253,75332,2436,17508,76305,285,14014,11,39043,20272,1744,1208,16578,3930,48876,1826,4684,5118,8047,13,9648,55755,22011,11,1208,1219,123708,1826,14545,447,8047,7010,653,1156,10610,3370,13,1252,1156,10610,3370,7930,43989,47838,86633,20940,333,11,10071,7930,75804,88253,4751,483,7010,653,11957,6953,1355,582,13,6178,72,11,4864,5320,2249,60946,265,934,2053,15132,3625,33013,98942,7930,8654,5615,331,306,1208,1219,123708,409,21797,3125,4538,4197,13109,11,1880,3625,33013,98942,7930,11,8065,32150,556,11,5019,969,1188,326,26248,1814,3869,62439,409,9781,585,42827,13,27058,39043,11,4864,91507,294,6,370,541,1200,52424,653,15439,3930,7317,6491,556,77433,3869,6316,7558,3257,648,20719,2428,13,34447,4160,321,6496,11,6316,37291,934,54386,264,6316,11376,13509,1604,951,5107,5512,1880,951,41840,1154,3930,7317,6491,556,11,934,17771,54312,934,54386,20272,949,27058,75871,265,3869,20662,3488,11,4864,91507,14240,664,1291,3625,520,11934,1880,594,40751,409,1208,1219,123708,665,3026,519,951,1218,2171,80463,98544,81,12416,951,69176,11777,13,24703,7930,11412,757,29557,10367,294,6,31830,4068,46152,864,7521,306,28130,52087,665,1925,13,4366,346,1744,11,97507,11,3625,69176,11777,864,7521,306,28130,52087,665,1925,13,7695,47090,47929,934,35329,29253,6316,34561,94943,409,326,6,20991,2933,2254,11,40321,8047,409,61510,33903,294,6,485,592,7379,11,33013,355,11,6681,2303,729,1880,22013,292,1900,11,1880,9517,359,285,90053,409,22040,1441,1081,11099,11,951,3435,8467,78511,14295,13,3206,719,11,272,17771,409,60946,265,4068,20662,34561,94943,34501,818,11,7930,665,15132,15907,78957,11,26077,645,15132,43153,4398,9465,84440,11,1880,4502,3625,3435,8467,78511,14295,934,85217,2322,73468,665,2035,29557,73468,294,6,833,1435,514,7317,6491,556,7010,653,43453,1156,10610,3370,13,1252,25945,72006,1156,10610,3370,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,8586,374,279,11093,1495,512,198,15724,11,358,3358,3371,499,279,14964,3446,315,459,13076,18455,311,10552,279,3917,315,856,17850,13,38891,12877,86187,220,2636,1667,1306,279,19814,315,279,3861,22249,13,8876,1243,11,420,18455,706,10534,279,25563,22910,323,1457,12580,27129,304,5064,13,1628,430,596,1633,36033,1606,279,1219,123708,374,18222,389,5064,13,2057,387,810,24473,11,279,1219,123708,374,5131,30801,555,4907,5064,38626,1990,279,6206,315,90441,1708,27511,323,3331,21246,11,1403,90213,4856,8173,304,1023,13918,13,36625,2533,279,4907,10706,706,5614,323,10937,706,3719,17936,13,578,4747,374,430,1521,27129,3063,311,264,4459,4101,315,1023,5435,13,7023,9818,9564,11,73802,15676,11,539,3403,990,369,69176,11777,13,12623,11,682,1521,8389,5540,55414,1855,1023,13,5659,1070,11,1268,656,584,636,704,315,279,43510,12960,30,3092,46215,3185,690,3371,499,430,961,315,279,6425,374,369,279,1219,123708,311,1505,502,26593,311,2274,323,2187,433,311,1375,18930,1202,8752,555,21797,7922,433,13,2030,430,596,1405,433,5334,16075,13,1283,402,1570,29091,3347,11,3831,13076,5044,11,69176,11777,449,17508,93348,1534,7512,11,902,3727,279,2800,315,279,3446,17395,13,763,1023,4339,11,279,1219,123708,374,19857,304,264,15398,13,362,15398,430,574,3131,6928,719,1457,10548,709,304,264,5710,842,13,358,1390,311,3619,1148,527,279,5540,430,5471,279,1219,123708,505,21797,7922,1
