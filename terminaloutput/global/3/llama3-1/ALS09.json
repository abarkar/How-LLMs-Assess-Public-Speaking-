It appears to be a transcript of a thesis defense or presentation on the topic of selling and the impact of social media on traditional sales processes. Here's a breakdown of the text:\n\nThe speaker, Lauriane, begins by discussing how finding love requires going through multiple stages, just like selling. She outlines the classic sales process: prospecting for new clients, identifying potential buyers, setting appointments, highlighting product benefits, responding to objections, and closing deals.\n\nHowever, with the rise of social media, the traditional sales process has been disrupted. Instead of cold-calling or meeting prospects in person, salespeople can now reach out to them directly through private messages on social networks. This raises questions about whether the classic sales process is still relevant.\n\nLauriane then shares her research findings from interviews with salespeople who use both traditional and social media-based approaches. Some salespeople stick to the classical approach, while others incorporate social media into their strategies.\n\nThe speaker also introduces theoretical frameworks from institutional theory, which suggests that individuals can create, maintain, or destabilize existing practices. She uses examples of \"Tonton Albert\" (who maintains the status quo), \"Copine Léa\" (who creates a new process), and \"Petit Frère Tim\" (who disrupts the traditional approach) to illustrate these concepts.\n\nFinally, Lauriane hints at her future research plans, which involve identifying Tonton Albert, Copine Léa, or Petit Frère Tim types within companies and analyzing their actions to create, maintain, or destabilize sales processes. She invites the audience to consider whether they would be more like Albert, Tim, or Léa if they were responsible for shaping the future of sales.\n\nOverall, this text is an engaging presentation on the changing nature of selling in the digital age.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,1252,6335,665,19266,23985,9189,5534,1339,1744,5019,46524,326,58591,414,11,3900,47090,45347,1370,51854,14240,9521,13,62293,1647,88411,409,8518,1880,3625,9908,7330,333,8467,1744,503,34155,326,355,1765,514,70927,11,4864,94297,9189,13510,1744,5019,19189,265,11,272,17771,4839,1133,24068,321,13,7695,47090,46932,265,653,1920,355,409,74190,13,220,16,13,41621,12584,89,7010,653,31237,12844,11,88817,9211,409,87325,8403,11,22299,7010,653,3703,5019,91026,26077,447,22827,13,220,17,13,41621,3608,57609,89,653,3016,7930,9189,57110,22550,13,1856,332,35657,6502,8811,66090,2922,6496,13,220,18,13,41621,864,55506,66651,45325,13,13789,30362,11,41091,272,17771,54300,36135,13,2998,11943,8047,13,220,19,13,41621,2322,668,89,665,33670,26725,3625,33670,1154,409,15265,54206,13,14465,36731,46680,54149,11,30498,648,817,13,220,20,13,41621,9517,76149,89,3869,15907,54111,13,7695,47090,436,395,7889,514,3016,13,34447,2536,11,4864,73953,5636,3869,1647,506,13,220,21,13,12095,9189,62299,7970,11,9189,17782,89,3869,71139,1208,74190,13,25145,72,5019,8941,99077,13,220,22,13,4366,1208,16578,11,9189,1589,8047,89,6316,12976,409,1317,98020,13,16062,16081,11,66651,45325,3846,57992,11,220,777,71,8065,10960,13,34447,87320,274,6,9034,5615,466,3869,671,1382,26077,447,22827,7010,1208,34923,648,17536,4502,9189,308,6,52659,6502,409,74190,949,12095,389,25692,2167,1133,25400,6233,42219,653,1984,6223,978,1765,3625,9517,325,12249,949,19421,97507,11,9952,326,6,1138,344,8047,951,9517,325,12249,12288,83391,11,389,841,39904,5636,1370,40744,27750,14240,9521,13,8409,1339,54312,39587,1208,1913,3930,1920,355,409,74190,1880,3930,8518,949,27058,514,47929,11,503,34155,3026,978,951,1218,2171,80463,9952,951,95194,83391,13,15663,1771,42587,306,44093,514,1920,355,409,74190,538,2428,1880,294,81979,1081,27462,3869,75144,3625,9517,325,12249,12288,83391,13,4366,51173,11,5019,88817,9211,951,44827,1765,3625,8403,6033,5019,2800,261,665,3729,1370,951,29085,13,24703,7930,296,55624,978,22550,11,3846,15132,3625,48577,4294,4893,3930,2609,1133,294,31109,95234,14135,64829,3869,6316,48659,95234,13,5034,76680,30303,15244,64829,17317,1280,2428,1744,27750,48577,82133,296,804,951,6299,409,81939,11,409,5088,3675,6033,409,7591,267,13052,8082,13,13789,11,4864,296,6,30992,2428,13,27058,46524,326,58591,414,11,15265,6293,483,445,978,64,9189,31025,4618,294,6,14283,1765,6316,17537,72,409,10607,11,409,19266,1072,556,2167,1133,665,27912,51854,48577,409,27389,59958,16271,11,44829,409,3625,91026,665,83195,6033,6502,13,12095,389,17537,2428,3625,887,14014,409,445,978,64,7010,6316,93486,11,45602,5891,72,408,14687,3869,75831,653,43453,1920,355,409,74190,13,350,546,263,17971,11412,9189,13510,934,35329,308,26248,55455,409,64972,1744,294,6,14283,7010,653,3703,11,294,6,370,1382,1208,54613,11,409,1208,19266,1072,556,13,426,1116,11,22299,39043,274,17771,44093,81621,11,389,841,2349,55455,13,46706,6316,93486,11,350,546,263,17971,7625,2058,1339,5019,514,5088,3675,3930,1920,355,409,74190,13,650,52262,46110,1448,12339,9538,550,10515,408,934,54386,25692,25945,14707,39929,6316,12976,29121,1133,16099,1604,13,11697,35411,4864,259,26248,547,21965,90551,92174,13,9538,87264,25945,14707,13,9538,87264,66090,7930,7591,267,13052,1082,514,1920,355,409,74190,13,46706,1208,16578,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,91507,259,1992,294,6,16288,7930,15132,3625,350,546,263,17971,11,6293,483,445,978,64,6033,46110,1448,12339,9538,7010,6316,93486,13,14465,91507,3625,22842,11,28130,1153,261,951,4860,11,20028,951,1218,2171,80463,1880,46131,26077,645,15132,3625,6299,934,85217,82133,296,804,5019,75831,11,5088,268,404,6033,7591,267,13052,12329,514,1920,355,409,74190,13,19421,4502,326,6,5389,404,3930,8518,7591,3825,1339,409,9189,11,9189,33978,89,96308,17971,11,9538,6033,445,978,64,949,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,32,27387,1495,0,1102,8111,311,387,264,36815,315,264,17850,9232,477,15864,389,279,8712,315,11486,323,279,5536,315,3674,3772,389,8776,6763,11618,13,5810,596,264,31085,315,279,1495,512,198,791,19114,11,54300,36135,11,12302,555,25394,1268,9455,3021,7612,2133,1555,5361,18094,11,1120,1093,11486,13,3005,50729,279,11670,6763,1920,25,22199,287,369,502,8403,11,25607,4754,23455,11,6376,37256,11,39686,2027,7720,11,30438,311,54111,11,323,15676,12789,627,198,11458,11,449,279,10205,315,3674,3772,11,279,8776,6763,1920,706,1027,69627,13,12361,315,9439,1824,17157,477,6574,27949,304,1732,11,6763,16455,649,1457,5662,704,311,1124,6089,1555,879,6743,389,3674,14488,13,1115,25930,4860,922,3508,279,11670,6763,1920,374,2103,9959,627,198,43,4202,36135,1243,13551,1077,3495,14955,505,19905,449,6763,16455,889,1005,2225,8776,323,3674,3772,6108,20414,13,4427,6763,16455,9396,311,279,29924,5603,11,1418,3885,33435,3674,3772,1139,872,15174,627,198,791,19114,1101,40019,32887,49125,505,33232,10334,11,902,13533,430,7931,649,1893,11,10519,11,477,72257,553,6484,12659,13,3005,5829,10507,315,330,51,546,263,17971,1,320,14965,33095,279,2704,41608,705,330,57377,483,445,978,64,1,320,1
