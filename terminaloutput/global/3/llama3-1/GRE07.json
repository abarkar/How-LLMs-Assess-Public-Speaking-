Here's a summarized and translated version:\n\nThe bubbles in hydroelectricity are what the champagne is to a party. They're predominant. Sucked down by an underwater jet, they can be forced into a pressure pipe. As their volume decreases, they'll eventually explode just before the turbine and might damage it. But they also offer an easy way to visualize areas where the jet has a significant impact, typically downstream of a large dam. They're also formidable agents for transferring air into water. This provides optimal oxygen saturation for aquatic life, synonymous with good health.\n\nA model predicting bubble entrainment would allow us to answer what's happening with more and more gases in the water. I'll focus on three key issues: turbine health, dam health, and fish health. That's precisely my job. For each jet, I need to provide the amount of air entrained, the size of the injected bubbles, and their distribution by depth. Simple, you might think. Yes, but the problem is massive because in hydroelectricity, jets can fall from over 30 stories high with a flow rate comparable to the Rhine or Rh√¥ne rivers. A laboratory model won't give us reliable results. That's why I had to develop the world's largest experiment to see the jet, its fall, and its bubble cloud all at once.\n\nTo do this, I armed myself with high-frequency cameras. I developed an image processing algorithm that allows me to obtain the jet's state, speed, and movements at every point in its fall. This is something the human eye can't see. To understand what happens under the water surface, I equipped myself with optical probes made in Grenoble, which allow me to measure, count, and track bubble velocities. Thanks to these observations, I can better understand the mechanisms linking the jet to its fall.\n\nThere are also builderies (buildings?) at the base of the fall. The fall is an artistry. It's an artisanal craftsmanship. And so, that's how the secret of bubble formation was born. As for jets, I've seen all sorts - ones that fall straight down, ones that move in every direction, and completely exploded ones. Each one entrains air in its own way. That's why, for aquatic ecology and energy efficiency, I'm fully committed to cracking the code of the bubble.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,11876,7173,645,665,17055,978,47262,13109,15132,3846,1744,514,35641,22157,1826,3869,1208,282,37093,13,4072,645,15132,27389,3595,14081,15844,13,2998,2221,25108,77,14014,1370,653,17004,32592,1208,7479,409,326,93847,11,84568,56311,23761,296,5014,665,3577,290,7010,6316,76069,635,52842,8047,13,2009,324,8286,11412,45575,513,9517,1072,556,11,513,9517,1072,556,11,513,9517,1072,556,11,55398,81991,7684,805,1437,16382,1001,70374,32592,1208,66270,1880,35977,479,842,20372,1435,1208,5780,13,34447,84568,1022,8135,28463,6316,67239,978,51794,5019,9302,12329,6316,10353,39723,514,17004,264,653,5536,4698,50848,11,3666,81235,3869,326,6,22510,294,22827,6800,81690,13,4072,645,15132,28463,409,1376,307,4893,13307,409,20429,531,409,326,6,1334,7010,326,93847,13,4072,645,1022,8135,3869,1208,2267,2957,15715,266,2428,1208,50843,665,99690,70,48099,7706,1604,11,74450,68,409,51651,77323,13,1252,83597,29557,61512,409,550,15433,556,326,6,306,969,25108,40280,294,6,1334,3930,220,16,17004,29557,30532,665,653,74206,16081,409,75871,265,3869,3846,934,35329,379,264,409,5636,665,5636,409,56086,3869,326,93847,13,14465,91507,45347,56321,665,3841,2249,13,23746,978,951,76775,11,77323,951,6033,19456,1154,17055,978,772,462,14295,1880,73103,951,58883,38448,13,356,17771,51625,285,42625,326,6,67816,409,1647,42775,13,27058,46777,17004,11,4864,51441,23761,13171,409,81994,404,829,10484,13109,294,6,1334,83786,25108,52235,11,829,62827,409,7173,645,15921,14014,1880,28130,9517,42098,665,34501,409,1208,2848,17675,324,13,9170,11,757,13510,89,45325,13,507,2005,11,10071,514,80259,1826,409,62827,11,1841,665,17055,978,47262,13109,11,3625,44305,56311,10390,655,294,31109,6520,40095,409,5636,409,220,966,14240,1154,13,62293,653,7591,4590,30139,3869,66090,3930,18452,258,6033,3930,18452,9769,818,13,1252,83597,9517,47348,665,9511,67763,841,29557,6502,294,6,677,2002,404,951,100246,282,2205,82,13,356,17771,87320,3900,264,4498,84,1744,4864,2322,668,8065,1486,1208,5636,25626,1367,14081,3904,367,8065,38900,5019,46131,514,17004,11,829,95480,1880,4538,11148,425,409,7173,645,665,6316,86806,37291,13,27058,45602,11,4864,757,36731,6916,978,409,6730,978,13075,3869,81098,1448,978,4474,13,622,34155,68866,978,653,89714,409,1208,6730,76743,3869,81098,1448,978,4474,13,356,17771,653,89714,294,78337,7930,757,29557,11,665,16968,1486,409,1208,95480,3930,17004,11,294,6,677,2002,404,4538,14240,266,11,829,348,87960,1880,15907,54409,12760,13,24703,1744,326,6,52822,321,2854,467,841,25692,6502,46131,13,27058,60946,265,3846,7930,513,39904,32592,1208,7479,409,326,93847,11,4864,757,36731,94616,978,409,47937,288,3469,8467,11,1903,304,39224,51093,11,7930,29557,73468,409,11083,7889,3625,7173,645,11,409,3625,55056,261,1880,294,6,677,2002,404,39015,28463,28130,348,87960,13,2895,66096,3869,27750,24654,11,4864,94297,64972,60946,265,3625,32118,4919,2191,288,7930,908,306,514,17004,3869,1208,95480,13,14465,94297,28463,60946,265,3625,32118,4919,2191,288,7930,908,306,514,17004,3869,1208,95480,13,14465,94297,28463,60946,265,3625,32118,4919,2191,288,7930,908,306,514,17004,3869,1208,95480,13,7695,379,264,28463,951,1977,4804,7930,14848,24560,20272,288,665,3122,409,1208,95480,13,5034,95480,1826,6316,67219,278,13109,13,46408,1826,6316,67219,278,13109,13,46408,1826,6316,67219,278,13109,13,46408,1826,6316,67219,278,13109,13,46408,264,4538,10648,409,7173,645,13,19421,44351,11,272,17771,93029,978,514,6367,409,1208,4415,24918,951,7173,645,13,19421,951,44305,11,503,41901,16796,33614,409,40744,3460,288,13,423,12416,934,85217,44180,306,16968,64079,13,423,12416,934,85217,30870,16149,7010,26725,3625,6225,13,423,12416,934,85217,15132,4684,4558,79507,14218,5512,13,19421,95917,359,294,6,40997,84440,83786,25108,818,409,326,6,1334,3869,829,85722,13,1708,1105,272,17771,87320,11,5019,326,6,20243,38469,951,7625,53819,15715,266,8467,1880,326,6,6581,292,582,13109,4046,39624,99188,11,4864,36731,7245,38284,11,1880,4684,4558,79507,2995,351,978,3869,23828,261,1208,7173,273,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,32,36815,922,44783,304,17055,64465,2410,11012,0,5810,596,264,69729,323,25548,2373,512,198,791,44783,304,17055,64465,488,527,1148,279,65393,374,311,264,4717,13,2435,2351,96531,13,328,40458,1523,555,459,46474,17004,11,814,649,387,9770,1139,264,7410,13961,13,1666,872,8286,43154,11,814,3358,9778,16135,1120,1603,279,66270,323,2643,5674,433,13,2030,814,1101,3085,459,4228,1648,311,51187,5789,1405,279,17004,706,264,5199,5536,11,11383,52452,315,264,3544,3824,13,2435,2351,1101,54829,13307,369,51051,3805,1139,3090,13,1115,5825,23669,24463,50843,369,72491,2324,11,69593,449,1695,2890,627,198,32,1646,52997,24529,11751,73712,1053,2187,603,311,4320,1148,596,12765,449,810,323,810,45612,304,279,3090,13,358,3358,5357,389,2380,1401,4819,25,66270,2890,11,3824,2890,11,323,7795,2890,13,3011,596,24559,856,2683,13,1789,1855,17004,11,358,1205,311,3493,279,3392,315,3805,11751,2692,11,279,1404,315,279,41772,44783,11,323,872,8141,555,8149,13,9170,11,499,2643,1781
