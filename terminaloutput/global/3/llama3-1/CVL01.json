The speaker, likely a researcher or educator, is discussing their thesis on how sign language can help students with hearing impairments and those with learning difficulties, such as dyslexia and dysphasia.\n\nThe speaker starts by asking a question, \"Loi niche bas, la poule niche haut, mais o√π niche hibou?\" which translates to \"Do the law and the hen sleep low, but where do the owl sleep?\" The purpose of this seemingly absurd question is to illustrate how sign language can help clarify misunderstandings and improve comprehension.\n\nThe speaker goes on to explain that sign language is a powerful tool for accessing the meaning of spoken discourse. By using sign language in conjunction with oral communication, students can better understand what the teacher is saying, reducing confusion caused by homophones (words that sound the same but have different meanings) and paronyms (words that are similar but have different definitions).\n\nThe speaker also notes that sign language can be particularly helpful for students with dyslexia or dysphasia, as it provides a visual representation of spoken language. This can help students with these learning difficulties to better comprehend and remember information.\n\nThroughout the presentation, the speaker uses examples and anecdotes to illustrate their points, including a humorous aside about how they use sign language in their own classroom to aid memory retention.\n\nThe final question, \"Inichu ibu?\" which translates to \"Where does the owl sleep?\", is likely meant to be a rhetorical question, as it is unclear what the answer would be. The speaker then concludes by thanking the audience and ends with a sense of enthusiasm for the potential benefits of using sign language in education.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,445,2852,53070,1474,6870,9189,1153,261,6316,86806,1880,4382,3488,13,6621,72,35149,3122,11,1208,17258,273,35149,62321,11,10071,39723,35149,305,581,283,949,1708,1105,949,13789,11,4864,9517,79,66522,13,6621,72,35149,3122,11,1208,17258,273,35149,62321,11,10071,39723,35149,305,581,283,949,16770,11,272,17771,64972,22299,39043,11,2536,949,445,6496,11,503,34155,42587,978,6316,13033,31037,7930,9189,264,14175,285,409,64972,60946,265,3846,1744,4864,834,2852,13,19421,20662,13033,31037,11,272,17771,1208,96282,951,1879,288,13,19421,272,17771,39015,514,70927,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,3206,95920,1744,1208,96282,951,1879,288,1826,653,704,321,281,15433,55180,2428,665,37417,13,46408,11412,29557,10367,665,67781,294,26248,1814,3625,33013,4558,2396,1218,29410,3869,64972,917,43711,71,1693,3625,46430,1056,1154,1880,3869,64972,60946,265,3846,1744,22011,326,6,1137,59110,13,2998,67781,11,409,13026,4881,14240,29246,14848,1647,376,978,1744,1208,13033,31037,29557,83,1339,294,69537,978,1126,8065,6225,3930,2624,2530,13,5034,96282,951,1879,288,14240,519,6316,96282,13033,31037,11,4502,653,68061,59110,1879,68,665,27584,27138,934,35329,21308,1082,4538,45369,11,326,6,19010,79351,60946,969,64972,3846,7930,1826,22011,13,356,8458,51913,2058,64,39587,3625,2389,36807,409,78199,1880,409,6225,11,22299,37953,447,54386,665,1826,3663,3869,951,5105,7987,288,11,951,78199,7930,14848,1208,27584,78605,685,11,6033,87158,326,54386,1826,3663,3869,951,1370,7987,288,11,951,78199,7930,513,594,28111,306,10071,7930,308,6,546,6502,1208,27584,47371,4144,11,259,2053,1744,6666,6033,14944,13,4366,51173,11,4502,4864,62163,3869,653,33013,79351,409,757,21273,10670,653,297,1082,2933,7930,121839,11,3900,11412,409,779,72,98375,13510,1744,272,17771,653,297,1082,2933,7930,121839,13,7695,11412,409,779,72,98375,13510,1744,272,17771,653,297,1082,2933,7930,121839,13,7695,11412,409,779,72,1744,4864,841,25400,62163,6502,409,757,21273,10670,653,297,1082,2933,7930,121839,11,7930,7591,33936,11,10071,653,297,1082,2933,7930,121839,13,4418,66,11,1208,96282,951,1879,288,11412,2536,71686,23761,8791,458,5019,3625,33013,4558,2396,1218,29410,22709,2635,8467,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,3625,33013,4558,2396,7930,14848,951,5945,79155,409,13550,978,71,2711,1880,7930,14848,3930,8811,3869,44178,63934,1291,76076,78199,463,8696,11,10071,11412,44767,91878,3625,33013,4558,2396,1218,29410,22709,51480,8467,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,66056,7930,14848,653,12544,3930,8859,425,21308,13,2998,20272,11,272,17771,22299,4502,4864,44314,2852,9952,3625,32592,2442,275,417,665,27584,27138,13,356,17771,78422,532,13,356,17771,78422,532,11,2536,949,1611,5636,11,7010,7643,37417,11,503,34155,18757,84228,16339,1744,1208,96282,951,1879,288,12576,1339,3869,1208,296,17060,269,8082,46206,3625,33013,4558,2396,1218,29410,13,23097,375,41881,45325,11,9189,11,42676,9189,14240,74466,86696,11,42676,389,9189,44453,1339,951,1615,625,288,11,389,42587,1339,12155,69236,13,2009,46110,3920,867,354,7930,60172,829,47276,79828,11,9189,665,7477,375,41881,949,61651,14707,11,272,17771,77433,10253,13033,288,13,1883,9484,265,6316,3273,5512,648,77433,3869,1208,96282,951,1879,288,11412,39587,23761,653,91116,5636,31914,580,1880,5636,296,17060,45860,2428,5019,3625,33013,4558,2396,1218,29410,13,34447,1913,54960,11,294,3695,1474,6870,11,12769,763,718,84,19185,84,8345,949,61651,14707,11,12769,358,20218,308,819,13080,297,13080,13081,8345,949,12769,358,20218,308,819,13080,297,13080,13081,8345,949,14465,9189,312,1195,25134,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,791,36815,8111,311,387,264,15864,477,8982,922,279,1005,315,1879,4221,439,264,10696,55180,950,5507,304,58216,13,578,19114,11,4461,264,32185,477,72146,11,374,25394,872,17850,389,1268,1879,4221,649,1520,4236,449,11011,38974,1392,323,1884,449,6975,27129,11,1778,439,22709,2635,689,323,22709,764,36259,627,198,791,19114,8638,555,10371,264,3488,11,330,4357,72,35149,3122,11,1208,17258,273,35149,62321,11,10071,39723,35149,305,581,283,7673,902,48018,311,330,5519,279,2383,323,279,48916,6212,3428,11,719,1405,656,279,53369,6212,7673,578,7580,315,420,23490,32677,3488,374,311,41468,1268,1879,4221,649,1520,38263,90700,826,323,7417,62194,627,198,791,19114,5900,389,311,10552,430,1879,4221,374,264,8147,5507,369,32888,279,7438,315,22066,41602,13,3296,1701,1879,4221,304,32546,449,21308,10758,11,4236,649,2731,3619,1148,279,11326,374,5605,11,18189,22047,9057,555,5105,5237,3233,320,5880,430,5222,279,1890,719,617,2204,50800,8,323,1370,46703,320,5880,430,527,4528,719,617,2204,17931,570,198,198,791,19114,1101,8554,430,1879,4221,649,387,8104,11190,369,4236,449,22709,2635,689,477,22709,764,36259,11,439,433,5825,264,9302,13340,315,22066,4221,13,1115,649,1520,4236,449,1521,6975,27129,311,2731,58389,323,6227,2038,627,198,60105,279,15864,11,279,19114,5829,10507,323,94066,311,41468,872,3585,11,2737,264,70946,16038,922,1268,814,1005,1879,4221,304,872,1866,24978,311,12576,5044,38231,627,198,791,1620,3488,11,330,644,718,84,191
