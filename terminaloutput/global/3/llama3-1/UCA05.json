{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-11-19T12:45:31.228365928Z","response":"Here is the combined text:\n\nWe all have an Uber-like application on our smartphones, such as Uber Eats, Deliveroo, or Fedora. These small applications are fun, easy to use, but do you realize that behind them are workers? These workers are presented by the platform as independent contractors. They are also known as freelancers. Being independent means escaping the fundamental criteria of employment contracts, which is juridical subordination.\n\nThis subordination has been a game-changer since the end of the 19th century and was originally designed to discipline factory workers. Today, it has changed and now compensates for the submission of employees by opening up new avenues for them. This means that juridical subordination regroups the powers of control, sanctions, and direction that an employer exercises over their employee.\n\nNow, if I tell you that freelancers are independent, it means they don't see any imposition of these powers of control, sanctions, and direction. But is this really the case? Are there no indications of juridical subordination in the relationships between freelancers and platforms?\n\nThat's where my thesis comes in, aiming to analyze these work relationships and, when these freelancers are not as independent as they seem, to bring them back to the origins of salaried labor. The problem is that the platform model has already struggled. It now takes the form of a pyramid.\n\nAt the top, there's a platform that exercises authority. Below, you have freelancers, such as delivery workers, who have obtained some sort of promotion and are themselves authorities. And then you have companies that provide equipment for rent, which also exercise authority. At the very bottom, you have a final freelancer who is subject to the authority of the three upper levels of the pyramid.\n\nSo, is this final freelancer subordinated? No, because the dispersal of powers among the hands of the three upper levels of the pyramid prevents the platform from taking control. And there's also formal recognition of juridical subordination.\n\nWhat do we do then? We'll look for a right in our legal corpus that could accommodate these relationships of control, domination, and power. And there is one: it's the competition law. My idea is to take this competition law and insert a part into labor law.\n\nThe ultimate goal is to offer protection to this not-so-independent worker. And open up the right to labor law protection for them. Thank you.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,48109,57038,26725,7010,12155,36122,6316,3851,409,955,28712,11,28712,469,1900,11,65752,2689,6033,80606,13,62463,98385,8522,11,84568,15132,45064,8467,11,84568,15132,3547,3742,294,6,97675,11,10071,47592,45325,42563,1744,2761,65220,513,61387,306,951,42775,77660,949,62463,42775,77660,11,46152,15132,57485,5512,1370,1208,12235,76701,22299,14240,519,951,1280,978,3825,1821,13,1952,3625,917,6853,44767,951,23095,93551,10253,91653,13,1717,232,10367,1280,978,3825,519,11,39043,76605,13510,75249,949,64105,64,76605,13510,934,54386,4046,331,34531,10253,4742,31539,21901,2908,12249,3930,88103,409,42775,11,7930,1826,1208,1207,99344,16422,307,2428,13,62408,1207,99344,16422,307,2428,11,272,17771,653,51655,1448,292,467,13,46408,2457,409,1208,1913,3930,1630,5511,68,1880,27549,50590,24560,23423,8047,3869,326,6,4775,483,5019,15869,10670,3625,6033,85,17740,409,1208,25626,9047,7379,13,362,9832,77492,88253,11,1208,1207,99344,16422,307,2428,264,14707,2609,978,44829,447,80720,86100,14573,261,1208,5945,2796,3930,4371,2850,978,665,25400,6033,19456,519,514,29340,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,1207,99344,16422,307,2428,11,27549,513,47371,2381,22299,1239,896,519,3625,17258,3415,17260,409,6155,57332,409,24679,1880,409,5216,934,22827,3539,12844,7591,668,396,1765,4538,4371,2850,978,13,1708,1105,76826,11,4502,4864,9189,834,1744,3625,23095,93551,10253,91653,15132,1280,978,3825,1821,11,39043,76605,13510,934,85217,841,4160,1188,6502,274,98279,20672,1765,84440,27750,17258,3415,17260,409,6155,57332,409,24679,1880,409,5216,13,34447,1826,54312,60019,514,4865,949,452,59858,264,2442,57375,85624,57182,409,1207,99344,16422,307,2428,7010,3625,4398,9465,23095,93551,10253,91653,1880,12235,76701,949,19421,503,41901,5891,80463,3869,1208,3488,409,1208,1207,99344,16422,307,2428,13,356,17771,39015,1744,326,6,1735,333,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,7930,348,1082,3869,8678,805,27750,4398,409,42775,1880,11,87158,27750,23095,93551,10253,91653,841,15132,6502,19227,1001,1280,978,3825,1821,1744,39043,11,3869,3625,45712,261,5553,326,6,4775,483,3930,4371,41979,13,2009,80259,11,272,17771,1744,514,83597,12235,76701,264,46939,326,21493,978,13,423,5512,494,2852,11,3846,83597,1826,32592,57128,47897,1604,13,33150,1794,4150,11,389,264,6316,12235,76701,7591,73468,23994,409,326,49455,269,13109,13,2998,21273,788,11,389,264,951,23095,93551,10253,91653,11,1370,51173,951,56984,1759,11,7930,40142,1188,4615,1509,6316,80444,409,20862,1880,7930,40142,1188,4615,1509,6316,80444,409,20862,13,19421,84440,28463,15132,85877,6960,1759,294,49455,269,13109,13,33150,8348,13532,25253,14240,425,409,20662,4611,2453,579,11,389,38831,83384,951,15983,10515,5512,409,3813,409,86374,22811,7930,44767,15132,85877,24677,1238,294,49455,269,13109,13,19421,16968,665,3122,11,389,264,653,23095,66749,10253,91653,1620,7930,513,4160,275,917,24332,326,49455,269,13109,951,56321,6954,4918,14240,1154,409,1208,4611,2453,579,13,1708,1105,11,3846,23095,66749,10253,91653,1620,1826,54312,934,35329,1826,1207,22231,52235,949,61651,14707,2536,11,66021,1744,326,31769,1768,79,321,1001,951,17258,3415,17260,9465,3625,69236,951,56321,6954,4918,14240,1154,409,1208,4611,2453,579,8654,5615,1557,1208,312,9868,409,1208,12235,76701,13,19421,3900,264,28463,1208,88605,294,31109,1207,99344,16422,307,2428,1376,6853,13,1708,1105,11,934,17771,54312,934,54386,20272,949,61651,14707,11,389,11412,48908,23008,9211,7010,29449,43194,16422,307,2428,653,64079,7930,44521,1339,18757,1645,444,3458,66014,409,15907,4398,409,6155,57332,11,409,55949,1880,409,68226,13,19421,3900,308,41901,1826,934,22827,11,272,17771,514,64079,409,1208,3613,21201,13,19421,1647,887,8047,11,272,17771,409,59394,514,64079,409,1208,3613,21201,1880,294,6,1354,52424,6316,48901,5553,514,64079,3930,42775,13,445,6,1735,333,1620,11,272,17771,75249,949,356,17771,294,6,1885,38315,6316,9313,3869,3846,42775,36077,6502,60019,1280,978,3825,519,13,19421,28130,6033,63346,64079,3869,1208,9313,3930,64079,3930,42775,13,14465,9189,312,1195,25134,13,25145,72,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,8586,374,279,11093,1495,512,198,1687,682,617,459,28712,12970,3851,389,1057,36122,11,1778,439,28712,469,1900,11,65752,2689,11,477,80606,13,4314,2678,8522,527,2523,11,4228,311,1005,11,719,656,499,13383,430,4920,1124,527,7487,30,4314,7487,527,10666,555,279,5452,439,9678,33840,13,2435,527,1101,3967,439,32231,32842,13,21347,9678,3445,53754,279,16188,13186,315,14740,17517,11,902,374,16422,307,950,1207,99344,627,198,2028,1207,99344,706,1027,264,1847,11843,4091,2533,279,842,315,279,220,777,339,9478,323,574,13517,6319,311,26434,8803,7487,13,11450,11,433,706,5614,323,1457,14573,988,369,279,21142,315,8420,555,8736,709,502,73234,369,1124,13,1115,3445,430,16422,307,950,1207,99344,1239,89510,279,13736,315,2585,11,24679,11,323,5216,430,459,19683,23783,927,872,9548,627,198,7184,11,422,358,3371,499,430,32231,32842,527,9678,11,433,3445,814,1541,956,1518,904,94879,315,1521,13736,315,2585,11,24679,11,323,5216,13,2030,374,420,
