Here's the English translation of the transcript:\n\nDid you know that even reinforced concrete bridges can fall ill? In other words, what's the difference between a reinforced concrete bridge and the human body? It's obvious that inside the human body, there is a skeletal structure. On the other hand, in reinforced concrete, there is an iron framework. Imagine a bone disease like it was. When bones are weakened and no longer fulfill their role, the body becomes weakened. In the same way, in reinforced concrete, this disease is corrosion. Corrosion of steel rebar is caused by two aggressive agents: carbon dioxide, which is abundant in the atmosphere, and chloride ions present in seawater and marine shadows. These agents try to penetrate the concrete until they reach the iron rebar. Once corrosion begins, rust forms, grows, and makes the concrete explode. It creates significant fissures on the bridge. I'll let you imagine the consequences.\n\nMy work consists of developing tools to help engineers predict and anticipate the risk of corrosion in reinforced concrete structures. These tools are mathematical models called engineering models. They're called that because they're adapted to the direct concerns of construction industry professionals. The peculiarity of these models is that they're both easy to use and cost-effective in terms of calculation time, while being precise.\n\nBut now things get complicated. I'm interested in predicting the initiation phase of corrosion first. This phase corresponds to the duration it takes for the aggressive agents to reach the rebar level. This duration depends not only on environmental conditions (temperature, relative humidity, and concentration of aggressive agents) but also on the concrete's ability to delay their penetration. This ability is translated into performance indicators: the CO2 diffusion coefficient and the chloride ion migration coefficient. For example, for a high-temperature concrete, the service life is 100 years. The current regulations assume that the structure's lifespan ends once corrosion begins. Without making the parallel, humans are considered dead when they're sick. Which isn't true in general.\n\nThe peculiarity of my research work is to integrate the propagation phase of corrosion into the structure's lifetime. This duration is allowed for a small opening of 0.1 mm. A small scar. At this stage, the mechanical performance of the bridge is not affected. The risk of the structure collapsing becomes major only when corrosion reaches advanced stages. You've understood well. The final goal of my research work is to help and guide engineers in optimizing and maximizing the lifespan of reinforced concrete structures. This lifespan often exceeds the average lifetime of a simple researcher like us. And this creates frustration. But also hope that today's bridges, built with today's techniques, will hold up tomorrow. Tomorrow won't be there.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,20680,74466,45325,1744,27584,3625,37194,82,665,90551,783,6916,978,56311,10390,655,8811,3536,949,9648,55755,22011,11,74940,1826,1208,44178,16271,9465,653,37194,665,90551,783,6916,978,1880,514,34922,2854,467,949,356,17771,4046,1325,306,11,3869,326,55624,57663,3930,34922,2854,467,11,3900,379,264,6316,6070,2709,325,817,11,514,32232,10010,13,350,438,285,1744,7010,514,90551,783,6916,978,11,3900,379,264,6316,31159,1598,665,1645,1291,13,38891,89,6316,8811,329,648,2709,325,817,259,6853,934,80720,45441,13,46706,3846,4865,11,3625,2709,15132,8508,121038,5512,1880,841,82133,6502,69241,404,28130,436,57332,13,4366,1615,978,17187,11,514,34922,1826,3611,64,69713,13,46706,514,90551,783,6916,978,11,20662,8811,329,648,2709,325,817,1826,1208,56488,13,5034,56488,951,6916,2859,665,1645,1291,1826,4245,3869,326,6,1617,20234,1370,26633,13307,945,676,22589,13,2009,65570,4223,451,409,1841,20337,7930,1826,671,2159,519,7010,326,6,266,8801,764,12339,1880,3625,65125,37833,1439,7930,15132,30179,812,7010,326,93847,409,4809,1880,3625,297,3172,417,3869,90215,13,62463,13307,945,676,22589,16006,306,409,281,32453,95920,7010,514,90551,783,55398,81991,93381,71933,326,6,2227,1598,294,6,54553,13,39783,37291,1208,56488,45265,66,8047,11,1208,29465,4618,513,57128,11,27549,513,64592,69,273,1880,20272,4046,566,977,514,90551,783,13,46408,1589,8047,951,95159,22166,75419,1765,514,37194,13,14465,9189,93569,6669,10670,3625,1615,978,45045,13,3206,42775,6824,68,3869,52895,716,951,704,8839,5019,91878,3625,6892,10610,46138,3869,550,15433,556,1880,16961,261,514,10025,593,409,56488,7010,3625,6033,19456,1154,665,90551,783,6916,978,13,62463,704,8839,15132,951,1491,85798,7033,978,8637,8467,934,54386,917,6853,951,1491,85798,6892,10610,46138,13,1952,3625,917,6853,44351,66021,934,85217,15132,10737,5512,10253,27389,24719,811,2167,288,951,67965,2053,409,426,4334,13,5034,4040,13109,409,27750,1491,85798,1826,294,93825,3869,1208,37291,4382,294,100017,11,28800,1080,60768,519,665,4751,288,409,27138,409,5935,1880,51625,285,13,34447,272,17771,74699,39723,3625,79165,513,4684,5118,306,13,14465,296,55624,978,22550,7010,653,21134,27138,3869,550,15433,556,1208,10474,294,6,2381,7246,409,1208,56488,13,62408,10474,8024,3869,1208,10878,8047,1744,3625,13307,945,676,22589,2322,73468,5019,2961,1553,8065,53052,409,326,6,2227,1598,13,62408,10878,8047,7591,3825,2536,71686,951,4787,294,58736,3571,11,2798,14081,1598,11,2854,3748,978,8844,1880,20545,951,13307,945,676,22589,7010,326,41901,2842,40280,11,10071,44767,409,1208,23878,13109,3930,90551,783,3869,77072,261,28130,281,32453,376,367,13,62408,23878,13109,1826,4790,9486,1370,951,13519,1759,409,5178,13,2009,36706,409,7591,13311,409,7432,17,1880,514,36706,294,6,17060,5141,951,65125,37833,554,2249,13,4366,51173,11,5019,653,90551,783,3869,81098,2798,14081,1598,11,1208,10878,8047,409,5178,1826,409,220,1041,8261,13,5034,38682,1001,367,1180,31037,23289,1744,1208,10878,8047,409,2532,294,22827,6033,19456,425,1826,93381,46429,6316,37291,1208,56488,45265,66,8047,13,15089,20272,514,1370,543,51453,11,326,6,28400,467,1826,77554,68862,10237,6316,37291,8811,1037,13,24703,7930,308,17771,6502,83195,11,665,89175,13,5034,4040,13109,409,11083,58673,2249,409,38317,1826,294,55624,978,911,261,1208,10474,409,54743,409,56488,7010,1208,17536,409,326,6,283,19456,425,13,62408,10878,8047,1826,39674,14081,8047,5019,6316,6033,65930,409,282,434,554,409,220,15,11,16,9653,13,39783,38920,54877,68636,13,362,3846,357,1037,2922,6496,11,3625,24601,32118,4919,8467,3930,37194,841,15132,6502,5916,14014,13,2009,10025,593,409,326,6,6581,2159,55755,409,326,6,283,19456,425,3567,1188,296,11305,324,71686,42676,1208,56488,93381,396,951,357,3536,1860,1149,5512,13,41621,326,6,52659,14707,13550,285,13,5034,1620,13109,409,11083,58673,2249,409,38317,1826,294,26248,1814,1880,409,1709,1814,3625,6892,10610,46138,409,76407,3869,7706,12329,1880,31127,12329,1208,10878,8047,409,2532,951,6033,19456,1154,665,90551,783,6916,978,13,62408,10878,8047,87885,13559,71151,326,6,25632,14081,685,409,17536,3930,4382,52571,324,1744,17317,74533,13,19421,272,76832,1589,8047,6316,33086,13,34447,44767,653,1560,5481,404,5019,1744,3625,37194,82,294,6,2933,69572,88253,19477,12059,9952,3625,12823,294,6,2933,69572,88253,9165,89810,514,9880,13,2009,9880,841,35737,5636,39015,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,27387,8712,0,5810,596,279,6498,14807,315,279,36815,512,198,7131,499,1440,430,1524,49680,14509,40073,649,4498,5986,30,763,1023,4339,11,1148,596,279,6811,1990,264,49680,14509,14497,323,279,3823,2547,30,1102,596,8196,430,4871,279,3823,2547,11,1070,374,264,69397,6070,13,1952,279,1023,1450,11,304,49680,14509,11,1070,374,459,11245,12914,13,38891,264,17685,8624,1093,433,574,13,3277,25896,527,58764,323,912,5129,21054,872,3560,11,279,2547,9221,58764,13,763,279,1890,1648,11,304,49680,14509,11,420,8624,374,56488,13,4563,3714,290,315,9699,312,2308,374,9057,555,1403,19738,13307,25,12782,40589,11,902,374,44611,304,279,1
