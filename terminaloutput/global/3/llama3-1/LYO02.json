It appears to be a conversation or lecture about the nature of human consciousness and the way we navigate our lives. Here's a breakdown of the main themes:\n\n1. **The fragmentation of life**: The speaker describes how people with Alzheimer's disease lose their sense of orientation, getting lost in their own existence. This serves as an analogy for how we all navigate through fragments of our own lives, without necessarily questioning or understanding how we do it.\n2. **The concept of \"continuity\"**: The speaker likens the way our consciousness moves through mental spaces (thoughts, goals, activities) to the physical movement of our body through physical spaces (locations, buildings). This highlights the idea that our experiences are interconnected and form different continuities that intersect and overlap over time.\n3. **The study of perception, memory, and cognition**: The speaker is conducting research on how we perceive, remember, and manage these various continuities in our lives. They use video games as a reduced-scale model to investigate how participants adapt to changes, recall past events, and project into the future.\n4. **Understanding brain mechanisms**: The goal of this research is to better understand how our brains work, allowing us to make the most of their capabilities. This could lead to improved management of complexity, increased creativity, or a deeper understanding of mental problems.\n5. **The importance of self-awareness**: The speaker notes that it's possible to live and accomplish things without fully understanding how we function. However, they argue that having some level of self-awareness can help us imagine what we could achieve if we better understood the workings of our own minds.\n\nOverall, this transcript presents a thought-provoking exploration of human consciousness and the ways in which we navigate our lives.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,41621,3665,89,11,3625,48577,7930,14848,1208,8811,329,648,294,6,2149,42360,11,84568,308,6,1138,81541,5636,3869,14707,274,6,15226,261,13,4072,645,513,41518,306,7010,28130,83187,14209,13,34447,17317,11,4068,1826,54312,934,54386,20272,5019,513,38831,15170,7010,29449,14209,11,665,20272,949,356,17771,19227,1001,7138,75,934,54386,841,829,275,6502,60019,13,1952,34512,361,7010,3625,35603,409,29449,14209,11,15878,21965,513,1153,261,409,4860,11,8065,1652,2727,13,4366,51173,11,39015,11,70374,33670,409,96586,49733,11,95917,359,294,6,40997,17317,66517,1339,47838,14896,13,24703,7930,308,26248,55455,3869,46131,9952,3846,7930,513,39904,49733,13,19421,42676,389,961,9008,294,6,3457,11,389,6348,64,26725,67807,84,84595,79071,14896,294,49455,265,7010,29449,17536,13,1611,1208,27584,85722,1744,29449,34922,513,7591,2050,7010,653,1560,1330,64441,11,40321,978,409,10457,2249,11,409,293,64272,12843,11,409,4371,645,11,7010,3625,447,37907,3900,25692,48908,1880,19443,404,11,29449,42563,513,7591,2050,7010,653,1560,1330,10723,11,40321,978,409,924,75004,409,23423,8047,11,409,719,82,11,294,6,9035,35933,11,294,6,21843,78,3946,11,7010,3625,447,37907,27549,11412,1880,5891,1188,11,409,80444,3869,4846,96642,2018,3159,5512,7930,513,14425,285,306,1880,7930,513,67807,84,81541,11,3869,30517,514,27138,13,62463,2018,3159,5512,7010,3625,447,37907,29449,1560,40807,11412,1880,5891,1188,11,27750,2018,3159,5512,1744,326,54386,2322,665,18579,1880,1744,326,54386,312,59976,5636,62197,11,1370,86633,48488,5636,62197,11,42676,389,38831,83384,653,52827,934,54386,308,26248,6502,33614,41199,951,65838,11,1370,51173,11,272,17771,3846,1765,75249,653,51655,42775,273,13,622,6,26577,648,409,60946,265,4068,389,20272,5019,18434,265,951,348,552,15890,514,76354,1826,4502,12569,978,1880,1218,1864,5615,69328,7010,514,27138,13,12535,389,20272,5019,18434,265,51854,98385,348,552,32118,5317,14014,7010,6316,27584,17536,11,665,79071,80444,949,622,57286,664,648,26725,3625,32118,4919,2191,288,409,21063,11,409,32118,97495,11,5906,665,51655,7010,1208,59471,409,27750,2018,3159,5512,11,409,27750,98385,348,552,13,27058,3846,20028,11,4864,14843,285,3869,6316,4046,331,6853,9517,1072,635,1208,88452,409,29449,17536,3869,30517,951,70175,57146,1744,4864,390,68453,13,36684,13324,28068,306,3869,51854,70175,85114,11,46777,51655,91678,519,6316,2018,3159,978,13,65381,31632,409,39015,11,4864,14951,1130,951,1719,75104,5019,44178,63934,1291,3625,70175,1880,4864,84921,1208,23878,13109,951,13324,409,274,6,20311,10253,2609,3808,409,51655,11,409,513,98395,409,3846,7930,274,17771,81621,11,409,513,22040,1430,7010,514,18111,324,11,1880,28130,21063,3930,27138,13,80905,39043,5019,60946,265,4068,64972,45712,261,79988,951,32118,4919,2191,288,409,29449,272,5976,2933,11,1744,3846,45441,5019,64972,342,52424,1208,6485,13109,14425,1056,5048,409,12155,348,552,11,5019,35881,455,1565,29449,34280,20053,13109,11,6033,5019,64972,60946,265,76076,52088,66474,11540,12249,13,1952,25692,25945,14707,18434,265,1880,9465,59976,265,84871,409,79165,15878,60019,60946,265,4068,389,34501,818,13,24703,308,17771,6502,100243,13,19421,9465,17317,11,272,17771,42676,27584,79380,57625,42676,389,379,9517,1517,978,331,275,11,2536,949,423,22827,47838,81337,11,4502,389,50590,63669,409,60946,265,4068,389,34501,818,5019,1081,20099,3869,18434,265,11,389,308,6,4202,1339,56316,59062,978,1880,389,841,87264,6502,39015,13,4366,346,1744,272,3433,10333,1474,6870,11,389,42182,513,272,34858,1208,83067,5019,60946,265,3846,7930,513,39904,7010,29449,83067,13,356,8458,22011,11,4502,389,17782,3869,20028,16968,3846,934,54386,17782,3869,20028,15878,60946,265,4068,389,20272,11,10071,6669,10670,3846,934,54386,92215,20028,4502,389,60946,64972,16968,3846,7930,513,39904,39015,2902,2784,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,32,27387,36815,0,1102,8111,311,387,264,10652,477,31678,922,279,7138,315,3823,25917,323,279,1648,584,21546,1057,6439,13,5810,596,264,31085,315,279,1925,22100,512,198,16,13,3146,791,88452,315,2324,96618,578,19114,16964,1268,1274,449,44531,596,8624,9229,872,5647,315,17140,11,3794,5675,304,872,1866,14209,13,1115,17482,439,459,56203,369,1268,584,682,21546,1555,35603,315,1057,1866,6439,11,2085,14647,34685,477,8830,1268,584,656,433,13,198,17,13,3146,791,7434,315,330,22025,35594,1,96618,578,19114,3208,729,279,1648,1057,25917,11031,1555,10723,12908,320,61665,82,11,9021,11,7640,8,311,279,7106,7351,315,1057,2547,1555,7106,12908,320,32409,11,14016,570,1115,22020,279,4623,430,1057,11704,527,83416,323,1376,2204,16513,1385,430,32896,323,28347,927,892,13,198,18,13,3146,791,4007,315,21063,11,5044,11,323,75310,96618,578,19114,374,31474,3495,389,1268,584,45493,11,6227,11,323,10299,1521,5370,16513,1385,304,1057,6439,13,2435,1005,2835,3953,439,264,11293,13230,1646,311,19874,1268,13324,10737,311,4442,11,19635,3347,4455,11,323,2447,1139,279,3938,13,198,19,13,3146,71251,8271,24717,96618,578,5915,315,420,3495,374,311,2731,3619,1268,1057,35202,990,11,10923,603,311,1304,279
