{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-11-19T12:48:57.073331502Z","response":"This is a transcript of a presentation given by someone about their research on the relationship between neuropathy and diabetic foot ulcers.\n\nThe presenter starts off by introducing themselves and explaining that they are going to present some information about their thesis on this topic. They then go on to describe how nerves transmit pain messages from the feet to the brain, and how people with diabetes can experience nerve damage (neuropathy) that affects this process.\n\nThe presenter explains that neuropathy can cause people to not even realize they have a stone in their shoe or a blister because the nerves are no longer functioning properly. This can lead to delayed treatment and potentially serious complications.\n\nThey then go on to describe their research, which involved reproducing diabetic foot ulcers in a laboratory setting and studying how they heal compared to wounds in people with healthy nerve function.\n\nThe presenter reveals that one of the surprising findings from their study was that even when nerves are damaged by neuropathy, they can still transmit signals during times of crisis, such as when an ulcer forms. However, these signals are not being received by the affected cells because they have stopped paying attention to the signals transmitted by the damaged nerves.\n\nThe presenter concludes by summarizing their findings and suggesting that any treatment for diabetic foot ulcers should aim to restore the ability of cells in the skin to receive signals from the nerves, rather than just trying to heal the ulcer itself. They end with a question mark, implying that more research is needed to fully understand this complex issue.\n\nOverall, this transcript appears to be a presentation on a specific research topic, and it seems to be aimed at an academic or medical audience.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,5019,757,30179,1992,3869,9189,3846,57992,13,14465,757,36731,5906,1765,1647,220,2148,13,622,34155,5906,951,8374,2439,13,19421,503,34155,8811,10253,44630,82,13,24703,15132,3625,41283,3933,7010,1208,1069,2933,409,11083,44630,82,7930,665,3415,1188,514,1984,409,1208,25595,36077,55398,81991,1647,272,5976,2933,13,19421,9189,11,3900,1826,4068,514,2267,1088,58797,949,7695,1826,653,28800,10878,949,24703,15132,3625,41283,3933,7010,1208,1069,2933,409,26317,282,65970,7930,9189,514,834,306,13,62463,41283,3933,15132,22299,951,23672,288,409,426,26691,6007,7930,17317,304,2000,479,665,11885,768,409,3846,7930,513,39904,90053,409,17317,13,8560,75876,43765,11,3738,288,48577,841,312,20822,81541,5636,326,6,26125,13,2009,1759,41283,3933,15132,653,28800,7591,5192,102504,1220,13,356,17771,3846,934,54386,917,6853,1208,98666,589,648,13,81245,56311,39929,653,2211,484,283,7010,1208,13826,1892,554,1880,841,27584,6502,274,41901,98054,42463,13,5034,5353,409,20662,98666,589,648,11,514,1891,370,66522,11,16968,3846,924,846,7010,514,29340,7930,55517,7010,514,34922,55398,81991,1208,1069,2933,272,640,19010,1082,46110,3869,46110,3625,41283,3933,13,19421,27750,48577,7930,14848,3930,1891,370,66522,1880,6316,98666,589,648,14848,665,5636,14707,71151,653,8725,66,12339,11,6316,40852,648,2848,17675,7010,1208,1069,2933,7930,841,54877,266,32609,6502,14707,13,1952,841,829,275,6502,87320,13,19421,4502,389,841,60946,6502,11,389,841,25692,6502,52895,716,951,9781,1224,812,31914,2492,5019,779,78756,27750,6978,13,3298,77776,11,46152,15132,14707,71151,1097,631,5512,294,22827,220,16977,321,11,3930,44630,11,4160,556,409,1208,20673,1395,13,6178,72,11,503,6,434,61055,409,60946,265,3846,80259,409,54877,266,6091,367,13,5034,55133,14240,2070,264,24560,409,14843,556,665,9511,67763,653,8725,66,12339,409,1208,1069,2933,11,19227,934,35329,513,54206,8065,21901,409,1208,13826,1892,554,13,386,19010,853,409,282,4744,79507,11,409,3577,290,1880,294,6,28400,307,13109,13,39783,16287,13109,11,296,26248,22011,7643,2167,23994,409,270,4558,325,13,64105,64,296,26248,52579,653,459,13,1252,459,1880,93128,13,2998,51092,11,503,34155,7809,978,1208,54877,266,6091,367,409,42067,8725,66,12339,7010,6316,1069,2933,9952,951,41283,3933,1880,7010,6316,1069,2933,9952,951,41283,3933,7591,5192,102504,1220,1370,514,1891,370,66522,13,622,34155,20272,951,550,19010,4558,12760,1880,14240,21178,978,3625,32118,4919,2191,288,6160,1640,8467,5906,665,51655,13,24703,934,54386,23423,1339,11,272,17771,934,6,88423,1208,98666,589,648,11,27750,23672,288,7591,5192,102504,1220,97958,7010,326,6,2910,391,582,13109,409,34561,72684,13,12095,14707,1744,1208,2849,1130,409,1069,2933,11,67475,6960,259,19010,5512,1002,68636,409,426,26691,6007,11,308,49152,1339,71357,6502,3625,3754,40744,6816,25108,8696,13,24703,1744,503,34155,59148,1653,42844,7643,270,4558,325,11,272,17771,934,41901,3044,409,65396,11,22299,37953,447,35329,379,264,653,8725,66,12339,11,27750,41283,3933,7591,5192,102504,1220,38831,283,688,326,6,1354,29579,1880,34561,5118,306,3869,43453,4669,28130,9622,1435,1760,978,2428,6290,22394,13,1883,301,3869,40744,3625,2849,2482,409,1069,2933,10253,453,306,2530,409,1208,10353,7589,3843,8047,5019,96586,665,41675,13,24971,409,9517,1335,13,1708,1105,11,39723,1826,514,80259,949,61651,14707,11,1208,2849,1130,409,1069,2933,11,41199,514,27138,11,264,65147,978,409,5363,261,426,26691,6007,13,46408,841,274,17771,27584,5636,1131,4068,38682,1565,4538,3276,26193,43116,13,46706,1647,14240,799,11,514,9517,1512,12844,31819,3444,556,18302,375,220,16,13,46408,841,25692,5636,2215,35573,326,6,26125,1880,841,9517,74972,6502,3869,1208,65396,13,19421,1208,40852,648,66167,90551,5048,8065,39381,409,513,8464,1195,13,11583,270,4558,325,513,1913,275,1880,4864,308,34155,6502,31807,44906,3625,52088,66474,409,10758,9465,3625,41283,3933,1880,1208,1069,2933,13,34447,3846,934,54386,829,275,3869,57485,11,272,17771,1744,514,89714,5019,3625,8725,66,31539,46206,3625,1891,370,10515,8467,3567,969,20028,665,80444,1744,1208,2849,1130,409,1069,2933,45441,3869,43453,13171,409,2107,466,514,8450,13,25145,72,13,58945,8039,15760,1392,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2028,374,264,36815,315,264,15864,2728,555,4423,922,872,3495,389,279,5133,1990,98666,19682,323,71975,4579,8725,17254,627,198,791,34756,8638,1022,555,33018,5694,323,26073,430,814,527,2133,311,3118,1063,2038,922,872,17850,389,420,8712,13,2435,1243,733,389,311,7664,1268,50581,30382,6784,6743,505,279,7693,311,279,8271,11,323,1268,1274,449,20335,649,3217,32015,5674,320,818,84,897,19682,8,430,22223,420,1920,627,198,791,34756,15100,430,98666,19682,649,5353,1274,311,539,1524,13383,814,617,264,9998,304,872,30077,477,264,81792,1606,279,50581,527,912,5129,31301,10489,13,1115,649,3063,311,23540,6514,323,13893,6129,36505,627,198,7009,1243,733,389,311,7664,872,3495,11,902,6532,14843,6253,71975,4579,8725,17254,304,264,27692,6376,323,21630,1268,814,27661,7863,311,34254,304,1274,449,9498,32015,734,627,198,791,347
