Here is my attempt to combine and translate the text:\n\n\"The Ulysses' journey, the path of state that his name signified 'man of pain', is one of obstacles that he must overcome one by one. And now, social economy, the evolution of social economy, it's very important. The dynamics of social economy evolve very quickly, and Maresex will carry out a contribution on social economy in Europe.\n\nThis means that today's environment is not good for social prices, and social prices do not have much data to create a favorable commercial environment. This means that it's impossible to find the contribution. Maresex will carry out a study of balances and indicators to find the contribution between social economies and prices.\n\nWhy social economy? One month ago, an agreement was signed between Australia and France. This means the production of all submarines offering 100 jobs over 10 years. This is horrible! What's happening? Imagine an economy that composes 20% of social enterprises, which would translate into a 40% reduction in taste for the final product. This means an economy that's very important and competitive.\n\nSo, we think that if there's a very important social economy, using these indicators will allow us to spend on the future and give a reconciled vision of economic drifts... it's not... it's over.\"\n\nPlease note that some parts may still be unclear or require further context due to the incomplete nature of the transcript.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,356,17771,514,45640,294,6,52,61492,325,11,4160,648,294,6,27887,68238,1744,4538,9859,1879,333,689,275,40351,409,25595,36077,11,3625,32116,7930,274,6,83336,306,77558,25400,1880,934,35329,8508,275,3625,7120,42138,3625,46106,13,19421,74699,326,31769,45317,648,75107,11,326,31769,65272,409,326,31769,45317,648,75107,11,272,17771,25945,3062,13,11876,18003,2191,288,409,326,31769,45317,648,75107,4046,12821,11942,25945,100198,1880,64898,11814,2700,2473,1208,19035,1765,326,31769,45317,648,75107,7010,326,6,31880,732,8458,76605,13510,1744,326,41901,2842,40280,294,6,2933,69572,88253,11,3900,308,17771,6502,7970,5019,3625,38847,12288,83391,1880,3625,38847,12288,83391,308,6,546,6502,48488,409,46681,5019,75831,653,50026,40280,8518,37849,13,356,8458,76605,13510,934,35329,308,17771,6502,3284,409,46524,1208,19035,13,64898,11814,2700,2473,1208,19035,409,326,31769,45317,648,75107,665,14240,41939,3625,20934,598,951,38847,1880,665,26483,77282,3625,13519,1759,5368,818,37291,27750,13519,1759,3073,306,11,4864,46524,2192,1208,19035,9465,3625,82653,552,65207,1880,3625,38847,13,19421,74699,11,87320,326,31769,45317,648,75107,30,7695,379,264,653,46415,11,3900,264,24560,1879,978,653,14902,9465,326,52374,5523,648,1880,1208,9822,13,356,8458,76605,13510,1208,59251,409,26725,3625,32592,71098,1354,7930,1022,8135,220,1041,8654,385,285,1765,220,605,65838,732,8458,76605,13510,28201,13,3489,17771,54312,7930,513,39904,30,38891,89,6316,82653,648,7930,31435,220,508,4,951,97263,65207,1880,45602,4790,21581,1339,7010,220,1272,4,6316,9517,23985,409,733,60768,7010,514,54206,1620,13,356,8458,76605,13510,6316,82653,648,25945,36897,1880,75332,3486,9833,1105,11,17317,23423,2439,1744,274,35329,379,264,6316,82653,648,75107,25945,36897,11,665,42587,519,27750,13519,1759,11,45602,17317,87885,1137,3869,326,6,5389,404,1880,3869,71751,6316,11376,9517,41546,4008,8047,951,7591,81,1924,82653,8467,1880,1131,272,17771,6502,1131,272,17771,10415,978,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5084,1093,499,617,3984,264,36815,315,459,7274,477,264,8982,304,8753,11,449,1063,5596,7554,477,25420,4245,311,279,37666,13,5810,374,856,4879,311,16343,323,15025,279,1495,1473,10227,549,398,784,288,6,11879,11,279,1853,315,1614,430,813,836,1879,1908,220,2846,276,315,6784,518,374,832,315,32116,430,568,2011,23075,832,555,832,13,1628,1457,11,3674,8752,11,279,15740,315,3674,8752,11,433,596,1633,3062,13,578,30295,315,3674,8752,38680,1633,6288,11,323,64898,11814,690,6920,704,264,19035,389,3674,8752,304,4606,627,198,2028,3445,430,3432,596,4676,374,539,1695,369,3674,7729,11,323,3674,7729,656,539,617,1790,828,311,1893,264,37849,8518,4676,13,1115,3445,430,433,596,12266,311,1505,279,19035,13,64898,11814,690,6920,704,264,4007,315,39954,323,34824,311,1505,279,19035,1990,3674,37671,323,7729,627,198,10445,3674,8752,30,3861,2305,4227,11,459,9306,574,8667,1990,8494,323,9822,13,1115,3445,279,5788,315,682,86642,10209,220,1041,7032,927,220,605,1667,13,1115,374,28201,0,3639,596,12765,30,38891,459,8752,430,470,8449,220,508,4,315,3674,40919,11,902,1053,15025,1139,264,220,1272,4,14278,304,12945,369,279,1620,2027,13,1115,3445,459,8752,430,596,1633,3062,323,15022,627,198,4516,11,584,1781,430,422,1070,596,264,1633,3062,3674,8752,11,1701,1521,34824,690,2187,603,311,8493,389,279,3938,323,3041,264,32545,2230,11376,315,7100,34738,82,1131,433,596,539,1131,433,596,927,1210,198,198,5618,5296,430,1063,5596,1253,2103,387,25420,477,1397,4726,2317,4245,311,279,33243,7138,315,279,36815,13,128009],"total_duration":10328803547,"load_duration":168921,"prompt_eval_count":394,"prompt_eval_duration":789080000,"eval_count":321,"eval_duration":9539114000}
