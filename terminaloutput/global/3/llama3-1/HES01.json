{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-11-19T12:59:50.462327263Z","response":"The transcript appears to be a spoken text, likely from a scientific conference or presentation, where the speaker is discussing their research on material fatigue and prediction of failure.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the main points:\n\n1. The speaker introduces themselves as someone who studies materials and has developed a new numerical tool to predict the tolerance and point of rupture for a new material that will be used in future car components.\n2. They explain that they are interested in understanding why materials can \"get tired\" or \"lose their temper\" when they reach their tolerance limit, just like humans do.\n3. The speaker describes an experiment where they exposed a small sample of the new material to water and humidity, observing how it responds to stress and fatigue.\n4. They explain that the material initially resists the water and humidity but eventually reaches its tolerance limit and fails or \"cracks\" under pressure.\n5. The speaker highlights the importance of understanding this process at a microscopic scale (micrometers) in order to predict when these cracks will form and become dangerous.\n6. They also mention the need to consider other factors beyond just humidity, such as daily use (e.g., opening and closing doors) that can contribute to material fatigue.\n\nThe rest of the transcript appears to be an enthusiastic and slightly humorous summary of the speaker's research and goals for their new tool, which aims to predict when materials will fail or become dangerous before a disaster occurs.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,362,19610,45325,46939,33614,653,5634,28154,2933,7930,274,31769,1215,588,30,41621,12584,89,757,13510,653,5634,28154,2933,841,274,31769,1215,588,6502,30,507,2005,13,423,69537,541,13,34447,3846,1744,4864,5320,2249,13510,934,41901,20272,653,5634,28154,2933,37953,447,80720,93381,396,4538,20607,321,409,39674,14081,685,3869,653,3738,4545,11,3900,92215,274,6,9600,3212,22299,17317,11,3625,20183,45632,2854,1771,13,6178,72,1370,51173,11,3900,379,264,653,4545,8065,1647,20607,321,409,39674,14081,685,1826,93381,396,11,4864,36709,11,4864,296,31769,1215,588,1880,503,308,6,4683,1497,13,1252,5634,28154,2933,3900,274,6,9600,547,28463,11,3900,513,36709,1880,3900,513,5052,97717,13,34447,87320,4864,9189,1370,273,409,16968,39043,30,4366,346,1744,41091,503,57286,664,648,11,4864,52895,375,653,35462,704,321,1661,78129,7930,757,29557,409,27389,35573,514,20607,321,409,39674,14081,685,1880,514,1486,409,89869,294,22827,43453,5634,28154,2933,7930,31605,2473,514,10095,265,1880,1208,60172,951,4160,42204,409,18111,324,13,46706,514,9511,67763,39723,4864,42775,273,11,934,17771,54312,1744,4864,66517,30,622,6,15824,285,653,46110,4411,346,2933,409,3846,5634,28154,2933,1880,4864,514,66517,18434,265,7010,653,50026,40280,39723,9189,45366,9189,38831,15170,9952,15265,81645,7010,76076,21935,11,653,951,281,3946,326,6,28400,307,13109,13,4418,66,4864,296,1441,7010,326,93847,1880,1744,20272,326,93847,30,5034,4160,321,6496,7930,8175,265,11,27549,281,46651,1880,27549,281,46651,13,19421,1744,20272,514,5634,28154,2933,30,7695,31807,17194,11,3900,308,41901,25692,5636,13,393,9425,3900,93381,396,272,729,978,409,409,39674,14081,685,13,19421,8065,25646,294,22827,3738,4545,11,3900,46141,593,11,4864,91507,13510,3900,18111,97717,11,6033,96308,3900,5568,8065,9314,97717,66021,1744,39043,841,513,4160,275,6502,13,19421,272,17771,3846,1744,503,57286,664,648,1208,42723,97717,11,66021,1744,326,6,31258,1744,4864,52895,375,757,29557,2221,294,6,14283,3869,6316,4046,331,6853,25945,38920,409,326,6,541,265,409,19748,442,99746,54401,409,757,7591,68019,26725,27750,1156,10610,10308,409,84364,13,34447,9604,10333,11,3900,308,59858,264,6502,1744,39043,7010,1208,17536,11,66021,934,41901,5636,409,326,6,28400,307,13109,409,11323,266,11,9189,6033,85,23577,9189,18728,1195,15265,60172,13,41621,6033,85,23577,9189,18728,1195,15265,10095,265,13,41621,6033,85,23577,9189,18728,1195,15265,60172,13,41621,6033,85,23577,9189,18728,1195,15265,10095,265,1880,503,6,283,49606,13,14465,18728,2727,1880,503,6,283,49606,11,4864,18728,2727,1880,503,6,283,49606,11,4864,18728,2727,1880,503,6,283,49606,11,4864,18728,2727,1880,503,6,283,49606,11,4864,18728,2727,1880,503,6,283,49606,13,14465,18728,2727,13,426,1116,11,9189,326,65496,9189,514,36709,89,13,19421,39015,3625,95159,1439,1081,27462,3869,513,46131,13,19421,1208,1913,308,17771,6502,25945,78060,13,1708,1105,4068,20028,30,356,17771,39015,1744,1208,26633,90272,48901,409,1647,704,321,86953,1188,9952,3625,4046,447,811,409,1208,38094,648,64441,1880,32118,4919,2428,1744,4864,1491,19010,1082,7010,1647,1515,78493,13,14465,94297,45347,409,326,31769,331,6853,8162,2445,454,2428,3869,326,31769,331,6853,8162,2445,454,2428,54401,409,27389,35573,3869,26077,4545,3625,95159,1439,7930,3073,306,294,31109,76407,304,118904,15729,7010,653,5634,28154,2933,3567,26584,58612,486,4881,33670,934,22827,1377,373,841,513,2558,1082,13,4366,346,1744,41091,11,4864,5320,2249,1744,39043,1913,275,14707,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,791,36815,8111,311,387,264,22066,1495,11,4461,505,264,12624,10017,477,15864,11,1405,279,19114,374,25394,872,3495,389,3769,36709,323,20212,315,8060,627,198,8586,596,264,31085,315,279,1925,3585,512,198,16,13,578,19114,40019,5694,439,4423,889,7978,7384,323,706,8040,264,502,35876,5507,311,7168,279,25065,323,1486,315,89869,369,264,502,3769,430,690,387,1511,304,3938,1841,6956,13,198,17,13,2435,10552,430,814,527,8173,304,8830,3249,7384,649,330,456,19781,1,477,330,1497,872,6940,1,994,814,5662,872,25065,4017,11,1120,1093,12966,656,13,198,18,13,578,19114,16964,459,9526,1405,814,15246,264,2678,6205,315,279,502,3769,311,3090,323,38193,11,46071,1268,433,31680,311,8631,323,36709,13,198,19,13,2435,10552,430,279,3769,15453,594,1705,279,3090,323,38193,719,9778,25501,1202,25065,4017,323,14865,477,330,5192,7977,1,1234,7410,13,198,20,13,578,19114,22020,279,12939,315,8830,420,1920,520,264,90090,5569,320,21914,442,2481,8,304,2015,311,7168,994,1521,45963,690,1376,323,3719,11660,13,198,21,13,2435,1101,6420,279,1205,311,2980,1023,9547,7953,1120,38193,11,1778,439,7446,1005,320,68,13,70,2637,8736,323,15676,14365,8,430,649,17210,311,3769,36709,627,198,791,2800,315,279,36815,8111,311,387,459,42702,323,10284,70946,12399,315,279,19114,596,3495,323,9021,369,872,502,5507,11,902,22262,311,7168,994,7384,690,3775,477,3719,11660,1603,264,21426,13980,13,128009],"total_duration":10079010770,"load_duration":229491,"prompt_eval_count":706,"prompt_eval_duration":1431589000,"eval_count":287,"eval
