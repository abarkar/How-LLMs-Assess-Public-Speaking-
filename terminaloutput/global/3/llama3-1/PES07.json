Here's my attempt to summarize the main points:\n\n**Combining texts:** The speaker discusses the possibility of surviving on Mars (as shown in Matt Damon's movie \"Survivre sur Mars\") and applies this concept to our current situation on Earth, where we're facing climate change. They argue that just as astronauts need to adapt to a hostile environment, we must also adapt to the challenges posed by climate change.\n\n**Renewable energy:** The speaker highlights the importance of transitioning from fossil fuels (which are non-renewable) to renewable sources like plant-based materials. By using these resources, we can reduce our carbon footprint and mitigate climate change.\n\n**Biosourced materials:** As a chemist, the speaker has developed a process for creating 100% biosourced materials by extracting molecules of interest from plant-based sources, modifying them chemically, and assembling them into a rigid material with enhanced mechanical properties. This innovation has the potential to replace fossil fuel-derived materials in construction.\n\n**Fiber reinforcement:** The speaker emphasizes the importance of using recycled fibers to strengthen these new materials, making them more resistant and suitable for use in sustainable construction projects.\n\n**Innovative approaches:** The speaker highlights the value of exploring unconventional sources, such as orange peels or sunflower stalks, which are currently underutilized. By valorizing these waste products, we can create new, eco-friendly building materials.\n\n**Conclusion:** The speaker emphasizes that this transition to a biosourced, sustainable future is not just an option but a necessity. We must change our approach and mindset to address the challenges of climate change and ensure a livable future for generations to come.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,29878,84595,1765,21725,1826,3284,13,11876,91806,1439,409,13678,73349,514,20605,8135,14707,13,7695,2322,665,99225,61480,40744,15907,74282,1056,3095,7330,333,8467,5019,259,1992,409,23589,265,74206,1765,6316,3197,66522,33615,13,19421,4502,17317,2322,83,919,12155,9045,665,34561,5019,27389,4120,1208,86806,3197,66522,1765,1208,88265,17317,18434,2439,26725,949,65381,326,6,75876,1180,31037,11,17317,1207,285,38448,514,2609,1133,11323,266,2428,1880,513,2482,3625,4197,35933,2854,33903,15132,665,7643,66014,665,5353,11,81186,29449,82620,7930,513,19477,3159,4043,306,13327,1001,1765,326,100017,3930,281,10515,5898,11,7930,1826,294,6,52009,1759,6316,594,2484,4046,5701,82585,13,8242,1677,466,42067,665,3841,84,841,25692,23761,5636,4684,76366,1744,1208,63922,668,409,7550,648,409,42067,23112,6863,1088,13,12095,17317,348,11206,2439,326,6339,45973,514,9517,6583,1386,1133,11323,266,2428,11,3900,47090,513,3127,52424,409,3846,3941,409,82620,1880,6223,321,19395,1291,96308,326,100017,951,594,40751,5790,283,899,4893,19227,645,1744,3625,5634,59307,294,6,4775,483,348,19395,10515,1604,13,12095,17317,5363,2439,3625,22337,20243,2482,4819,3930,281,10515,5898,11,389,71451,934,6,37907,15132,18525,91640,31605,14014,294,6,266,20969,294,6,67229,70,48099,1880,409,1841,20337,13,4366,45973,11,3625,22337,20243,2482,4819,3930,38900,348,19395,10515,278,15132,31605,14014,294,6,266,20969,294,6,67229,70,48099,1880,409,1841,20337,44767,11,10071,1391,1466,77,306,665,5636,326,6,61263,70,48099,13,62408,44178,16271,1826,100243,13,7695,1826,4043,306,13327,409,59394,665,77554,53301,5019,7706,12329,1208,9320,13,2998,37622,1744,38094,17194,11,1647,1665,333,1826,294,6,370,541,409,90194,1208,594,2484,5790,283,899,481,11,294,6,15824,556,3625,22337,20243,2482,294,55624,14081,49530,11,409,3625,23575,38094,81235,11,54401,409,68226,3625,89624,1880,4846,653,5634,28154,2933,220,1041,4,49554,30463,1339,978,13,1611,20662,76407,11,4864,1323,2050,514,1841,20337,294,6,4775,483,26495,458,1370,3930,1841,20337,348,19395,10515,278,7930,1826,5790,283,899,481,13,445,6,300,28111,425,409,27750,22337,20243,2482,8065,53052,409,28130,1486,409,10607,757,29557,294,6,677,2002,404,6316,18112,22337,978,3395,12267,665,56321,15696,7930,33956,57609,514,54206,1620,13,34447,33670,1208,18488,409,3846,5634,28154,2933,11,951,16178,417,92465,14014,15132,92528,412,14014,54401,409,5790,83110,43153,21744,10515,5512,32118,4919,8467,1880,39587,409,98054,514,5634,28154,2933,5636,31807,11451,13,62463,86374,4298,2249,5019,9598,45575,23761,42587,5512,665,37622,1744,86374,4298,2249,6033,70477,1634,409,6070,5019,1208,8246,27220,13,13678,73349,264,2665,13532,3625,30584,9004,409,88026,11,294,6,52009,1759,3625,67965,2053,28463,44829,447,54386,3625,38831,83384,26725,7010,3625,2307,76,1132,5512,9952,3625,11347,82,665,23442,263,13,6178,72,11,503,34155,2665,13532,294,81979,348,19395,978,2629,2249,13,622,34155,2665,13532,409,14448,12329,3625,7591,331,1441,409,326,6,485,592,7379,38450,12267,22299,1208,1069,2933,294,6,35264,1370,51173,11,6033,35597,951,22337,20243,2482,7930,56311,23761,11741,1339,288,409,1208,259,7404,951,6136,288,22299,514,259,3514,288,337,7930,3869,3846,9880,308,17771,6502,14448,69068,13,362,32384,11,3869,31632,409,27750,26633,28271,11,3625,30584,9004,409,88026,15132,665,5542,409,513,9517,1338,12329,13,19421,665,34501,951,81336,15433,4167,11,3900,1826,3284,409,19477,52750,1208,39973,409,2486,467,13,2998,67781,11,3625,6954,59307,57705,978,6091,811,4571,8467,8065,9511,67763,14848,1647,376,978,1744,27750,86374,4298,2249,220,1041,4,49554,414,66,5512,15132,7809,4893,3869,43153,4046,447,4023,812,2425,355,409,1208,281,10515,299,331,318,648,13,7695,841,274,6,74972,6502,409,46524,951,10105,5019,9517,62219,3625,7591,70,9011,2641,1744,17317,57038,25540,5512,11,10071,96308,409,62439,29449,11376,409,20028,3625,79165,13,3341,20662,9320,1826,6316,63846,13109,13,25145,72,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,27387,36815,0,5810,596,856,4879,311,63179,279,1925,3585,1473,9,9,37292,5859,22755,68063,578,19114,35434,279,13336,315,40746,389,21725,320,300,6982,304,13678,73349,596,5818,330,63443,84595,1765,21725,909,323,17208,420,7434,311,1057,1510,6671,389,9420,11,1405,584,2351,13176,10182,2349,13,2435,18046,430,1120,439,69522,1205,311,10737,311,264,33615,4676,11,584,2011,1101,10737,311,279,11774,37260,555,10182,2349,382,9,9,35725,365,481,4907,68063,578,19114,22020,279,12939,315,73194,505,31376,40373,320,8370,527,2536,5621,943,481,8,311,33268,8336,1093,6136,6108,7384,13,3296,1701,1521,5070,11,584,649,8108,1057,12782,43972,323,50460,10182,2349,382,9,82439,3614,54492,7384,68063,1666,264,8590,380,11,279,19114,706,8040,264,1920,369,6968,220,1041,4,49554,54492,7384,555,60508,35715,315,2802,505,6136,6108,8336,11,47141,1124,8590,2740,11,323,81759,1124,1139,264,33956,3769,449,24872,22936,6012,13,1115,19297,706,279,4754,311,8454,31376,10633,72286,7384,304,8246,382,9,9,37,8799,72378,68063,578,19114,66159,279,12939,315,170
