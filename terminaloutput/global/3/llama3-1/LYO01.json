He discovers fire and venerates a star that bestows light and heat upon him. From flint to the interrupter, we are all in search of this glow. And although its understanding seems banal today, there still exist certain phenomena of light that elude us. Take for example a piece of sugar. Have you ever tried to break it in the dark? No? Yes? No? Well, I'm going to try to convince you. The phenomenon in question is called mechanoluminescence. Under mechanical action, some materials like sugar are capable of emitting flashes of light. Flashes that can be red, green, or even blue. And we call these materials phosphores. I am trying to identify the mechanisms responsible for the emission of light and understand how this phenomenon can be repeated infinitely. And as a bonus, I think about how to integrate them into our clothing. Imagine it: you find yourself in the dark, you don't have your phone on you, but there, you rub your T-shirt which emits enough light for you to see. But we could go even further and exploit this phenomenon to create sensors. To create sensors capable of detecting cracks in bridges or buildings. And thus prevent collapses from happening. And that's what we're doing. And that's what we're doing. But before getting there, you know it, it has to pass through the laboratory stage. And my research is divided into two stages. The first is preparing samples. And the second is optical characterization. I start by making my mechanoluminescent material. And for that, I follow a recipe that allows me to obtain a material with particular properties. Among these properties are the emission wavelength, which is the color emitted, the grain size, but also the crystal structure, which is the way my atoms are organized in my material. I mix my ingredients, put my preparation into shape, grind it to get powder, and I have my phosphor. My samples are the mixture of this powdered phosphor with PDMS, which is a polymer or a plastic, if you prefer. I obtain strips that are easy to deform, and I can move on to the next phase. This one consists in mechanically constraining my samples. With a motor, I stretch my strips, then release them, and record the light emitted. I get information like intensity of light as a function of the constraint applied. In other words, it tells me the most effective way to get maximum light. So, I imagine that some of you will still try to break sugar at home tonight, not? Just be careful, because among friends, it can make quite a few sparks. Thank you.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,4241,9425,44093,11,326,6,87713,52571,3869,274,6,15824,556,409,326,6,5598,2407,13109,13,7695,59148,49606,514,82711,1880,348,10610,12339,653,12025,265,7930,25400,14814,22711,41263,20712,1880,523,61047,13,16062,274,458,87,3869,326,55624,10802,12844,11,17317,74533,26725,3869,1208,38317,409,20662,326,79623,13,19421,14707,1744,829,13550,978,71,2711,97487,75804,88253,9120,1604,11,3900,29253,35597,76076,1343,98078,4558,4978,409,41263,20712,7930,17317,4046,331,680,306,13,5075,55506,1370,51173,653,4411,346,2933,409,924,846,13,362,19610,45325,46939,9071,978,409,514,272,34858,7010,514,56662,949,11842,949,507,2005,949,11842,949,13789,13,6178,72,11,4864,91507,4043,1155,409,9189,5804,467,846,13,2009,1343,98078,48099,15890,3900,1826,3488,274,53149,6853,1208,32118,4919,1152,1572,36634,13,89578,1957,32118,4919,2428,11,76076,86374,4298,2249,22299,514,924,846,15132,2107,4893,294,31769,4150,10367,951,62385,409,41263,20712,13,3959,62385,7930,56311,23761,29465,4282,11,60514,6033,27584,12704,355,13,19421,389,917,6853,27750,86374,4298,2249,2922,6496,951,33088,4692,13,6178,72,11,503,6,26577,648,294,6,16288,3625,32118,4919,2191,288,7930,15132,3869,326,6,4775,483,409,326,31769,2796,409,41263,20712,1880,409,60946,265,4068,3846,1343,98078,48099,25692,23761,9517,79,39883,3869,326,52152,5589,72,13,19421,665,12306,11,4864,9517,1517,978,331,285,3869,1208,85722,409,3625,57110,911,261,3869,12155,348,5615,880,812,13,38891,89,653,46110,28800,13,41621,9189,38831,283,19610,7010,514,56662,11,9189,308,6,52659,6502,15265,100007,1765,9189,11,10071,39015,11,9189,282,4744,668,89,15265,350,34768,7930,4046,4150,79380,409,41263,20712,5019,1744,9189,18757,1056,74466,46131,13,34447,389,92215,48908,35597,5636,78060,1880,7684,2058,3846,1343,98078,48099,5019,9765,462,16339,951,2107,668,1759,13,362,5589,409,9765,462,16339,951,2107,668,1759,2107,4893,409,85877,440,261,951,95159,1439,7010,951,37194,82,6033,951,737,2727,392,645,13,19421,44351,27389,43406,8657,285,64656,259,35657,3625,3369,2159,265,1392,13,19421,272,17771,3846,1744,17317,2267,19941,13,19421,272,17771,3846,1744,17317,2267,19941,13,34447,14707,33670,294,41901,2961,1553,39015,11,9189,9189,665,294,2182,89,11,3900,47090,45347,1370,1208,1162,9511,67763,13,19421,7643,38317,513,20272,665,26633,14240,9521,13,5034,55133,1826,1208,27389,36235,294,31769,11943,484,2439,13,19421,1208,513,95959,1826,1208,57705,978,6091,367,3469,2428,13,14465,56445,1370,9765,462,16339,1647,5634,28154,2933,32118,4919,1152,1572,1189,13,19421,5019,39043,11,4864,91507,46932,265,6316,1421,6672,7930,757,29557,294,6,677,2002,404,653,5634,28154,2933,9952,951,21744,10515,5512,2598,24520,31539,13,56744,72,27750,21744,10515,5512,11,3900,379,264,1208,1317,79623,294,6,17675,294,31769,2796,11,7930,1826,1208,76651,7930,1826,4046,74306,11,1208,62827,951,41936,11,10071,28463,1208,6070,69084,543,483,11,7930,1826,1208,76407,15890,11083,19670,288,15132,21874,5512,7010,1647,5634,28154,2933,13,14465,296,19010,853,11083,81336,15433,4167,11,503,41901,35124,818,7643,27389,36235,11,4864,2967,648,5019,64290,404,6316,281,3023,265,11,1880,503,34155,1647,33088,461,13,36684,4046,11943,484,2439,15132,514,296,19010,853,409,20662,281,3023,265,33088,461,9952,3930,27572,4931,11,7930,1826,653,46033,12339,11,6033,653,88247,2428,11,4502,9189,27389,59958,23577,13,622,6,677,10462,729,951,83400,47003,7930,15132,3547,3742,3869,7591,35627,11,1880,4864,94297,45347,3869,1208,10474,46932,5048,13,62408,88818,6824,68,3869,6155,467,63940,32118,4919,81235,11083,4046,11943,484,2439,13,362,326,26248,579,294,22827,88486,324,11,503,57286,556,11083,83400,47003,11,44829,4864,3625,1375,9011,1557,11,1880,503,41901,54387,265,1208,41263,20712,7930,1826,4046,74306,13,622,6,677,10462,729,951,44827,11,22299,1370,51173,326,55624,729,13109,41263,483,817,11,665,34501,409,1208,6155,1673,68,1744,503,34155,17537,5118,8047,13,2998,294,81979,4751,288,11,45602,296,6,485,2428,1208,85722,1208,5636,31914,580,5019,39929,653,7340,409,41263,20712,13,1708,1105,11,503,98279,24281,1744,76076,294,6,40997,9189,82133,42676,27584,4043,1155,409,272,34858,3930,924,846,46206,84440,3846,57992,11,2536,949,435,1339,288,6666,42676,27584,11,1841,9465,87892,11,39043,25692,20028,6502,8811,294,57286,2910,37907,13,14465,9189,312,1195,25134,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,8586,374,264,11093,36815,315,279,1495,512,198,12834,2744,11,893,706,16495,311,11741,8630,5678,505,7600,3750,13,1283,52114,4027,323,91231,988,264,6917,430,1888,4336,3177,323,8798,5304,1461,13,5659,1344,396,311,279,12956,261,11,584,527,682,304,2778,315,420,37066,13,1628,8051,1202,8830,5084,9120,278,3432,11,1070,2103,3073,3738,44247,315,3177,430,658,799,603,13,12040,369,3187,264,6710,315,13465,13,12522,499,3596,6818,311,1464,433,304,279,6453,30,2360,30,7566,30,2360,30,8489,11,358,2846,2133,311,1456,311,28008,499,13,578,25885,304,3488,374,2663,7852,1152,1572,36634,13,9636,22936,1957,11,1063,7384,1093,13465,527,13171,315,90556,62385,315,3177,13,3061,143
