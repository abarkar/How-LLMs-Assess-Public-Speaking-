Let me help you combine it with another text.\n\nTo start, I'll provide the English translation of your text:\n\n**TRANSCRIPT**\n\nOnce upon a time, in a distant kingdom, there was a sad blacksmith who seemed uncertain. This brave man, indeed, was thoroughly stuck. He couldn't produce good quality pieces - vises, carburizers, gearwheels - and all his work was rejected and ended up as scrap. It was probably due to his simulations. A necessary step that needs to be taken upfront. The metal he was working with wasn't well simulated, his colleagues told him. \"Are you stuck? Why don't you come to us who have special machines for fine experiments? By testing your metal, you can refine your model and simulations without pressure.\" But the blacksmith said to himself, \"I want to conduct my tests on industrial presses. My thesis is that I can intelligently exploit the workshop for greater independence. If I achieve the same results with my 5-meter-high presses as I do at the lab, it will show that it's possible, if not better, to bypass expensive testing.\" He installed a sensor adapted to measure efforts developed best on his presses. With three lasers on the fitted tooling, he could measure deformation. He experimented with his super-equipped presses on simple steel cylinders. The selected test, simple yet not simplistic, crushed the cylinders between two smooth plates. The blacksmith found, thanks to this experience, the parameters of the model useful for his science. Finished were the rejects and non-conforming pieces - all these simulations were finally up to standard! But in the meantime, his colleagues had finished their tests, and other parameters were found with success... But was it for the same material? The same model? That's impossible. Who is the most faithful? His lab colleagues. It's still their job. But the differences between them aren't too great. With some effort and a few years, someday everything will be settled. The blacksmith resumed his work and lived happily ever after, with many small doctorates. **FIN**\n\nNow, please provide the other text you'd like to combine with this one.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,7695,43989,6316,37291,11,7010,653,938,7911,3972,781,396,467,11,653,490,17194,369,1414,263,7930,80664,1339,3709,7770,13,24703,34300,40351,11,665,67781,11,43989,14707,8126,49530,978,13,7695,841,1370,1055,1339,6502,3869,6316,51651,60128,13,350,5612,3625,70477,1634,934,35329,57728,1339,11,2145,11,1841,2785,1157,11,2995,1466,1154,11,97958,40744,2098,355,14014,1880,296,5014,3869,1208,7591,14215,13,356,96287,15878,294,2182,1208,2267,1088,3869,15907,47590,13,39783,14240,2070,100243,7930,513,20272,665,1097,546,13,2009,36252,278,934,35329,57728,1339,14240,519,8811,76773,978,11,15907,4631,4558,70,1157,25400,97057,13,12769,2722,4160,321,6496,8126,49530,978,949,435,2852,39587,76190,3869,17317,7930,57038,951,12933,71269,689,1001,27389,85,1157,5019,951,1367,28154,2436,35018,13,2998,1296,519,8941,36252,278,11,9964,5019,13075,11,15878,3577,290,11,7970,3125,8941,83597,1880,51309,47590,13,8345,34447,514,369,1414,263,22011,3869,64160,17274,11,12769,14465,5320,2249,20028,11083,4043,2852,1765,1685,325,67965,6853,13,11583,270,4558,325,1826,1744,4864,94297,9952,11478,7684,2058,326,6,266,68249,5019,5636,294,6,485,978,3825,685,13,12095,503,6,1138,535,9952,11083,54063,409,220,20,296,75104,409,62321,8065,27584,65285,266,1744,11083,281,17724,8065,10278,78,11,45602,1647,376,2473,934,35329,1826,3284,11,37572,64972,11,409,513,45347,409,70375,951,7177,834,3825,53819,13,8345,7695,4685,64,1765,15907,54063,13,1252,2107,668,324,10737,978,5019,11083,7889,8065,64972,3625,9045,68866,5512,13,19421,9952,56321,72475,1765,326,6,412,48164,348,1056,978,11,272,17771,1208,7591,1659,934,35329,264,18757,11083,7889,13,7695,1367,14081,3904,64,15907,54063,1765,978,36847,14014,1765,409,69406,43021,485,417,35881,13649,5512,7010,326,6,54553,13,2009,1296,71132,52235,11,4382,10071,6502,15858,17194,11,4046,5192,300,1339,3625,43021,485,417,9465,26633,12235,12249,326,85460,13,2009,369,1414,263,26483,6723,11,77433,3869,20662,88411,11,3625,1719,75104,3930,83597,8791,458,3869,829,8198,13,5767,72,514,84129,1880,3625,70477,1634,2536,26965,288,11,40744,27750,47590,97958,665,5589,10253,7617,288,13,34447,9465,27138,11,15907,4631,4558,70,1157,384,77065,1913,72,43153,4043,2852,13,19421,294,81979,1719,75104,282,77065,26483,85,5512,9952,94499,13,34447,5019,514,27584,5634,28154,2933,949,27058,514,27584,83597,949,356,8458,841,513,25692,13,7930,1826,514,5636,33204,51453,949,64027,4631,4558,70,1157,3930,10278,78,13,356,17771,42676,27584,28130,30870,9363,13,34447,3625,91329,7183,9465,84440,841,15132,6502,409,21965,13,62293,45889,9045,1880,45889,65838,11,653,9880,3355,61799,514,27138,39723,16968,35737,9517,6200,978,13,2009,369,1414,263,31736,275,39587,4538,42775,1880,3900,45165,10453,77818,2249,1880,84871,409,86696,10896,1900,13,5767,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,32,8753,1495,0,6914,757,1520,499,16343,433,449,2500,1495,627,198,1271,1212,11,358,3358,3493,279,6498,14807,315,701,1495,1473,9,9,49873,25823,334,198,198,12805,5304,264,892,11,304,264,29827,26135,11,1070,574,264,12703,3776,34117,889,9508,36218,13,1115,34300,893,11,13118,11,574,27461,16075,13,1283,7846,956,8356,1695,4367,9863,482,2145,288,11,1841,11490,12509,11,14787,86,73610,482,323,682,813,990,574,18010,323,9670,709,439,21512,13,1102,574,4762,4245,311,813,47590,13,362,5995,3094,430,3966,311,387,4529,65451,13,578,9501,568,574,3318,449,5828,956,1664,46836,11,813,18105,3309,1461,13,330,11787,499,16075,30,8595,1541,956,499,2586,311,603,889,617,3361,12933,369,7060,21896,30,3296,7649,701,9501,11,499,649,46464,701,1646,323,47590,2085,7410,1210,2030,279,3776,34117,1071,311,5678,11,330,40,1390,311,6929,856,7177,389,13076,54063,13,3092,17850,374,430,358,649,60538,4501,33294,279,26129,369,7191,24589,13,1442,358,11322,279,1890,3135,449,856,220,20,73601,28661,54063,439,358,656,520,279,10278,11,433,690,1501,430,433,596,3284,11,422,539,2731,11,311,31818,11646,7649,1210,1283,10487,264,12271,30464,311,6767,9045,8040,1888,389,813,54063,13,3161,2380,72475,389,279,29441,5507,287,11,568,1436,6767,91621,13,1283,98504,449,813,2307,88202,54063,389,4382,9699,75421,13,578,4183,1296,11,4382,3686,539,78630,11,33745,279,75421,1990,1403,11113,25485,13,578,3776,34117,1766,11,9523,311,420,3217,11,279,5137,315,279,1646,5505,369,813,8198,13,53726,1051,279,60515,323,2536,15204,55857,9863,482,682,1521,47590,1051,5616,709,311,5410,0,2030,304,279,33953,11,813,18105,1047,8220,872,7177,11,323,1023,5137,1051,1766,449,2450,1131,2030,574,433,369,279,1890,3769,30,578,1890,1646,30,3011,596,12266,13,10699,374,279,1455,37513,30,5414,10278,18105,13,1102,596,2103,872,2683,13,2030,279,12062,1990,1124,7784,956,2288,2294,13,3161,1063,5149,323,264,2478,1667,11,54108,4395,690,387,23183,13,578,3776,34117,58505,813,990,323,12439,37875,3596,1306,11,449,1690,2678,10896,988,13,3146,17167,334,198,198,7184,11,4587,3493,279,1023,1495,499,4265,1093,311,16343,449,420,832,13,128009],"total_duration":14410208192,"load_duration":221526,"prompt_eval_count":563,"prompt_eval_durat
