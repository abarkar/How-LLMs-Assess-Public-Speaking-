They get lost in their own existence. But what about us? How do we find ourselves in our existence? It's so natural that we don't really think about it. We navigate through fragments of our existence without asking too many questions, quietly. For example, before coming here, each of us was doing something else. Which has nothing to do with what's happening here. And when we leave here, we'll all go on to pursue something else in our lives. Just like our body moves in a physical space composed of places, buildings, and rooms, where it can come and go, our consciousness moves in a mental space composed of thought subjects, goals, activities, and stories, where it goes and returns, forming different continuities that intersect and continue over time. These continuities in which our spirit goes and returns, these continuities we put on hold and pick up again later, sometimes much later, when we run into an old friend we haven't seen in years, for instance... That's what a game works with. I'm trying to understand how we live lives whose content is so fragmented and intertwined over time. How do we live multiple small lives mixed together in one life, somehow? I study all the perception mechanisms, memory mechanisms involved in managing these continuities, these little lives. To do this, I recreate on a reduced scale the fragmentation of our life through video games that I design. My participants play different games, each game representing a continuity. Then, I manipulate parameters to differentiate the games and measure the participants' ability to adapt to changes, remember what happened, project themselves into the future, and perceive time. All this to understand how we can better take advantage of our brain's mechanisms, whether it's to better manage the growing complexity of our lives, boost our creativity, or better understand certain mental problems. We can very well live and accomplish many things without really understanding how we work. It's not necessary. And honestly, it's pretty crazy when you think about it, isn't it? On the other hand, if we had to understand how we work to start living, we would never have started and wouldn't be here. Because believe me, we have to crack our heads to figure out what's going on in our head. That said, even if we can do everything without understanding how we do it, but imagine what we could do if we understood better what's happening up there.\"","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,41621,3665,89,11,3625,48577,7930,14848,1208,8811,329,648,294,6,2149,42360,11,84568,308,6,1138,81541,5636,3869,14707,274,6,15226,261,13,4072,645,513,41518,306,7010,28130,83187,14209,13,34447,17317,11,4068,1826,54312,934,54386,20272,5019,513,38831,15170,7010,29449,14209,11,665,20272,949,356,17771,19227,1001,7138,75,934,54386,841,829,275,6502,60019,13,1952,34512,361,7010,3625,35603,409,29449,14209,11,15878,21965,513,1153,261,409,4860,11,8065,1652,2727,13,4366,51173,11,39015,11,70374,33670,409,96586,49733,11,95917,359,294,6,40997,17317,66517,1339,47838,14896,13,24703,7930,308,26248,55455,3869,46131,9952,3846,7930,513,39904,49733,13,19421,42676,389,961,9008,294,6,3457,11,389,6348,64,26725,67807,84,84595,79071,14896,294,49455,265,7010,29449,17536,13,1611,1208,27584,85722,1744,29449,34922,513,7591,2050,7010,653,1560,1330,64441,11,40321,978,409,10457,2249,11,409,293,64272,12843,11,409,4371,645,11,7010,3625,447,37907,3900,25692,48908,1880,19443,404,11,29449,42563,513,7591,2050,7010,653,1560,1330,10723,11,40321,978,409,924,75004,409,23423,8047,11,409,719,82,11,294,6,9035,35933,11,294,6,21843,78,3946,11,7010,3625,447,37907,27549,11412,1880,5891,1188,11,409,80444,3869,4846,96642,2018,3159,5512,7930,513,14425,285,306,1880,7930,513,67807,84,81541,11,3869,30517,514,27138,13,62463,2018,3159,5512,7010,3625,447,37907,29449,1560,40807,11412,1880,5891,1188,11,27750,2018,3159,5512,1744,326,54386,2322,665,18579,1880,1744,326,54386,312,59976,5636,62197,11,1370,86633,48488,5636,62197,11,42676,389,38831,83384,653,52827,934,54386,308,26248,6502,33614,41199,951,65838,11,1370,51173,11,272,17771,3846,1765,75249,653,51655,42775,273,13,622,6,26577,648,409,60946,265,4068,389,20272,5019,18434,265,951,348,552,15890,514,76354,1826,4502,12569,978,1880,1218,1864,5615,69328,7010,514,27138,13,12535,389,20272,5019,18434,265,51854,98385,348,552,32118,5317,14014,7010,6316,27584,17536,11,665,79071,80444,949,622,57286,664,648,26725,3625,32118,4919,2191,288,409,21063,11,409,32118,97495,11,5906,665,51655,7010,1208,59471,409,27750,2018,3159,5512,11,409,27750,98385,348,552,13,27058,3846,20028,11,4864,14843,285,3869,6316,4046,331,6853,9517,1072,635,1208,88452,409,29449,17536,3869,30517,951,70175,57146,1744,4864,390,68453,13,36684,13324,28068,306,3869,51854,70175,85114,11,46777,51655,91678,519,6316,2018,3159,978,13,65381,31632,409,39015,11,4864,14951,1130,951,1719,75104,5019,44178,63934,1291,3625,70175,1880,4864,84921,1208,23878,13109,951,13324,409,274,6,20311,10253,2609,3808,409,51655,11,409,513,98395,409,3846,7930,274,17771,81621,11,409,513,22040,1430,7010,514,18111,324,11,1880,28130,21063,3930,27138,13,80905,39043,5019,60946,265,4068,64972,45712,261,79988,951,32118,4919,2191,288,409,29449,272,5976,2933,11,1744,3846,45441,5019,64972,342,52424,1208,6485,13109,14425,1056,5048,409,12155,348,552,11,5019,35881,455,1565,29449,34280,20053,13109,11,6033,5019,64972,60946,265,76076,52088,66474,11540,12249,13,1952,25692,25945,14707,18434,265,1880,9465,59976,265,84871,409,79165,15878,60019,60946,265,4068,389,34501,818,13,24703,308,17771,6502,100243,13,19421,9465,17317,11,272,17771,42676,27584,79380,57625,42676,389,379,9517,1517,978,331,275,11,2536,949,423,22827,47838,81337,11,4502,389,50590,63669,409,60946,265,4068,389,34501,818,5019,1081,20099,3869,18434,265,11,389,308,6,4202,1339,56316,59062,978,1880,389,841,87264,6502,39015,13,4366,346,1744,272,3433,10333,1474,6870,11,389,42182,513,272,34858,1208,83067,5019,60946,265,3846,7930,513,39904,7010,29449,83067,13,356,8458,22011,11,4502,389,17782,3869,20028,16968,3846,934,54386,17782,3869,20028,15878,60946,265,4068,389,20272,11,10071,6669,10670,3846,934,54386,92215,20028,4502,389,60946,64972,16968,3846,7930,513,39904,39015,2902,2784,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,8586,374,279,6498,14807,315,279,36815,1473,22336,1440,11,1274,449,44531,596,8624,649,956,11744,5694,14926,13,2435,636,5675,304,872,1866,14209,13,2030,1148,922,603,30,2650,656,584,1505,13520,304,1057,14209,30,1102,596,779,5933,430,584,1541,956,2216,1781,922,433,13,1226,21546,1555,35603,315,1057,14209,2085,10371,2288,1690,4860,11,30666,13,1789,3187,11,1603,5108,1618,11,1855,315,603,574,3815,2555,775,13,16299,706,4400,311,656,449,1148,596,12765,1618,13,1628,994,584,5387,1618,11,584,3358,682,733,389,311,23564,2555,775,304,1057,6439,13,4702,1093,1057,2547,11031,304,264,7106,3634,24306,315,7634,11,14016,11,323,12295,11,1405,433,649,2586,323,733,11,1057,25917,11031,304,264,10723,3634,24306,315,3463,15223,11,9021,11,7640,11,323,7493,11,1405,433,5900,323,4780,11,30164,2204,16513,1385,430,32896,323,3136,927,892,13,4314,16513,1385,304,902,1057,9090,5900,323,4780,11,1521,16513,1385,584,2231,389,3412,323,3820,709,1578,3010,11,7170,1790,3010,11,994,584,1629,1139,459,2362,4333,584,9167,956,3970,304,1667,11,369,2937,1131,3011,596,1148,264,1847,4375,449,13,358,2846,4560,311,3619,1268,584,3974,6439,6832,2262,374,779,87195,323,99892,927,892,13,2650,656,584,3974,53
