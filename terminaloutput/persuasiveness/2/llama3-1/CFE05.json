Here it is:\n\n**TRANSCRIPT**\n\nAccording to you, what is the most vital need for all living beings that we often take for granted? Eating? Sleeping? Not at all. It's breathing. But not just any air. Pure and non-polluted air. Every year, air pollution is responsible for the death of 7 million people worldwide. That's more than the cumulative deaths from tuberculosis, diabetes, and road accidents. And according to the World Health Organization, more than 9 out of 10 people breathe in ambient air that is too polluted. So, you agree with me that knowing the sources of atmospheric pollutants is very important. Because it's the first step that will allow us to develop strategies for reducing these pollutant emissions. That's exactly the objective of my thesis.\n\nAnd to better understand... I'll give you a simple example. Suppose someone asks me to group all people born in the same geographic location into this room. How would I do it? It's easy. All I need to do is ask the question, right? So, let's do it. Those who were born in Auvergne, please raise your hands. Thank you. And those who are not from Auvergne? Thank you. You can put your hands down now.\n\nNow, listen carefully. Those who are born in Auvergne have the same origin. Even if you're not from the same family, it's the same principle with my pollutants. I determine their emission sources, or their origins, by making them talk to me in a specific way using analysis tools. We who are not born in Auvergne didn't take the same route to get here, nor did we adopt the same means of transportation. In short, we have different stories. That's exactly what I want to understand with my pollutants by trying to figure out what they become when they move away from their emission sources. Just like some of us who have traveled hundreds or even thousands of kilometers to get to Auvergne, pollutants can also travel hundreds of kilometers and pollute other areas. They can also father new pollutant babies through chemical reactions in the atmosphere. These baby pollutants, called secondary pollutants, are just as or even more harmful than their parents in contributing to acid rain, climate change, and even building and crop degradation. You see that beyond their negative effects on humans and animals, air pollution is also detrimental to the environment and climate.\n\nAnd yet, we can't deprive ourselves of breathing, right? However, we can already start acquiring good habits. So, before you leave tonight, I'd like each of you to ask yourself this very simple question. I invite you to go watch next week's video. Thank you. The first question is very important: What do I do to improve the quality of the air that I breathe?","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,24082,263,9189,11,26077,1826,514,63669,514,5636,16595,5019,43905,23761,18434,5048,1744,326,54386,35456,25945,71151,5019,1645,9383,949,386,4091,949,98632,404,949,57895,40906,6502,13,356,17771,514,20272,409,33515,261,13,34447,6502,308,6,94896,26077,3805,13,1611,326,6,1334,4087,1880,2536,1499,72,13,921,20234,76132,11,1208,25793,409,326,6,1334,1826,77932,409,1208,10237,409,220,22,11990,409,48577,7010,514,38900,13,356,17771,5636,1744,3625,35881,12416,12454,360,5512,294,1220,28463,39015,13,362,1208,15286,69293,974,11,8065,1891,370,66522,1880,10253,33788,409,1208,6149,13,19421,65735,326,6,24105,8082,62940,20487,409,1208,77323,11,5636,409,220,24,48577,1765,220,605,9216,556,406,409,326,6,1334,9049,5485,21965,1499,72,13,4418,66,9189,62299,294,69537,541,9952,41091,1744,14707,74282,66014,3625,8336,951,7230,84,1821,14036,764,28154,14295,1826,25945,3062,13,3341,272,17771,1208,55133,14240,2070,7930,29557,2221,294,6,19010,4422,261,951,44397,19395,552,409,9517,23985,951,4046,5287,409,27750,7230,84,1821,13,356,17771,39043,1120,1133,326,6,1735,333,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,19421,5019,64972,514,60946,265,1131,14465,91507,9189,71751,653,51173,25945,4382,13,6433,981,2439,1744,326,54386,757,62163,409,1239,583,716,40744,3625,48577,308,14014,7010,653,27584,39381,74672,3257,2428,7010,20662,71632,13,27058,3846,20028,11,272,17771,4382,13,7695,8657,275,409,9189,1153,261,1208,3488,11,308,17771,54312,6502,949,1708,1105,682,2439,12303,13,24703,2249,7930,15132,308,5512,665,33150,424,68255,11,4864,9189,281,7379,294,31769,72905,3625,69236,13,25145,72,13,19421,66056,7930,15132,308,5512,264,4618,1759,949,25145,72,13,41621,45366,98004,805,3625,69236,13,43987,26178,11,91329,2182,89,52309,91640,13,24703,2249,7930,15132,308,5512,665,33150,424,68255,14848,1208,27584,2780,483,13,386,23034,4502,9189,308,6,90276,6502,409,1208,27584,67628,11,272,17771,514,27584,82660,3527,9952,11083,7230,84,1821,13,14465,7591,5098,483,43153,8336,294,31769,5287,11,39587,43153,2780,1572,11,665,3625,66517,519,89504,3869,7643,85722,11,3869,326,26248,579,294,6,412,8839,294,6,44803,325,71269,333,8467,13,48109,7930,841,74533,6502,308,5512,665,33150,424,68255,11,17317,308,49152,2439,6502,20272,514,27584,63128,295,5019,96586,49733,11,13080,11142,978,3625,123299,9004,52138,729,409,7710,13,2998,25500,11,17317,57038,951,77617,3946,96642,13,356,17771,1120,1133,27750,77617,3946,1744,4864,5320,2249,60946,265,9952,11083,7230,84,1821,665,9071,519,409,47929,3846,934,85217,3567,72,89810,37953,447,85217,274,31769,385,625,306,409,43153,8336,294,31769,5287,13,80905,22299,76076,294,6,40997,17317,7930,14848,45740,414,84,951,2960,33903,11,4160,556,951,2606,4918,409,15395,316,75104,5019,96586,3869,33150,424,68255,11,3625,7230,84,1821,56311,28463,45740,414,404,951,2960,33903,409,15395,316,75104,1880,7230,8977,294,81979,842,299,1220,13,81245,56311,44767,665,31278,466,951,90551,65,5512,7230,84,1821,16578,3869,951,9517,4109,38094,8467,7010,326,6,266,8801,764,12339,13,62463,90551,65,5512,7230,84,1821,11,76190,5512,7230,84,1821,2132,17724,11,15132,16968,28463,6033,35597,5636,76597,22589,1744,43153,6699,665,6044,28674,8065,1343,98078,48099,951,121696,552,1645,3422,11,8065,9517,6583,1386,1133,11323,266,2428,1880,27584,3869,1208,7591,49241,951,293,64272,12843,1880,951,27833,13,41621,23933,10333,934,6,2933,48226,6496,409,43153,3369,1441,76597,22589,1765,326,6,87713,1880,3625,4039,12249,11,1208,25793,409,326,6,1334,1826,28463,38605,69,5642,5019,326,41901,2842,40280,1880,514,11323,266,13,19421,5019,61512,11,389,841,25692,6502,513,550,1553,409,33515,261,11,308,17771,54312,6502,949,356,13059,519,11,389,25692,46939,1081,20099,3869,19830,14081,404,3625,82134,9517,12287,288,13,4418,66,11,33670,409,31632,3846,57992,11,503,6,2706,81356,1744,95917,359,409,17317,513,17477,20662,3488,25945,4382,13,14465,9189,22114,3869,48908,46131,1208,57146,409,1208,72709,463,331,8511,13,25145,72,13,5034,55133,3488,1826,25945,36897,13,3489,17771,54312,1744,4864,66517,5019,1097,73511,15171,1208,60128,409,326,6,1334,1744,4864,9216,556,949,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5084,1093,499,1390,757,311,16343,279,1495,1139,264,36815,3645,13,5810,433,374,1473,9,9,49873,25823,334,198,198,11439,311,499,11,1148,374,279,1455,16595,1205,369,682,5496,23837,430,584,3629,1935,369,11938,30,60638,30,75247,30,2876,520,682,13,1102,596,27027,13,2030,539,1120,904,3805,13,30688,323,2536,2320,980,2844,3805,13,7357,1060,11,3805,25793,374,8647,369,279,4648,315,220,22,3610,1274,15603,13,3011,596,810,1109,279,40944,16779,505,88234,11,20335,11,323,5754,33788,13,1628,4184,311,279,4435,6401,21021,11,810,1109,220,24,704,315,220,605,1274,37397,304,35288,3805,430,374,2288,95869,13,2100,11,499,7655,449,757,430,14392,279,8336,315,45475,83661,374,1633,3062,13,9393,433,596,279,1176,3094,430,690,2187,603,311,2274,15174,369,18189,1521,71134,519,20748,13,3011,596,7041,279,16945,315,856,17850,627,198,3112,311,2731,3619,1131,358,3358,3041,499,264,4382,3187,13
