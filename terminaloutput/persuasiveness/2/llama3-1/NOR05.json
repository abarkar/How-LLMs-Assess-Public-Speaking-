It's amazing that most people here present have a microwave oven to heat their food, but never thought of using it to produce fuel for their car. And that's what my thesis is about: using a microwave cavity to produce an ecological fuel. Well, I know you're wondering how this works, what I do in my lab. Okay, imagine you're at home and you take a cold baguette, a bread baguette, and put it in the microwave. If you leave it for too long, it will be burnt and your kitchen will be filled with smoke. In my case, I don't have any smoke in my lab or kitchen. I take that smoke, condense it, and obtain a liquid fuel. So, don't worry, I won't let France go up in flames. I have to take another material that's more ecological, one that represents 80% of renewable energy in Europe. This material is called biomass. Biomass is any organic matter from plant or animal origin that can be transformed into energy. For example, waste, agricultural surplus, and also wood. And that's where it starts. That's where the first question of my thesis begins: How can I use this biomass to produce an ecological fuel? Well, for that, I use a process called pyrolysis. Pyrolysis is the thermal degradation of a material in an atmosphere without oxygen to obtain charcoal, non-condensable gases, and also a liquid, combustible oil. And now there's a second question: How can we use this biomass to produce an ecological fuel? How am I going to heat up the biomass with microwaves to produce the fuel? Well, you have to know that in a microwave cavity, there are electromagnetic sensors traveling. When they come into contact with the biomass, it starts moving. But since these particles cannot move as we want, it causes friction inside the biomass, like all revolutions. But this friction takes place at charcoal production. And that's where the biomass develops. That's one of the first things we did. It's a small reduction in heat and thus the thermal degradation that produces fuel. And that's where the difficulty lies in my thesis. Because I have to find ways to improve the absorption and contact of these electromagnetic sensors, to improve heating up the biomass and thus its degradation, and thus fuel production. Well, I'm sure that in the future, my thesis will help you produce your own ecological fuel at home with your microwave oven. Thank you very much.\n\nPlease note that this is a translation from French, so some nuances may be lost in
