He discovers fire and venerates a star that provides light and warmth. From flint to switch, we are all searching for this glow. And although its understanding seems banal today, there still exist certain light phenomena that elude us. Take, for example, a piece of sugar. Have you ever tried to break it in the dark? No? Yes? No? Well, I'll try to convince you. The phenomenon at issue is called mechanoluminescence. Under mechanical stress, some materials like sugar are capable of emitting flashes of light. Flashes that can be red, green, or even blue. And we call these materials phosphores. I'm trying to identify the mechanisms behind the emission of light and understand how this phenomenon can be repeated infinitely. And as a bonus, I think about how to integrate them into our clothes. Imagine it. You're in the dark, you don't have your phone on you, but there, you rub your T-shirt that emits enough light for you to see. But we could go even further and exploit this phenomenon to make sensors. To create sensors capable of detecting cracks in bridges or buildings. And thus prevent collapses from happening too late. And that's what we're doing. But before getting there, you know it, we have to stop by the lab. My research is done in two stages. The first stage is preparing samples. And the second stage is optical characterization. I start by making my mechanoluminescent material. And for that, I'll follow a recipe that allows me to obtain a material with special properties. Among these properties are the emission wavelength, which is the color emitted, grain size, but also crystal structure, which is the way my atoms are organized in my material. I mix my ingredients, pour my preparation, grind it into a powder, and I have my phosphore. My samples are the mixture of this phosphore powder with PDMS, which is a polymer or plastic, if you prefer. I get sheets that are easy to deform, and I can move on to the next stage. This one consists in mechanically constraining my samples. Using a motor, I stretch my sheets, then release them, and record the light emitted. I obtain information, such as intensity of light, in function of the stress I applied. In other words, it shows me the most effective way to get the maximum amount of light. So, I imagine that some of you will still try to break sugar at home tonight, huh? Just be careful, because among friends, it can create quite a few sparks. Thank you.\"","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,4241,9425,44093,11,326,6,87713,52571,3869,274,6,15824,556,409,326,6,5598,2407,13109,13,7695,59148,49606,514,82711,1880,348,10610,12339,653,12025,265,7930,25400,14814,22711,41263,20712,1880,523,61047,13,16062,274,458,87,3869,326,55624,10802,12844,11,17317,74533,26725,3869,1208,38317,409,20662,326,79623,13,19421,14707,1744,829,13550,978,71,2711,97487,75804,88253,9120,1604,11,3900,29253,35597,76076,1343,98078,4558,4978,409,41263,20712,7930,17317,4046,331,680,306,13,5075,55506,1370,51173,653,4411,346,2933,409,924,846,13,362,19610,45325,46939,9071,978,409,514,272,34858,7010,514,56662,949,11842,949,507,2005,949,11842,949,13789,13,6178,72,11,4864,91507,4043,1155,409,9189,5804,467,846,13,2009,1343,98078,48099,15890,3900,1826,3488,274,53149,6853,1208,32118,4919,1152,1572,36634,13,89578,1957,32118,4919,2428,11,76076,86374,4298,2249,22299,514,924,846,15132,2107,4893,294,31769,4150,10367,951,62385,409,41263,20712,13,3959,62385,7930,56311,23761,29465,4282,11,60514,6033,27584,12704,355,13,19421,389,917,6853,27750,86374,4298,2249,2922,6496,951,33088,4692,13,6178,72,11,503,6,26577,648,294,6,16288,3625,32118,4919,2191,288,7930,15132,3869,326,6,4775,483,409,326,31769,2796,409,41263,20712,1880,409,60946,265,4068,3846,1343,98078,48099,25692,23761,9517,79,39883,3869,326,52152,5589,72,13,19421,665,12306,11,4864,9517,1517,978,331,285,3869,1208,85722,409,3625,57110,911,261,3869,12155,348,5615,880,812,13,38891,89,653,46110,28800,13,41621,9189,38831,283,19610,7010,514,56662,11,9189,308,6,52659,6502,15265,100007,1765,9189,11,10071,39015,11,9189,282,4744,668,89,15265,350,34768,7930,4046,4150,79380,409,41263,20712,5019,1744,9189,18757,1056,74466,46131,13,34447,389,92215,48908,35597,5636,78060,1880,7684,2058,3846,1343,98078,48099,5019,9765,462,16339,951,2107,668,1759,13,362,5589,409,9765,462,16339,951,2107,668,1759,2107,4893,409,85877,440,261,951,95159,1439,7010,951,37194,82,6033,951,737,2727,392,645,13,19421,44351,27389,43406,8657,285,64656,259,35657,3625,3369,2159,265,1392,13,19421,272,17771,3846,1744,17317,2267,19941,13,19421,272,17771,3846,1744,17317,2267,19941,13,34447,14707,33670,294,41901,2961,1553,39015,11,9189,9189,665,294,2182,89,11,3900,47090,45347,1370,1208,1162,9511,67763,13,19421,7643,38317,513,20272,665,26633,14240,9521,13,5034,55133,1826,1208,27389,36235,294,31769,11943,484,2439,13,19421,1208,513,95959,1826,1208,57705,978,6091,367,3469,2428,13,14465,56445,1370,9765,462,16339,1647,5634,28154,2933,32118,4919,1152,1572,1189,13,19421,5019,39043,11,4864,91507,46932,265,6316,1421,6672,7930,757,29557,294,6,677,2002,404,653,5634,28154,2933,9952,951,21744,10515,5512,2598,24520,31539,13,56744,72,27750,21744,10515,5512,11,3900,379,264,1208,1317,79623,294,6,17675,294,31769,2796,11,7930,1826,1208,76651,7930,1826,4046,74306,11,1208,62827,951,41936,11,10071,28463,1208,6070,69084,543,483,11,7930,1826,1208,76407,15890,11083,19670,288,15132,21874,5512,7010,1647,5634,28154,2933,13,14465,296,19010,853,11083,81336,15433,4167,11,503,41901,35124,818,7643,27389,36235,11,4864,2967,648,5019,64290,404,6316,281,3023,265,11,1880,503,34155,1647,33088,461,13,36684,4046,11943,484,2439,15132,514,296,19010,853,409,20662,281,3023,265,33088,461,9952,3930,27572,4931,11,7930,1826,653,46033,12339,11,6033,653,88247,2428,11,4502,9189,27389,59958,23577,13,622,6,677,10462,729,951,83400,47003,7930,15132,3547,3742,3869,7591,35627,11,1880,4864,94297,45347,3869,1208,10474,46932,5048,13,62408,88818,6824,68,3869,6155,467,63940,32118,4919,81235,11083,4046,11943,484,2439,13,362,326,26248,579,294,22827,88486,324,11,503,57286,556,11083,83400,47003,11,44829,4864,3625,1375,9011,1557,11,1880,503,41901,54387,265,1208,41263,20712,7930,1826,4046,74306,13,622,6,677,10462,729,951,44827,11,22299,1370,51173,326,55624,729,13109,41263,483,817,11,665,34501,409,1208,6155,1673,68,1744,503,34155,17537,5118,8047,13,2998,294,81979,4751,288,11,45602,296,6,485,2428,1208,85722,1208,5636,31914,580,5019,39929,653,7340,409,41263,20712,13,1708,1105,11,503,98279,24281,1744,76076,294,6,40997,9189,82133,42676,27584,4043,1155,409,272,34858,3930,924,846,46206,84440,3846,57992,11,2536,949,435,1339,288,6666,42676,27584,11,1841,9465,87892,11,39043,25692,20028,6502,8811,294,57286,2910,37907,13,14465,9189,312,1195,25134,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,8586,374,279,36815,1473,1,3915,2744,11,893,26737,311,8819,5678,505,27394,13,1283,52114,4027,323,91231,988,264,6917,430,5825,3177,323,41463,13,5659,1344,396,311,3480,11,584,527,682,15389,369,420,37066,13,1628,8051,1202,8830,5084,9120,278,3432,11,1070,2103,3073,3738,3177,44247,430,658,799,603,13,12040,11,369,3187,11,264,6710,315,13465,13,12522,499,3596,6818,311,1464,433,304,279,6453,30,2360,30,7566,30,2360,30,8489,11,358,3358,1456,311,28008,499,13,578,25885,520,4360,374,2663,7852,1152,1572,36634,13,9636,22936,8631,11,1063,7384,1093,13465,527,13171,315,90556,62385,315,3177,13,3061,14380,430,649,387,2579,11,6307,11,477,1524,6437,13,1628,584,1650,1521
