The speaker shares their thesis research, which combines insights from physiology, agronomy, history, and environmental science.\n\nThe main points of the presentation are:\n\n1. Human urine is an excellent fertilizer that can provide essential nutrients to plants.\n2. In the past, urine was valued as a resource for fertilizing crops, but this practice was largely abandoned with the advent of synthetic fertilizers.\n3. Today, most urine is treated as waste and released into waterways, contributing to pollution and ecological damage.\n4. The speaker argues that recycling human urine could help close the nutrient loop and reduce the environmental impact of agriculture.\n5. They present various techniques for treating and utilizing human urine, including toilet systems that separate urine from feces, and processes for converting urine into a nutrient-rich fertilizer.\n\nThe speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of social, economic, and cultural conditions in enabling the transition to a circular economy based on human urine management. They hope to raise awareness about this issue and encourage further research and action.\n\nSome key statistics mentioned in the presentation include:\n\n* 25 million baguettes of bread could be produced daily if Parisian inhabitants' urine was used to fertilize crops.\n* Only 5% of azote is currently recycled in Paris, compared to around 50% a century ago.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,2052,261,20028,24547,72,1765,1208,22408,45597,1395,13,29179,321,6496,3846,1744,7631,1339,7643,6800,1474,12339,3869,15907,86696,21430,69,1821,13,362,326,31769,5481,593,11,4864,308,6,4202,2852,56316,23423,978,1744,503,65948,2852,20028,409,1208,38317,1765,514,24547,72,13,19421,76776,11,4864,308,6,4202,2852,56316,43306,978,1744,1370,20662,95234,11,7643,6800,1474,12339,5899,1339,25692,85815,6316,951,1206,5512,409,1208,9320,91329,1640,2428,13,46706,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,14425,1082,3625,100246,409,96642,49255,7330,333,8467,5019,8678,805,1208,59471,951,3521,81,10515,919,2854,33903,13,80905,294,6,370,541,11,1208,4571,72,38469,3930,34922,2854,467,20605,265,1744,272,17771,1370,3625,4433,1572,1744,514,34922,51913,582,361,1208,3682,13109,951,10184,6417,812,11,326,6,1394,1295,951,1760,978,1572,11,3625,274,2053,1332,76743,2249,22299,514,33088,461,6033,514,62275,13,445,6,351,2298,316,648,11,27549,11,17317,20605,265,1744,3625,6136,288,513,46798,81,79738,1120,1133,409,27750,10184,6417,812,1880,1744,326,6,324,483,1826,653,9250,51155,2852,13,2998,5589,11,3625,7135,80463,20605,8135,934,81991,12366,11,8065,1630,5511,68,97739,9326,11,653,951,1665,22589,21901,2908,12249,409,1208,59471,951,3521,81,10515,919,2854,33903,43989,409,14448,12329,3625,4433,1572,5019,30870,566,261,3846,11008,951,10184,6417,812,13,19421,44829,11,8065,30388,68,97739,9326,11,1208,281,10515,299,331,318,648,1826,69003,8047,13,1952,274,17771,5906,3869,43998,10515,12329,951,51155,2852,38094,8467,3869,6800,5790,4057,294,6,67229,7063,65,1439,26495,3742,1880,3625,4433,1572,2854,33903,15132,409,46469,304,332,3742,13,4366,1208,27306,668,3869,523,13559,294,93847,1880,514,16968,3869,326,6,19395,412,11,389,3625,264,17004,5512,3869,1208,44229,20712,13,5034,60128,409,326,93847,951,436,33920,31539,1826,409,7287,35205,22761,2428,11,45575,389,264,1913,72,1370,19477,52750,951,603,1572,294,31769,79,2060,13,34447,665,18027,519,3625,384,12249,294,6,19395,412,11,27750,603,1572,841,1370,10176,89810,6502,3869,79196,52424,326,6,833,41098,12657,354,978,13,3489,6853,4824,53410,758,12095,389,14448,285,1339,326,6,324,483,409,26725,3625,14464,1821,409,326,6,351,6200,316,53301,41958,26584,5019,36214,12329,3930,1529,978,11,389,92215,2558,556,220,914,11990,409,9145,14127,2392,409,6784,1370,9880,13,19421,5019,61512,11,75804,88253,7010,20662,945,6200,316,53301,11,514,9637,2249,409,92465,425,409,326,6,1394,1295,308,17771,1744,409,220,20,13689,45575,934,35329,43989,294,41901,2842,220,1135,4,3900,379,264,653,97739,9326,13,1952,264,68866,978,653,72601,10006,978,12267,1880,7230,28674,7010,514,43014,389,54206,409,326,6,1394,1295,11,389,259,361,951,51155,2852,294,22827,81337,1880,389,3625,7591,376,3159,409,326,49455,265,13,27058,27389,4120,3625,94527,4046,447,31059,417,3197,10515,17724,11,3900,2267,664,14687,38831,15170,6316,59471,4319,74775,951,4433,1572,13,12095,9189,47592,653,91399,11,9189,45366,46932,265,514,31025,321,409,7643,6800,1474,12339,1880,36214,12329,15265,3419,1435,3869,326,6,324,483,13,34447,7930,294,6,40997,17317,4612,535,4538,1529,978,1880,20272,4538,6784,949,46706,29449,77824,16036,285,8047,11,39723,326,54386,1179,68,3625,10184,6417,812,7010,1208,39973,11,3900,2267,664,14687,2942,12329,514,54606,409,27750,10184,6417,812,5553,3625,27833,13,19421,4068,20028,665,95234,949,4241,9425,1208,27306,668,3869,19266,36235,294,6,324,483,11,55398,6,2933,13988,15433,978,409,89714,5019,665,20028,653,51155,2852,91329,1640,2428,11,503,34155,81621,665,5891,361,653,6800,13026,409,12823,7930,3073,306,46939,13,423,5512,494,2852,11,653,951,665,3841,2249,21901,2908,12249,1826,294,6,44803,805,1880,409,58673,15610,1765,3625,4787,65207,11,82653,8467,1880,7829,75,645,7930,29557,376,546,2486,467,409,30870,566,261,3846,11008,409,326,6,1394,1295,13,2998,57485,519,7643,270,4558,325,665,220,18,4520,11,503,6,25632,12339,4799,12329,6316,55133,3044,11,1208,85424,409,42563,1744,20662,9320,91329,1640,2428,513,28068,68,28463,7010,12155,27306,2392,13,25145,72,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5992,1093,499,617,264,36815,315,264,15864,389,279,8712,315,3823,40335,6373,323,1202,4754,311,17210,311,264,28029,8752,13,578,19114,13551,872,17850,3495,11,902,33511,26793,505,78152,11,40574,17404,11,3925,11,323,12434,8198,627,198,791,1925,3585,315,279,15864,527,512,198,16,13,11344,40335,374,459,9250,65391,430,649,3493,7718,37493,311,11012,13,198,17,13,763,279,3347,11,40335,574,33647,439,264,5211,369,36214,4954,31665,11,719,420,6725,574,14090,23838,449,279,11599,315,28367,36214,12509,13,198,18,13,11450,11,1455,40335,374,12020,439,12571,323,6004,1139,3090,2336,11,29820,311,25793,323,50953,5674,13,198,19,13,578,19114,29633,430,34978,3823,40335,1436,1520,3345,279,50123,6471,323,8108,279,12434,5536,315,30029,13,198,20,13,2435,3118,5370,12823,369,27723,323,35988,3823,40335,11,2737,27306,6067,430,8821,40335,505,55061,288,11,323,11618,369,34537,40335,1139,264,50123,41947,65391,627,198,791,19114,45537,555,82003,279,12939,31
