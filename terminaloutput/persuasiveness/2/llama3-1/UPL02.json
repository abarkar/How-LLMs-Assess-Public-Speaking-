It's a conversation between an adult (likely the author) and her niece Jeanne, who asks profound questions about existence and philosophy at the age of 5.\n\nThe author reflects on how she didn't have an answer to Jeanne's question about what happened before birth, and how this encounter led her to discover the practice of philosophy with children. She discusses how this approach considers children as thinking subjects, rather than just small beings to be protected.\n\nThe conversation then turns to the topic of education and human rights, specifically the United Nations' global education program on human rights since 2004. The author wonders if philosophical inquiry with children could be a means to help them better understand their rights.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, she has trained herself to facilitate philosophy workshops with children, aiming to create a pedagogical protocol that transforms certain articles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child into philosophy ateliers for kids. Her ultimate goal is to measure the effectiveness of this approach.\n\nHowever, she also acknowledges the criticism of Western-centricity in the construction of human rights and wonders how education on these rights can respond to these challenges while ensuring cultural pluralism. She hypothesizes that philosophical inquiry with children, which is a more horizontal pedagogy that puts children at the center of their reflections on rights, might be a way to ensure intercultural dialogue and build a possible universal.\n\nThroughout the conversation, the author references Jeanne's question as a catalyst for her own journey in exploring philosophy with children. The transcript concludes by mentioning another child, Antoine, who is about to turn 5 years old, hinting at the potential for future philosophical explorations with him.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,88245,11,503,31769,2629,285,39723,33670,409,4415,66014,949,64105,64,11,272,17771,1208,3488,1744,7643,13080,4558,346,20263,818,296,26248,1153,8047,3869,220,20,8261,13,1708,1105,3154,519,9189,13510,1744,4864,841,11427,2852,6502,21965,75249,75871,265,13,29124,66,2182,20263,818,11,9964,72567,300,39043,42676,9964,1446,300,5636,25626,11,294,69537,541,949,74656,97717,11,27549,43989,7591,3209,361,409,7643,90509,13,14465,1208,60946,82,13,11842,10071,272,17771,83195,11,272,17771,57625,39043,13,350,788,27750,60404,7930,17317,1153,306,951,4860,3073,306,13327,645,11,1880,17317,7930,74533,39015,3869,293,19395,1155,11,4864,36731,78705,265,1744,39043,9189,1826,46939,69003,978,13,2998,16968,4865,11,41091,39043,296,26248,10805,27843,8047,13,19421,272,17771,22299,39043,1744,503,34155,59148,1653,1208,95234,409,1208,13868,648,9952,3625,60404,13,452,8047,32592,326,6,8039,580,3930,10891,437,81509,4242,26235,445,2877,18022,7010,3625,65838,220,2031,13,39783,95234,7930,274,17771,68866,8047,409,961,412,7010,514,38900,13,19421,4864,757,36731,22011,11,55475,9952,3625,60404,11,272,17771,3625,77554,52424,2536,6502,71686,22299,951,86696,20183,45632,3869,1760,978,1414,11,10071,22299,409,45165,1018,4893,924,75004,7930,56311,23423,261,1370,84440,1474,5615,9004,13,2582,11,389,38831,83384,20662,43656,7010,1208,26958,2655,38135,951,97222,409,326,41901,61827,409,220,3753,24,11,7930,77554,12339,326,41901,61827,22299,653,45165,23349,70927,409,64079,13,19421,326,6,12210,13109,11,19189,65699,62891,11,841,17317,282,2473,6502,13510,514,32150,556,13,1708,1105,11,16968,39043,11,41091,39043,296,55624,978,22550,66021,1744,503,57286,664,648,514,64079,3869,326,31769,34985,11,1880,5636,51625,285,42625,326,31769,34985,10253,97222,2854,1771,13,1708,1105,11,3625,19687,1252,552,14848,5906,665,2035,41199,220,1049,19,11,653,18629,62940,532,294,31769,34985,10253,97222,409,326,6,87713,11,15890,1208,55133,10474,60172,1765,326,6,1137,625,1133,36413,556,1880,2132,12267,13,34447,45575,11,4068,48021,665,99225,61480,653,19227,18629,949,7695,47090,100243,479,9517,1517,978,331,404,10253,13531,35933,281,15433,55180,8467,13,9589,54312,1744,9189,3567,39395,39723,4864,5320,2249,665,96586,949,9589,54312,1744,1208,95234,409,1208,13868,648,9952,3625,60404,841,92215,6502,23761,653,23464,1291,5019,6316,94721,86740,409,43153,97222,949,1708,1105,11,4864,841,63762,6502,13,1708,1105,11,5019,38211,20662,45455,4558,325,11,4864,91507,1765,514,25911,13,1219,2727,514,46110,1732,68155,11,39015,11,4864,757,36731,1376,8047,3869,459,3212,951,520,301,4918,409,13868,648,9952,3625,60404,11,5019,20028,665,80444,1744,3625,60404,841,834,306,6502,3846,934,85217,23423,306,11,10071,934,85217,23423,306,3846,934,85217,834,306,11,3625,1097,804,3869,6316,3738,68,74772,768,13868,2428,13,3206,1665,333,11,272,17771,409,75831,653,1760,511,1286,281,15433,55180,2428,7930,43678,1339,76076,9908,409,1208,26958,2655,38135,951,97222,409,326,41901,61827,665,409,45165,1018,4893,520,301,4918,409,13868,648,11,5019,76826,11083,7889,6033,2536,1208,18713,258,768,294,22827,19227,1760,511,1286,13,34447,3900,379,264,653,10071,13,3489,17771,54312,1744,39043,1879,57609,11,6316,4046,34985,11159,6853,10253,97222,409,326,6,87713,949,14465,841,36731,6502,15878,47929,934,35329,29253,6316,65058,43665,3930,57705,12339,3056,1748,12812,21911,43711,409,1208,8246,27584,409,27750,97222,13,19421,20662,43665,841,296,48099,6502,1744,951,38682,1769,42284,83391,13,1708,1105,11,4068,326,31769,34985,10253,97222,2854,1771,25692,12,6853,75871,265,3869,27750,665,3841,2249,11,40192,404,514,39598,44618,7829,75,949,14465,66517,326,39982,1100,8942,4558,325,1744,1370,1208,95234,409,1208,13868,648,9952,3625,60404,11,7930,1826,6316,281,15433,55180,648,5636,4917,6317,1604,11,7930,2322,326,41901,61827,8065,272,89412,409,15907,9517,12287,919,1765,3625,97222,11,45575,389,25692,40192,404,326,6,6802,1728,409,1208,13868,648,9952,3625,60404,11,389,25692,40192,404,326,6,2295,66,44547,13109,8065,19910,409,1208,9517,12287,290,11,16968,665,9071,519,409,9517,1517,978,331,404,3869,653,11159,301,3284,1880,19477,3159,13,1708,1105,20263,818,11,4864,36731,46838,337,8047,11,4864,308,34155,6502,924,12646,2159,404,3869,9637,3488,11,10071,9964,100164,11,74699,4864,91507,68226,514,20028,5019,26725,3625,46106,60404,11,3869,1081,20099,1370,91254,11,4538,46110,1448,12339,11,7930,25400,11,264,293,1188,35657,220,20,8261,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,32,27387,36815,0,1102,596,264,10652,1990,459,6822,320,14617,279,3229,8,323,1077,80115,20263,818,11,889,17501,28254,4860,922,14209,323,19675,520,279,4325,315,220,20,627,198,791,3229,27053,389,1268,1364,3287,956,617,459,4320,311,20263,818,596,3488,922,1148,7077,1603,7342,11,323,1268,420,13123,6197,1077,311,7142,279,6725,315,19675,449,2911,13,3005,35434,1268,420,5603,32238,2911,439,7422,15223,11,4856,1109,1120,2678,23837,311,387,2682,627,198,791,10652,1243,10800,311,279,8712,315,6873,323,3823,3268,11,11951,279,3723,19687,6,3728,68
