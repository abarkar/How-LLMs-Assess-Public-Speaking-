The text appears to be in French, and it's about the brain's electrical activity and its potential applications in therapy.\n\nHere is the combined transcript:\n\n\"Did you know that your brain functions through electricity? Woke up, your brain can power a 25-watt lamp. This could be a revelation for ecologists, but for my soul as a young neuroscientist, the goal is something else. Playing with this electricity to find innovative therapies. For example, could we induce electrical activity to treat certain cerebral dysfunction? Yes, that's what they call deep brain stimulation. This stimulation consists of implanting two electrodes inside the brain that will connect to a simulator that will stimulate electrically in continuous brain. A bit like a pacemaker for the heart. This technique is proposed particularly for patients with Parkinson's disease for whom medication treatment causes side effects. Yes, or electroshock therapy. It's worthy of a science fiction film, but it's not devoid of risk. After a few years, this stimulation also causes side effects such as walking or balance disorders. Continuous stimulation in parkinsonian patients is not adapted to their daily life. To compare, it's like driving continuously at 130 km/h on any type of road. In normal times, you adapt your speed to the type of road and the route taken. Pardon. And the route taken. To avoid these inconveniences, we need to find a targeted electrical activity. I mean that the stimulation should be precise and active in the stimulation. Pardon. Let me start again. So, we need to find a targeted electrical activity. I recorded the electrical activity of 54 patients in a specific region, which is the subthalamic nucleus. I focused on several parameters of this activity, frequency, and power for each of these patients. And there, I faced several obstacles, especially that the frequency and power were very variable. It's very variable among these patients. But I persisted for three years, and I found that the activity was linked to symptoms and side effects. And it's a stone that will allow us to create personalized stimulation in the near future for patients who will be able to drive at an adapted speed on the road of happiness.\"","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,20680,74466,45325,1744,15265,272,5976,2933,34501,818,1370,514,293,57567,409,326,31769,47262,13109,949,29124,588,484,978,11,15265,272,5976,2933,25692,453,318,1992,6316,23598,283,273,409,220,914,72122,13,356,8458,92215,23761,6316,9517,52274,2354,5019,3625,91329,16549,288,11,10071,5019,1647,29005,2727,409,36963,18247,56447,52760,11,326,6,1735,333,1826,16968,47838,13,97148,261,9952,20662,4046,47262,13109,5019,46524,951,76680,4714,552,9721,15844,13,4366,51173,11,92215,10539,4507,556,6316,4197,13109,98151,34395,5019,18027,261,76076,22709,22188,407,77,3808,272,68862,14720,2249,949,507,2005,11,272,17771,3846,934,54386,917,6853,1208,41959,272,68862,14720,273,2848,17675,13,62408,41959,6824,68,665,326,6,6517,519,367,409,26633,98151,299,5919,3869,326,55624,57663,3930,272,5976,2933,7930,82133,96586,4667,261,653,38553,324,7930,11412,96586,12936,8646,98151,462,447,1133,665,16513,514,272,5976,2933,13,1252,28800,22299,3869,326,6,6442,277,294,22827,23744,59775,5019,514,272,89412,13,62408,15105,1826,10045,8047,81186,46206,3625,6978,93381,21719,409,1208,8811,329,648,409,62145,5019,3625,447,2053,514,89714,35030,52777,2249,2605,61652,951,3369,1441,2132,17724,13,507,2005,11,6033,3625,98151,28787,2142,13,356,17771,294,19388,294,22827,4632,409,8198,74531,11,10071,3846,308,17771,6502,7591,9110,978,409,10025,593,13,5186,12416,45889,65838,11,20662,41959,2605,61652,44767,951,3369,1441,2132,17724,22299,951,35665,409,1208,15572,68,6033,409,326,31769,447,31059,265,13,5034,41959,665,16513,46206,3625,6978,6246,29973,80463,308,17771,6502,10737,8047,3869,28130,99568,3675,13,362,64160,409,7809,57288,11,272,17771,653,28800,22299,4502,9189,436,11206,74466,665,16513,3869,220,5894,13437,71,1765,308,6,94896,26077,955,409,6149,13,2998,27138,4725,11,9189,39732,668,89,15265,348,87960,8065,955,409,6149,11,1880,3869,1208,6149,991,652,3935,8047,13,393,46396,13,19421,3869,1208,6149,991,652,3935,8047,13,27058,51913,2058,27750,46838,351,43711,1392,11,3900,2267,664,14687,46524,6316,4197,13109,98151,34395,272,1260,13,14465,296,6,30992,2428,13,7695,2267,664,14687,1744,1208,41959,45441,51625,1082,1880,934,80720,45441,4642,7010,1208,41959,13,393,46396,13,14465,91507,312,59976,265,11083,1560,652,1220,13,1708,41881,13,4418,66,11,3900,47090,46524,6316,4197,13109,98151,34395,272,1260,13,622,34155,665,49564,978,326,6,9035,13109,98151,34395,46206,220,4370,6978,7010,6316,88100,14707,51625,1082,11,7930,1826,514,912,88,2933,32592,7716,17243,2428,13,14465,757,36731,92759,8047,3869,51854,1719,75104,409,20662,4197,13109,11,1208,1448,978,4474,1880,1208,18757,24918,5019,95917,359,409,27750,6978,13,19421,39015,11,4864,757,36731,17302,8047,3869,51854,32116,11,81186,1208,1448,978,4474,1880,1208,18757,24918,97958,25945,4244,5512,13,356,17771,25945,3977,46206,27750,6978,13,34447,503,34155,7565,118904,68862,42844,56321,8261,11,1880,503,34155,100162,1744,326,6,9035,13109,43989,908,8047,10253,12104,9769,9004,951,3369,1441,2132,17724,13,19421,272,17771,6316,22710,265,7930,11412,29557,10367,409,75831,6316,41959,97252,35965,8047,7010,653,18111,324,463,1557,5019,3625,6978,7930,82133,68226,513,5534,7420,3869,6316,348,87960,10737,8047,1765,514,7364,3930,7970,383,324,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5084,1093,499,1390,757,311,16343,5361,22755,1139,264,3254,36815,13,578,1495,8111,311,387,304,8753,11,323,433,596,922,279,8271,596,20314,5820,323,1202,4754,8522,304,15419,627,198,8586,374,279,11093,36815,1473,1,7131,499,1440,430,701,8271,5865,1555,18200,30,468,4845,709,11,701,8271,649,2410,264,220,914,2695,1617,29062,13,1115,1436,387,264,40010,369,12208,22012,11,719,369,856,13836,439,264,3995,18247,56447,380,11,279,5915,374,2555,775,13,40551,449,420,18200,311,1505,18699,52312,13,1789,3187,11,1436,584,49853,20314,5820,311,4322,3738,60745,32403,30,7566,11,430,596,1148,814,1650,5655,8271,41959,13,1115,41959,17610,315,46460,287,1403,80390,4871,279,8271,430,690,4667,311,264,42991,430,690,51077,9249,750,304,19815,8271,13,362,2766,1093,264,23744,59775,369,279,4851,13,1115,15105,374,11223,8104,369,6978,449,62145,596,8624,369,8884,24099,6514,11384,3185,6372,13,7566,11,477,25396,939,1197,15419,13,1102,596,28390,315,264,8198,17422,4632,11,719,433,596,539,76939,315,5326,13,4740,264,2478,1667,11,420,41959,1101,11384,3185,6372,1778,439,11689,477,8335,24673,13,70067,41959,304,6246,29973,1122,6978,374,539,30464,311,872,7446,2324,13,2057,9616,11,433,596,1093,10043,31978,520,220,5894,13437,7682,389,904,955,315,5754,13,763,4725,3115,11,499,10737,701,4732,311,279,955,315,5754,323,279,6149,4529,13,393,46396,13,1628,279,6149,4529,13,2057,5766,1521,28093,1055,12242,11,584,1205,311,1505,264,17550,20314,5820,13,358,3152,430,279,41959,1288,387,24473,323,4642,304,279,41959,13,393,46396,13,6914,757,1212,1578,13,2100,11,584,1205,311,1505,264,17550,20314,5820,13,358,12715,279,20314,5820,315,220,4370,6978,304,264,3230,5654,11,902,374,279,1207,31392,4079,62607,13,358,10968,389,3892,5137,315,420,5820,11,1
