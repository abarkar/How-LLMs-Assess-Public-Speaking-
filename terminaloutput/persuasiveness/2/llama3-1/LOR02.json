They mention that our planet has an atmosphere, oceans, and life on its surface, making it a rare gem. The speaker then transitions to talking about their research, which involves analyzing extraterrestrial rocks, including meteorites, moon samples from Apollo missions, and Martian regolith.\n\nThe goal of the research is to determine what type of rocks brought gases that are present in our atmosphere today. The speaker shares their findings, which suggest that the xeon gas in these rocks has a yellow signature. However, when they analyze the xeon in the Earth's atmosphere, they find that it has a green signature, unlike the yellow one from the extraterrestrial rocks.\n\nThe speaker notes that this discrepancy is puzzling and requires an explanation. They propose that comets, which were thought to have been inactive for millions of years, may still be playing a role in shaping our planet's atmosphere. In 2004, the European Space Agency launched the Rosetta mission to study comets, and the speaker notes that this mission found that comets contain xeon with a blue signature.\n\nThe speaker concludes by suggesting that the Earth's atmosphere has an initial yellow color, similar to the composition of meteorites, but it was later modified by the addition of blue-colored cometary material. This modification is what gives our atmosphere its current greenish hue.\n\nOverall, the speech emphasizes the importance of considering extraterrestrial materials and comets in understanding the origin and evolution of our planet's atmosphere.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,5034,10335,265,1826,5016,8065,19910,3930,72601,2092,12267,13,12103,14036,764,12339,11,1208,30179,768,294,6,511,978,598,1880,409,17536,3869,829,7479,3381,294,80720,6316,824,273,9024,13,34447,294,94572,15273,3355,89810,27750,56086,1744,17317,33515,2439,1880,7930,14848,17634,84,29449,3197,66522,14464,481,949,33150,9511,67763,11,503,34155,3869,7643,46096,6316,4526,409,938,8696,11741,977,4014,417,11,18916,28674,951,36252,978,269,3695,11,951,4046,11943,484,2439,33073,17724,123537,5512,951,25664,36250,11,6033,35597,951,2211,484,41670,4046,585,5512,41199,1208,7479,409,21725,13,19421,41091,11,4864,3625,7591,376,9425,11,665,3625,74817,519,55398,81991,3625,21901,265,5019,3127,52424,3625,56086,11741,977,4014,417,1744,27750,938,8696,687,72,89810,13,3959,56086,1744,503,6,44803,325,76826,1880,1744,4864,9616,3869,1208,18528,409,326,6,1334,9049,5485,13,12623,51625,285,42625,11,503,6,44803,325,1208,12223,294,22827,56086,9024,11,514,865,978,6414,11,653,11917,324,887,63497,5019,77807,5615,466,1765,326,6,4775,483,409,326,6,266,8801,764,12339,13,3206,719,11,272,17771,39587,409,7591,23827,261,26077,955,409,938,8696,11741,977,4014,417,14848,18757,1469,90332,1765,10335,265,3625,56086,7930,17317,1218,283,8135,75804,88253,13,2998,21134,39381,11,503,34155,22209,978,514,865,978,6414,76354,7010,3625,938,8696,951,2848,17675,1759,409,1208,10335,265,1880,7930,1323,53377,3869,1208,7479,665,3460,519,1370,3625,4499,66,598,13,16233,18528,1826,3608,2428,3869,73103,3930,865,978,6414,991,652,3416,52235,7010,3625,36252,978,269,3695,13,77533,258,2439,1370,51173,1744,3846,865,978,6414,409,1208,10335,265,1880,951,36252,978,269,3695,45441,409,76651,12203,2957,13,13789,11,1647,80259,11,272,17771,1744,514,865,978,6414,57485,7010,326,6,1334,11,1744,17317,33515,2439,11,66090,409,326,6,266,8801,764,12339,11,308,26248,6502,1208,27584,18528,13,356,17771,22299,4502,11,8065,39381,294,93825,12203,2957,11,3900,43989,409,76651,67861,13,2582,11,42676,4864,1239,42441,1765,7643,27404,409,1069,396,554,11,7930,71925,6960,1208,4526,409,36252,978,269,3695,11,4864,100164,3930,12203,2957,11,4864,100164,27584,3930,85059,11,7930,8024,8065,56086,4046,34965,1370,514,13612,321,13,34447,503,34155,72006,6669,10670,26725,3625,32118,5317,288,2278,21041,11,3900,757,893,593,52842,42625,6316,15119,1557,409,12704,84,5019,3327,72684,20662,76651,67861,3930,865,978,6414,294,6,266,8801,764,12339,13,2998,220,1049,19,11,326,6,351,768,63983,20487,95199,26193,264,60630,978,6316,4538,451,9859,76,8047,16870,27625,5019,48908,665,5589,958,299,1414,6316,47838,8415,97193,409,5634,59307,11741,977,4014,417,13,11876,470,4558,2392,11,27750,30870,645,409,2840,580,1880,409,17258,784,20712,11,2800,14014,3197,447,14014,8065,1913,21901,3930,72601,2092,12267,41199,1208,85434,951,27138,13,362,39002,409,20662,4538,451,63983,20487,513,26483,85,1339,514,27584,14473,1744,66090,1744,503,49963,1082,3869,35336,5019,8678,805,514,865,978,6414,13,5767,17154,220,679,21,11,514,36543,18111,15878,76190,13,8242,29449,27404,409,1069,396,554,11,17317,57038,6316,4538,451,7930,1826,25945,36897,13,62293,20662,27404,409,1069,396,554,6669,68976,11,514,865,978,6414,951,470,4558,2392,44521,1339,6316,18528,12704,361,13,9648,55755,22011,11,1208,10335,265,11,1376,8047,409,5634,59307,92892,17724,10253,36252,978,269,3695,11,264,14707,15925,6316,14036,764,12339,3003,20487,409,76651,12203,2957,13,34447,3900,4498,1339,379,26514,2743,45889,281,2910,14014,62197,1924,409,12704,84,470,978,71237,5019,64290,404,829,18528,1180,31037,11,7930,296,41901,40142,20272,46131,951,5309,288,1880,951,6502,296,30872,417,13,5034,10335,265,1826,39587,5016,11,294,6,21068,359,834,593,27549,841,893,593,6502,294,6,1334,13,7695,8657,285,1339,409,43643,1553,15907,4020,77660,13,27058,85877,408,265,326,6,266,8801,764,12339,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5084,1093,499,617,264,36815,315,264,8982,477,264,31678,922,279,6371,315,9420,596,16975,11,11951,21760,389,279,3560,315,11741,977,53686,7384,323,470,1441,304,46620,1057,11841,596,3805,627,198,791,19114,8638,555,39686,279,60157,315,9420,4315,1023,33975,304,1057,13238,1887,13,2435,6420,430,1057,11841,706,459,16975,11,54280,11,323,2324,389,1202,7479,11,3339,433,264,9024,19269,13,578,19114,1243,34692,311,7556,922,872,3495,11,902,18065,42118,11741,977,53686,23902,11,2737,42142,3695,11,18266,10688,505,36250,25664,11,323,82128,1239,48218,627,198,791,5915,315,279,3495,374,311,8417,1148,955,315,23902,7263,45612,430,527,3118,304,1057,16975,3432,13,578,19114,13551,872,14955,11,902,4284,430,279,865,66130,6962,304,1521,23902,706,264,14071,12223,13,4452,11,994,814,24564,279,865,66130,304,279,9420,596,16975,11,814,1505,430,433,706,264,6307,12223,11,20426,279,14071,832,505,279,11741,977,53686,23902,627,198,791,19114,8554,430,420,79105,374,32854,2785,323,7612,459,16540,13,2435,30714,430,470,1441,11,902,1051,3463,311,617,1027,32899,369,11990,315,1667,11,1253,2103,387,5737,264,3560,304,46620,1057,11841,596,16975,13
