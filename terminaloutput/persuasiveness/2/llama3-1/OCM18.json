It's about a \"cyber-doctor\" who works with crabs (crevettes) to detect environmental pollutants in water. Here's a summary:\n\nThe author introduces himself as the cyber-doctor of crabs, which doesn't mean he's half-robot (I hope!). As humans produce many pollutants that harm the environment, it's essential to monitor water quality continuously. Traditional methods like dosing are limited by the dispersal of pollutants between sampling times.\n\nHistorically, miners used birds as sentinels to detect toxic gases. The author uses a similar concept with crabs, specifically the crab species known as Gammarus (gamard). These crabs' health degrades in the presence of pollutants, serving as an alert signal.\n\nTo detect diseases in humans, doctors measure blood sugar levels. In this case, the author measures biomarkers in crabs to assess their health and determine if they've been exposed to pollutants. This process produces a vast amount of data that must be organized into a database.\n\nThe author compares these biomarkers to a genetic database (ADN) to understand how the crabs react to different pollutants. With an enormous amount of data, it's necessary to use computer programming to analyze it quickly, which is where the cyber-doctor aspect comes in.\n\nTo overcome the challenge of various crab species reacting differently to pollutants, the author focuses on six common European crab species and verifies that the biomarkers work for each of them.\n\nThe text concludes with a humorous anecdote about the author initially thinking it was a joke when they were assigned to work with crabs. However, after three years of collaboration, the author has come to appreciate the crabs' role in detecting environmental dangers and promoting their own health.\n\nOverall, this text is an engaging and informative explanation of how biomarkers can be used to monitor environmental pollution through an innovative partnership between humans and crustaceans!","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,14465,36731,514,21516,30659,302,12844,951,1922,17553,2392,13,63120,11,45602,841,76605,6502,13510,1744,4864,36731,3869,4647,12583,978,653,12585,13,34447,39043,6824,68,665,75249,949,27058,1081,20099,11,22299,9189,514,3665,89,26725,11,3625,4197,35933,2854,33903,2558,285,306,409,81786,7230,84,1821,38605,9533,288,5019,326,41901,2842,40280,13,62463,7230,84,1821,56311,513,38831,15170,7010,326,93847,409,12155,436,33920,31539,13,34447,4068,25692,10539,77680,3125,1208,60128,409,326,93847,949,1952,92215,20028,951,8924,1154,13,9605,513,45347,1339,57375,4502,3625,7230,84,1821,15132,312,15769,5512,7010,326,93847,514,326,56998,1880,934,22827,7330,52760,6155,57332,514,19189,65699,949,11876,8924,1154,78871,51527,11,1841,3625,7230,84,1821,513,78871,79835,5512,13,7695,47090,39587,46524,653,91116,409,6155,9769,1565,665,11885,768,1208,60128,409,326,93847,13,22425,81235,11,3625,10705,1759,4186,10994,1188,951,297,1082,12249,11,259,2053,951,81878,645,11,7930,274,6,1138,5615,85806,409,27114,466,665,30179,768,409,56086,41569,2428,13,622,49963,1082,514,27584,82660,3527,11,829,1739,1744,7643,3288,258,6853,11,272,17771,6316,43905,38920,1922,58330,13,11583,58347,11,514,9192,569,13,19421,7010,29449,4865,11,29449,8450,294,6,5193,68,11,272,17771,2536,6502,6316,523,37645,79828,11,10071,1208,77323,409,29449,1922,58330,11,7930,11412,513,7591,911,1013,665,30179,768,409,7230,84,1821,13,19421,272,17771,39015,1744,1647,42775,409,21516,3055,302,12844,56445,13,27058,85877,440,261,951,8811,17491,11,46206,326,6,87713,11,514,1891,370,66522,1370,51173,11,389,11412,8924,261,951,22337,20243,2482,409,924,846,13,8602,89,1208,1922,58330,11,4864,91507,8924,261,51854,22337,20243,2482,11,11083,86696,16948,919,11,76190,5512,39538,277,593,1759,11,7930,82133,757,29557,10367,409,74282,66014,4538,14240,266,409,77323,11,1880,39587,409,47929,4502,27549,264,24560,665,30179,768,409,7230,84,1821,13,5034,15105,409,47040,409,27750,39538,277,593,1759,17317,3116,45168,6316,80444,294,6,37939,46429,13,2998,5589,6316,11,96308,951,2606,4918,13,19421,5019,68226,958,652,978,466,27750,991,1762,396,288,11,4864,66517,22299,1208,4379,11,4864,3625,9616,3869,6316,2385,409,46681,13,19421,7010,29449,4865,11,27750,46681,11,272,17771,514,3352,6417,63916,78422,99188,409,1208,1922,58330,11,3846,33651,2249,9827,45,13,2009,35881,3655,425,409,326,6,1846,45,54206,951,11990,294,6,41540,811,1744,4864,51441,2942,12329,5019,75831,7643,2385,409,46681,13,8384,4918,11,11990,11,4864,841,94297,6502,514,20028,74206,13,19421,272,17771,5019,39043,1744,4864,36731,653,21516,3055,302,12844,13,622,49963,1082,1647,6141,3357,324,11,1765,514,43014,4864,2082,951,38737,11,5019,68226,8678,805,40744,27750,46681,665,45889,76145,11,3869,1208,2035,409,45889,2606,4918,294,6,1036,14014,13,33150,1620,11,272,17771,653,28800,22299,1208,4379,7330,52760,13,34447,1826,54312,4502,4382,949,61651,14707,2536,13,2998,59157,13109,11,3900,29253,51854,4244,10515,5512,409,1922,17553,2392,13,19421,39587,11,33614,934,6,37907,308,6,546,6502,52842,42625,3625,123299,9004,9517,4109,10253,7230,84,1821,11,7010,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,757,10219,265,1765,3625,4848,4244,10515,5512,409,1922,17553,2392,11,7930,15132,3625,5636,1081,8699,665,4606,13,19421,4864,77680,57609,4502,3625,39538,277,593,1759,34501,77,306,14707,5019,40744,13,4366,346,934,31769,1325,336,479,11,84568,308,6,546,6502,52842,42625,1208,27584,9517,1335,10253,7230,84,1821,11,22299,4864,326,34155,22011,51625,15433,336,479,13,14465,91507,9189,15473,444,466,6316,38920,50750,1295,13,3489,438,389,296,26248,22011,1744,503,65948,2852,58673,15610,1765,1208,1922,58330,11,16953,1133,11,4864,23423,2852,1744,272,96287,6316,1529,4768,13,34447,1913,54960,11,42138,56321,8261,409,17536,79245,11,4864,9189,5534,2852,1744,20662,9192,548,58347,308,17771,6502,934,31109,4382,1922,58330,13,356,17771,653,45165,23349,682,72,978,7010,1208,7591,40241,3930,8137,13,19421,39587,11,4864,5534,2852,1744,11,274,6,14310,3550,409,829,77323,11,272,17771,2773,283,35573,829,77323,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,27387,1495,0,1102,596,922,264,330,11377,655,30659,5009,1,889,4375,449,1589,3518,320,846,17553,2392,8,311,11388,12434,83661,304,3090,13,5810,596,264,12399,512,198,791,3229,40019,5678,439,279,21516,30659,5009,315,1589,3518,11,902,3250,956,3152,568,596,4376,12,18748,320,40,3987,43492,1666,12966,8356,1690,83661,430,11682,279,4676,11,433,596,7718,311,8891,3090,4367,31978,13,46560,5528,1093,8924,287,527,7347,555,279,79835,278,315,83661,1990,25936,3115,627,198,50083,2740,11,43243,1511,20229,439,3288,258,2053,311,11388,21503,45612,13,578,3229,5829,264,4528,7434,449,1589,3518,11,11951,279,60512,9606,3967,439,31079,5730,355,320,40429,569,570,4314,1589,3518,6,2890,409,23142,304,279,9546,315,83661,11,13788,439,459,5225,8450,627,198,1271,11388,19338,304,12966,11,16410,6767,6680,13465,5990,13,763,420,1162,11,279,3229,11193,39538,91141,304,1589,3518,311,8720,872,2890,323,8417,422,814,3077,1027,15246,3
