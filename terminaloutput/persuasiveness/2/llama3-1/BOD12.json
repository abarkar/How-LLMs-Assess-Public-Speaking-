They are likely to grow up to be handsome, tall, and strong, with good health. However, what does this concept have to do with domesticated starlings?\n\nThe author's thesis is to determine if certain individuals among these birds can also \"naître avec une cuillère d'argent dans le bec\" (be born with a silver spoon in their beak). For a starling chick, having a \"cuillère d'argent\" means having attentive parents who choose a safe location for their nest, good weather, an abundance of insects, and peaceful neighbors. When one or more of these elements is missing, the chicks are left vulnerable to predators and hungry, which can cause stress.\n\nThe author's study aims to investigate how this stress affects the health of the starling chicks. To do so, they raised two groups of starlings: one group with artificially increased stress levels by injecting them with a hormone commonly found in birds, corticosterone, and another group with normal stress levels.\n\nOnce the starlings grew up, the author studied their attractiveness to potential mates and parenting abilities. The male starlings have a beard, which is considered sexy. The author measured the length of these beards and found that the starlings with artificially increased stress levels had smaller beards, making them less attractive to females.\n\nHowever, despite being less attractive, these starlings actually became better parents than their unstressed counterparts. They produced more chicks with larger body mass and weights. This suggests that having a \"cuillère d'argent\" in the beak of a starling chick is not essential for becoming a good parent.\n\nPlease let me know if this summary accurately reflects your combined texts!","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,10467,89,45325,3846,1744,1879,57609,326,6,29199,12769,4415,66014,9952,6316,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,7010,1208,30870,1557,8345,949,46408,97583,265,514,20272,934,22827,23496,84,11,53066,294,31109,67628,436,12333,11,40142,16968,3846,934,35329,25400,47090,5019,59394,653,7970,76235,7010,1208,17536,13,7695,35737,15878,85624,294,2182,653,56430,72006,11,6800,11,12108,11,10071,76776,665,7245,483,77323,13,13789,11,10071,26077,1826,514,55520,9465,20662,87810,409,7015,484,12339,1880,3625,4647,483,12249,74522,8467,949,61651,14707,272,17771,16968,326,41901,3841,84,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,7591,23827,261,4502,11,46206,3625,4647,483,12249,28463,11,76076,23496,355,56311,4415,66014,9952,6316,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,7010,514,106508,13,1708,1105,11,4068,25692,10539,7591,5589,404,6316,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,5019,653,17258,784,258,409,4647,483,2933,949,27058,653,17258,784,258,11,272,17771,951,6699,6666,77,5512,7930,73661,79738,653,1689,991,16491,5019,20028,28130,72039,3869,326,6,370,462,951,27389,1045,1759,13,34447,272,17771,28463,653,72006,13612,321,11,653,39646,436,12333,665,27080,288,1880,951,100164,1354,6502,21965,1437,4168,1821,13,445,1105,593,326,22827,409,27750,33013,98942,1826,893,31548,11,1370,51173,11,1208,5103,6853,308,17771,6502,35597,13254,409,4538,39646,11,1880,514,8811,1826,21965,10366,978,3869,19266,1072,556,294,81979,5103,37907,11,3625,17258,784,1354,15132,1208,1056,5512,513,14630,8065,72039,11,3869,1208,16888,72,951,27389,1045,1759,1880,3611,309,5512,13,19421,45602,2605,61652,653,8631,46206,3625,17258,784,1354,13,19421,514,8631,11,9189,665,5804,72,408,23577,11,3846,308,17771,6502,25945,7970,5019,1208,77323,13,622,57286,664,648,39587,5636,51625,285,42625,4068,3846,8631,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,20662,19821,409,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,11,85434,3869,1208,77323,951,17258,784,1354,13,27058,45602,11,17317,57038,4046,3532,978,951,17258,784,1354,409,4647,483,12249,13,81245,14848,24560,9517,4581,285,665,26633,1912,288,12742,82,13,11876,17258,784,1354,3930,21134,57951,14848,312,79884,10878,519,28130,14425,24918,951,45555,2396,294,52152,9885,288,15921,14014,9952,6316,36908,409,8631,25945,9517,79,438,361,46206,3625,297,1082,12249,11,1208,23100,292,537,14081,606,13,356,8458,264,14175,285,294,6,19729,479,261,28130,53052,409,8631,11,14843,285,519,44351,3846,7930,513,39904,5019,653,17258,784,258,4046,3532,978,15878,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,13,11876,17258,784,1354,3930,2132,57951,14848,10484,3869,84440,312,79884,951,45555,2396,294,52152,9885,288,7138,13,81245,14848,39587,24560,4046,3532,5512,7010,951,4787,887,978,3916,11,15878,8631,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,9952,6316,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,7010,514,106508,13,39783,37291,409,1055,355,88025,11,503,34155,14240,21178,978,4068,514,20272,294,49152,13603,24560,47371,3372,285,5512,6033,2536,10878,519,28130,14425,24918,28068,1339,1765,28130,9504,344,13109,1877,31037,1880,28130,23878,13109,3869,409,43406,409,82134,6699,13,1708,1105,11,4068,20272,10539,5019,47929,4502,653,4647,483,2933,1826,72006,342,437,325,949,432,3675,409,5636,4382,13,11876,296,9011,645,4647,483,12249,57485,306,6316,3703,1395,13,19421,11,22299,46206,3625,2854,1771,11,3625,3703,10551,15132,77554,14081,5512,22299,3625,5636,11124,13,622,34155,39587,11083,324,978,1208,1317,79623,409,27750,3703,9620,1880,503,34155,5363,978,7930,951,4647,483,12249,409,12155,26633,1912,288,50590,3625,5636,38546,13,27058,4046,838,8977,3625,20697,21237,2748,3916,951,4647,483,12249,11,503,34155,42587,978,951,12823,409,71132,13,622,34155,55056,978,514,13026,409,86696,934,85217,2558,10994,1188,10878,519,6316,76132,11,44351,1744,1208,62827,1880,514,97418,409,15907,17258,784,1354,13,19421,8065,1620,11,934,17771,54312,1744,39043,264,33537,978,949,622,34155,9466,978,1744,3625,4647,483,12249,7930,308,6,2979,1188,6502,312,79884,409,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,7010,514,106508,10878,519,28130,14425,24918,84764,1188,951,3703,9620,5636,98385,11,39587,46152,97958,40970,11124,1744,43153,1391,31539,13,27058,61512,11,1880,272,17771,39015,653,65285,266,25945,92759,519,11,8811,90966,514,20272,934,85217,264,1188,40970,409,17393,409,2605,78,16339,653,16081,409,272,89412,46206,6316,5103,6853,11,87158,66090,63484,513,54206,11,46152,14848,6316,3703,1395,5636,38920,1744,28130,1391,12339,13,19421,665,5636,11,46152,82133,2558,556,951,17258,784,1354,5636,25500,1880,665,5636,6800,13026,1744,43153,1391,1590,288,13,362,32384,11,6502,63669,409,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,5019,409,43406,653,7970,312,3107,12844,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5084,1093,499,2351,4560,311,16343,1403,22755,25,264,41903,14,46450,950,1495,922,279,7434,315,330,3458,66014,9952,6316,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,7010,1208,30870,1557,1,320,35214,9405,449,264,15310,46605,304,701,11013,8,323,1202,12976,311,279,4007,315,13018,660,6917,19342,627,198,8586,596,856,4879,311,16343,279,22755,512,198,791,7645,330,3458,66014,9952,6316,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,7010,1208,308
