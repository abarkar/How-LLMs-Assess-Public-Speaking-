The journalist is reporting live from the scene and expresses uncertainty about what to say, as scientists have difficulty evaluating whether the forest is healthy or not.\n\nThe journalist explains that while scientists can assess the threats to the forest and its biodiversity, they need more than just the absence of degradation to determine whether the forest is thriving. To address this, the journalist has been working on a thesis that focuses on two main questions: how the forest functions from an ecological perspective and whether current conservation efforts are effective in protecting the forest and its biodiversity.\n\nThe journalist discusses their research findings, which show that 11% of the forest ecosystems in mountainous regions have already shifted towards warmer climates due to climate change. This is a significant finding that highlights the need for urgent action to protect the forest.\n\nThe transcript also touches on the challenges faced by conservation efforts, including soil compaction and invasive exotic species. The journalist concludes by emphasizing that while evaluating the state of the forest is an important step, the ultimate goal is to ensure that the forest remains healthy.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,3436,30854,36731,665,2167,409,9757,8511,901,2933,60630,978,76305,5019,97166,326,57286,266,409,20662,369,49530,13,1708,1105,12155,369,5615,2641,42437,22626,82133,84568,14707,13,29124,66,2182,89,11,4864,100164,409,1208,296,46651,11,951,35641,625,2439,11,951,23962,11,951,82711,31355,11,16968,39043,296,6,326,6,1334,294,6,14283,6502,21965,8811,43584,62408,8486,17194,841,829,275,6502,75249,13510,13,356,17771,4725,5019,326,52152,4811,13,11876,7330,333,8467,14848,48488,409,8811,3869,47929,4502,6316,369,49530,11412,14707,6033,6502,13,81245,11427,306,665,48901,4046,838,8977,3625,3026,2492,7930,281,12416,306,1765,27549,1880,3625,7591,70,9011,2641,1744,45602,25692,20028,1345,2852,1370,45973,11,5019,68226,13510,1744,16968,11412,14707,11,326,6,3518,768,409,7591,49241,841,8657,275,6502,13,356,17771,87320,4864,5320,2249,60946,265,4068,1208,369,49530,34501,818,5019,4046,838,8977,4538,14240,266,294,22827,1486,409,48234,91329,1640,2428,13,34447,514,80259,11,272,17771,934,54386,841,25692,6502,25400,7631,261,11,45575,4068,1744,272,17771,3846,5634,258,30,74656,6033,14707,1208,67628,11,3625,92622,66304,11,3625,9259,13,19421,5019,61512,39043,20272,220,605,8261,1744,503,6,2706,81356,14707,25400,1153,261,1208,3488,13,13789,11,4864,841,36731,39040,339,4558,325,41199,16968,3846,27138,11,10071,41199,220,605,8261,11,9952,11083,4631,4558,70,1157,11,17317,14240,664,919,3625,4046,9594,599,66474,13952,4918,1880,28130,56594,1986,13109,5019,19477,52750,951,13519,1759,409,924,33920,409,28130,14240,266,91329,1640,2428,13,1952,513,62163,11,1370,51173,11,409,74940,7479,6316,369,49530,264,63669,5019,513,52895,716,409,85722,7706,1604,6033,35597,1208,10484,13109,409,66304,10237,100243,5019,2018,8977,3869,31518,404,3625,2092,82,13,34447,3663,8065,893,593,409,390,46302,11,3900,379,264,45889,65838,11,389,274,17771,259,3514,978,5553,1208,38317,13,4418,66,11,9952,514,65827,3675,409,1647,4046,61673,11,503,34155,59062,978,6316,270,4558,325,7010,1208,88265,4864,757,17477,26633,4860,13,5034,55133,3613,68495,514,9517,6583,1386,1133,11323,266,2428,13,11876,7330,333,8467,14848,7591,1677,376,978,4538,5536,1765,3625,6136,288,11,10071,389,893,593,35597,409,100246,1765,3625,4046,9594,599,66474,13,622,34155,39587,24560,23008,9211,951,2606,4918,409,79415,5512,409,6136,288,86595,5512,1765,5636,294,22827,97739,9326,1880,4864,3625,16796,51010,28111,5512,7010,6316,25945,25626,2385,409,46681,13,622,41901,16796,7591,47348,3625,4595,409,369,5615,2641,7010,3625,447,2053,46152,84764,1188,24560,86595,5512,13,19421,503,34155,18757,48021,665,4046,28580,1744,46939,665,20605,24812,11,220,806,1034,951,4046,9594,599,66474,13952,4918,14848,4046,12821,96559,5553,951,7625,53819,5636,70412,82,934,49152,519,13,220,806,4,272,17771,653,30870,273,4550,479,46939,77554,14081,481,13,19421,1370,543,4558,1001,3869,39043,11,294,81979,3026,2492,84764,1188,24560,3608,13215,14014,41199,1317,67380,11,22299,1370,51173,514,259,13559,479,951,2092,82,6033,35597,3625,16948,4558,1634,506,354,8467,6233,1494,1056,15844,13,356,17771,87320,11,41199,3625,65838,220,1954,11,326,48968,4176,17317,21559,951,1665,22589,1880,3625,52138,729,294,6,351,404,13,11876,13952,4918,2322,73468,39587,665,2035,951,6299,1765,514,25911,5019,1760,978,1414,1208,369,49530,1880,829,56594,1986,13109,13,34447,1913,54960,11,1826,54312,1744,39043,15572,68,39043,30,356,17771,1208,26633,90272,3488,1744,4864,757,17477,13,9589,54312,1744,3625,3435,8467,78511,14295,665,282,525,324,409,1208,17332,11159,13109,15132,31914,2492,30,9589,54312,1744,12155,9045,15132,8657,285,1821,30,27058,39043,4864,91507,93455,3625,369,5615,2641,7930,15132,1760,19395,14014,9952,19637,645,7930,514,15132,1069,21719,11,66021,1744,11,8065,1620,11,29449,1665,333,308,17771,6502,71357,409,47929,4068,82133,3625,369,5615,2641,13,19421,39043,11,39043,308,17771,934,31109,14240,2070,13,5034,1620,13109,11,272,17771,934,6,37907,779,1188,665,7970,14240,266,13,14465,15119,1557,3930,66304,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2028,8111,311,387,264,36815,315,264,23672,596,31710,389,279,1614,315,264,13952,304,9757,8511,901,2933,11,9822,13,578,23672,374,13122,3974,505,279,6237,323,61120,27924,922,1148,311,2019,11,439,14248,617,17250,38663,3508,279,13952,374,9498,477,539,627,198,791,23672,15100,430,1418,14248,649,8720,279,18208,311,279,13952,323,1202,73119,11,814,1205,810,1109,1120,279,19821,315,53568,311,8417,3508,279,13952,374,53414,13,2057,2686,420,11,279,23672,706,1027,3318,389,264,17850,430,24400,389,1403,1925,4860,25,1268,279,13952,5865,505,459,50953,13356,323,3508,1510,29711,9045,527,7524,304,22973,279,13952,323,1202,73119,627,198,791,23672,35434,872,3495,14955,11,902,1501,430,220,806,4,315,279,13952,61951,304,16700,788,13918,617,2736,30073,7119,46039,92399,4245,311,10182,2349,13,1115,374,264,5199,9455,430,22020,279,1205,369,34771,1957,311,6144,279,13952,627,198,791,36815,1101,29727,389,279,11774,17011,555,29711,9045,11,2737,17614,1391,1335,323,53354,39418,9606,13,578,23672,
