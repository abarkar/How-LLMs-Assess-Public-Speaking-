The speaker is reflecting on their own experience as an anthropologist, specifically referencing a TV show called \"Rendez-vous en terre inconnue\" where celebrities immerse themselves in the lives of distant populations.\n\nThe speaker then shares their own experience living with a population of around 300 people in an isolated Tibetan village at an altitude of 35,000 meters. They describe their method of research as observation participante, which involves building relationships and earning the trust of the local people through shared meals, language learning, and social interactions.\n\nThe speaker mentions that their initial contact was difficult, but they eventually gained acceptance from a local family and were able to participate in daily life. They highlight the importance of this experience for understanding the evolution of knowledge transmission within the community, particularly with regards to traditional Tibetan medicine practiced by two local doctors, Yeshi and Norbu.\n\nThe speaker notes that they observed significant intergenerational changes between Yeshi (the father) and Norbu (the son), who has had access to modern education and training. This has led to innovations in the community's medical practices, such as the production of medicinal incense sold to tourists.\n\nThe final section of the transcript discusses the anthropological perspective on understanding human societies and how they evolve over time. The speaker concludes that anthropology involves immersing oneself in \"terra incognita\" (unknown land) to gain a deeper understanding of what makes us human beings.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,7695,379,264,6316,4046,2796,43116,7930,274,53149,6853,12769,432,73602,45325,665,88026,304,5259,361,8345,7010,1208,88265,6316,272,29982,32414,978,961,274,6,19519,1414,7010,1208,17536,294,31109,7187,781,396,8511,13,23126,729,11,39043,757,61158,6853,3846,1744,4864,66517,11,10071,1208,2373,2536,32118,8747,266,2428,11,326,6,32329,897,38469,13,445,6,32329,897,38469,274,55624,978,22550,665,67781,10253,96642,30811,65970,2854,33903,1880,17317,22114,3869,48021,665,13356,29449,83187,3941,409,17536,13,19421,41091,11,27549,1826,39723,7643,88026,304,5259,361,949,38891,89,11,409,38546,20605,3326,288,665,818,343,14014,11,653,14458,3869,220,1758,410,296,75104,294,6,99111,11,6316,7187,8065,436,556,51794,11,3869,1208,49361,5954,77,37093,11,65198,11,4160,556,272,287,75,5048,11,17317,74533,7010,653,14458,409,326,68070,2931,12874,13,356,17771,39015,1481,300,1744,503,34155,81621,56321,37291,11,51854,46415,11,3869,18434,265,665,75657,7010,6316,7187,294,6,4775,483,259,581,10515,8511,294,41901,2842,220,3101,14464,1821,13,622,34155,25160,9952,27750,47104,11,1048,951,2807,417,9952,27750,47104,11,44314,978,28130,96282,13,27058,62998,949,4366,346,1744,272,17771,1208,98652,409,38317,409,1647,96839,294,57286,29246,11,326,6,79060,5293,5048,13,1952,1370,273,9952,3625,47104,11,389,3625,2322,665,2389,5397,1880,46152,17317,7591,34667,8135,6316,49361,5954,77,37093,13,13789,11,4864,841,9189,6636,6502,1744,514,21134,3729,1826,653,28800,77411,13,14465,757,5945,10176,729,11,4864,9189,16796,665,5589,1448,680,978,3869,1208,60172,294,22827,14458,30148,42676,11,6502,409,90509,13,1252,47838,14458,30148,39904,1880,757,22011,11,665,20272,11,13088,6868,285,6853,11,3900,47090,5790,95920,11,3900,841,47090,6502,1448,3183,13,622,6,40997,11,503,6,1683,6091,7010,1208,36105,44526,20487,11,99309,20043,2249,436,51058,757,5363,306,294,22827,3805,37539,11067,13,1952,296,6,10543,68,1913,54960,11,389,757,113147,514,76680,1880,5636,503,41901,66304,11,5636,389,296,41901,594,805,265,13,14465,841,11427,2852,6502,4068,5790,95920,11,4864,841,63762,5636,4068,31632,13,34447,1913,54960,11,4864,36731,1370,7287,3869,18434,265,7010,20662,67628,7010,1208,88265,3900,379,264,26633,32118,8332,1354,259,581,10515,1771,11,816,4385,72,514,281,12339,1880,8170,20218,514,89672,11,7930,55744,5118,306,6316,32118,8332,483,409,28130,14135,259,581,10515,8511,13,19421,272,17771,39043,7930,296,55624,978,22550,13,62463,26633,32118,8332,1354,55744,5118,306,7010,28130,47276,1880,3381,43153,35030,292,24469,3869,2385,409,6136,288,10253,447,37907,46152,14848,1046,12416,13,19421,7643,270,4558,325,60172,1765,326,31769,65272,951,92096,409,3846,47929,35030,950,13,19421,1765,3846,7930,2349,9465,1208,95234,409,816,4385,72,11,514,281,12339,11,1880,409,8170,20218,11,514,89672,13,4418,66,934,17771,54312,1744,503,6,49133,949,622,6,49133,665,20272,653,26495,978,958,70,32453,2214,8301,3062,13,816,4385,72,11,514,281,12339,11,264,917,6091,8065,14458,9952,4538,281,12339,28463,13,1708,1105,1744,4538,89672,8170,20218,264,18757,48908,7010,6316,4046,56745,409,32118,8332,483,259,581,10515,8511,11,3900,264,15925,1046,12416,3869,653,47929,5636,3544,1880,3900,264,18757,23933,1435,665,20522,1748,13,19421,75804,88253,11,3900,45640,1880,3900,95234,409,5636,665,5636,665,20522,1748,13,7695,513,17302,68,3869,409,80080,58395,3930,38900,934,35329,39474,68,3869,4538,14458,13,24703,7930,20272,1744,829,14135,6301,1009,13,4418,66,3900,11412,1370,51173,11,20028,665,5636,409,15907,35030,292,24469,11,409,326,6,967,729,35030,292,992,934,35329,19189,10253,31070,288,409,21765,13,3489,301,593,14896,1744,4538,281,12339,308,26248,6502,3930,16968,917,43711,5979,978,8065,65385,11,10071,934,35329,264,4287,978,46110,3869,46110,13,435,2259,1001,11,816,4385,72,11,514,281,12339,11,757,22011,1744,97507,11,14707,97717,11,1208,17536,8065,14458,75804,88253,11,27549,1826,5636,51794,13,34447,3900,841,4160,275,5636,22299,33670,11,951,53542,1765,3625,3091,6723,2249,45740,414,404,1208,20605,24812,13,7695,513,62163,7930,1826,54312,7930,35456,969,829,16578,5019,2515,8977,3625,21889,61244,409,1709,14081,3416,4502,4538,89672,1826,79988,1208,4647,12583,978,409,326,6,85335,665,20272,13,4418,66,272,17771,39043,326,6,32329,897,38469,13,356,17771,22842,4068,4046,12821,361,6316,77824,13,356,17771,274,6,19519,1414,665,88026,304,5259,361,5019,60946,265,3846,7930,20272,409,17317,951,20183,45632,2854,1771,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2028,374,264,36815,315,459,7855,14975,477,15864,11,4461,505,279,2115,315,95044,13,578,19114,374,42852,389,872,1866,3217,439,459,41416,16549,11,11951,57616,264,6007,1501,2663,330,49,73602,45325,665,88026,304,5259,361,1,1405,40501,26612,325,5694,304,279,6439,315,29827,22673,627,198,791,19114,1243,13551,872,1866,3217,5496,449,264,7187,315,2212,220,3101,1274,304,459,25181,73074,14458,520,459,36958,315,220,1758,11,931,20645,13,2435,7664,872,1749,315,3495,439,22695,5293,5048,11,902,18065,4857,12135,323,28744,279,7095,315,279,2254,1274,
