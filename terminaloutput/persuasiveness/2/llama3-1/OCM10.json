It appears to be a presentation or speech about the importance of protecting the ocean's deep-sea ecosystems and the creatures that inhabit them.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the text:\n\nThe speaker begins by describing the planet as a small blue sphere surrounded by an immense universe, emphasizing the significance of the ocean floor. They highlight that despite its seeming insignificance, the ocean floor is home to a vast array of life forms that are crucial for maintaining the balance of our ecosystem.\n\nThe speaker then laments the fact that these deep-sea creatures are facing increasing threats due to human activities such as mining and exploitation of resources like lithium, cobalt, and rare earths. They emphasize the need for better regulations and a more effective way to monitor and evaluate the impact of human activities on this mysterious ecosystem.\n\nThe speaker shares their own experience in studying these deep-sea creatures using traditional methods like microscopy, which can be time-consuming and labor-intensive. However, they have developed a new approach that uses environmental DNA (eDNA) extracted directly from the ocean floor to detect the presence of all life forms, including those that are invisible to the naked eye.\n\nThe speaker explains how this eDNA contains specific genes that are common among all living organisms, allowing for the identification of species and the creation of a biodiversity map of the deep-sea ecosystems. They conclude by quoting La Fontaine's saying \"On a souvent besoin d'un plus petit que soi\" (\"One often needs something smaller than oneself\"), highlighting the importance of protecting these tiny creatures that are essential to our own survival.\n\nOverall, this transcript conveys a sense of urgency and passion for preserving the ocean's deep-sea ecosystems and the incredible diversity of life that thrives there.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,48109,14464,2439,6316,43905,38920,3197,66522,7010,653,38883,11159,13,48109,326,53149,301,2439,71151,1208,3197,66522,12704,361,13,34447,7010,16968,3846,12704,84,11,3900,379,264,409,1208,30870,68,11,409,1208,34316,283,68,88314,1604,7930,1421,283,49606,514,21901,951,296,388,13,10467,89,45325,11,11083,67,986,11,9622,46138,11,1744,20662,30870,68,11,272,17771,1208,4647,12583,978,409,1208,7479,409,1208,10335,265,949,9878,66522,34316,283,68,11,389,3567,14687,13510,13,2582,11,20662,30870,68,11,30547,3869,12155,20043,2249,11,671,1269,653,11159,1370,543,51453,294,6,2910,3433,4893,98385,293,90276,11,98385,11,97507,11,10071,4043,306,13327,645,5019,326,31769,447,31059,265,409,29449,3197,66522,13,3341,84568,15132,653,7643,43588,3062,409,1208,13826,25108,818,38450,12267,951,18274,978,598,1880,76776,11,84568,264,1748,3869,1421,10993,1208,5634,20712,7930,10390,1395,409,1208,7479,409,326,93847,13,8560,75876,43765,11,27750,98385,293,90276,15132,409,5636,665,5636,3026,582,14014,1370,3625,4197,35933,2854,33903,13,48109,18434,2439,665,3846,4545,6316,3388,3869,326,6,2227,1133,5019,326,6,69331,7709,409,12155,14733,288,88314,3916,13,19421,97507,11,326,6,28400,467,1826,550,49530,3869,79942,78,7215,514,21901,951,296,388,11,5019,665,5066,556,951,1332,76743,2249,11,22299,514,57907,11,514,34928,3223,6033,3625,2024,417,436,5518,13,1708,1105,11,3900,17317,47090,409,31326,1439,38682,1001,811,5019,1760,978,1414,3846,4809,588,4618,2249,10071,4502,11679,35285,2249,4046,9594,599,25253,13,48109,57038,63669,294,31109,98652,31914,580,5019,98054,9621,326,52152,12887,409,12155,88314,288,1880,68226,4046,838,8977,326,6,58400,409,12155,4197,35933,7010,42067,11159,7930,17317,3429,77422,4502,781,396,467,1880,7930,1826,5019,61512,4502,463,1557,409,17317,13,81578,8301,1001,11,4068,2267,6948,5392,788,949,61651,14707,11,17317,58724,951,76145,11,951,49301,11,951,5347,33903,11,4160,556,951,46415,8065,73757,3869,5363,261,9465,3625,41936,409,274,481,5019,379,23008,9211,27750,98385,293,90276,13,19421,3900,379,665,264,628,978,339,461,11,951,2960,33903,11,951,2606,4918,1370,3273,625,8047,409,34316,788,11,951,67094,582,2601,11,951,6293,102504,2601,11,951,38605,8637,2601,11,951,1499,5759,4558,2392,1880,27584,951,62197,5346,3536,11,27750,47120,288,64555,17724,7930,31807,18620,3869,40744,3625,4787,409,17536,11,27584,3869,19637,645,409,326,77025,1330,13,2009,80259,949,356,17771,1744,514,73757,11,39043,35456,3930,27138,13,19421,389,264,63669,294,31109,98652,5636,76608,5019,48908,3869,1208,27584,348,87960,1744,326,6,485,592,7379,13,1708,1105,7010,7643,270,4558,325,11,503,6,19680,1082,6316,48659,3057,1557,11,5636,31914,580,1841,27549,29557,409,85877,440,261,16968,326,6,277,21152,3930,18434,519,13,622,49963,1082,326,6,1846,45,50026,40280,278,1744,503,6,15824,285,2167,1133,409,1208,30870,68,88314,1604,13,7695,687,1188,326,6,1846,45,409,40744,3625,98385,293,90276,7930,379,18434,306,13,14465,1239,42441,76826,951,342,4558,4978,51625,285,11,951,342,4558,4978,665,34561,3869,26725,3625,47120,288,18434,1821,13,65381,9189,11,3869,41091,1880,3869,84568,13,62463,342,4558,4978,11,3846,15132,951,342,4558,4978,2082,16150,417,7930,29557,73468,11,665,3625,7591,20720,519,11,294,6,16288,3625,16948,4558,1634,30179,21938,13,2895,66096,3869,20662,48659,98652,11,665,22209,519,951,30870,288,88314,3916,27389,3532,14014,961,412,7010,514,38900,11,4864,1589,8047,6316,7558,3257,648,409,1208,56594,1986,13109,409,12155,94527,21901,82,3678,1354,13,5034,9757,8511,264,22011,12769,1952,264,71151,63669,294,22827,5636,46110,1744,779,72,13,8345,48109,514,23933,2439,17317,1474,5615,9004,13,51097,293,533,978,4108,39408,2259,645,15132,4043,306,13327,645,13,4072,645,15132,4043,306,13327,645,3869,29449,17536,13,1708,1105,11,61158,301,2439,5392,788,1744,3846,5636,46110,1744,779,72,11,3900,25692,23761,88314,278,13,19421,1760,978,713,2439,12155,21901,82,3678,1354,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,32,27387,36815,0,1102,8111,311,387,264,15864,477,8982,922,279,12939,315,22973,279,18435,596,5655,7962,64,61951,323,279,20566,430,33427,1124,627,198,8586,596,264,31085,315,279,1495,512,198,791,19114,12302,555,23524,279,11841,439,264,2678,6437,26436,23712,555,459,38883,15861,11,82003,279,26431,315,279,18435,6558,13,2435,11415,430,8994,1202,76795,54127,100104,11,279,18435,6558,374,2162,311,264,13057,1358,315,2324,7739,430,527,16996,369,20958,279,8335,315,1057,26031,627,198,791,19114,1243,326,24469,279,2144,430,1521,5655,7962,64,20566,527,13176,7859,18208,4245,311,3823,7640,1778,439,11935,323,40761,315,5070,1093,57907,11,34928,3223,11,323,9024,9578,82,13,2435,47032,279,1205,369,2731,14640,323,264,810,7524,1648,311,8891,323,15806,279,5536,315,3823,7640,389,420,26454,26031,627,198,791,19114,13551,872,1866,3217,304,21630,1521,5655,7962,64,20566,1701,8776,5528,1093,92914,11,902,649,387,892,70840,323,9511,88092,13,4452,11,814,617,8040,264,502,5603,430,5829,12434,15922,320,68,56420,8,28532,6089,505,279,18435,6558,311,11388,
