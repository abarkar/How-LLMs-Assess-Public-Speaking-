I myself have lost some companions, and perhaps you too. I think particularly of the young foals who lived on the farm next to my parents' when I was younger, and unfortunately didn't survive. In this war, we have a common enemy. Both humans and animals - terrestrial, marine, insects, birds, and even plants - are affected by it. Our common enemy is the parasitic worm. These worms are everywhere and come in all shapes and sizes. Some are microscopic and live in soil, and those are very good for the environment. On the other hand, others are very nasty and parasitize almost all living species on this planet. In humans, one person out of two is infested or has been infested. So look at your neighbor to the left, your neighbor to the right. If it's not you, maybe your neighbor is infested. I can't handle all the parasites that exist on this earth, so I'll focus on the one that traumatized me in my childhood. This worm in horses causes respiratory and digestive troubles and can lead to animal death. We still have an arsenal against this worm, a molecule called ivermectin. Ivermectin was commercialized in the 80s, so it's been 40 years. And that's where the problem is. Just like with antibiotics and bacteria, these worms have developed resistance to this molecule. That's where I come in. The goal of my thesis is to understand how ivermectin works on this parasite, because we still don't know after 40 years, and to understand the mechanisms involved in resistance development for developing new strategies.\n\nSo we have some leads. We know that ivermectin acts on the nervous system of the parasite, specifically on receptors. These receptors are composed of five subunits, like five fingers, and allow or block a nerve message depending on whether the receptor opens or closes. So the parasitic worm has an idea, like moving, eating, reproducing. The idea passes through this receptor and triggers action - eating, moving, reproducing. Ivermectin, on the other hand, binds to this receptor and prevents the parasite from realizing its actions. Therefore, the parasite is paralyzed and will die. But if the parasite is resistant, ivermectin cannot bind to the receptor, and the parasite will live freely in the horse.\n\nSo the goal of my thesis is already to identify these receptors and find the right composition of subunits for the receptor to be functional, and then study the interactions between this receptor and ivermectin, the molecule involved in treating this parasite. In a second step, I'll focus on the mutations that have developed resistance on this receptor to develop a new strategy and bypass the resistance. So you can count on me to save the foals; I'll give it my all.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,4241,9425,1208,85434,951,27138,11,3900,29253,6316,1709,67100,513,5192,66522,7930,264,46939,20272,951,11990,409,10237,82,13,622,34155,41091,98375,824,1072,76076,83491,2439,11,1880,15878,294,2182,1744,9189,28463,13,14465,73953,81186,10253,60120,281,11206,1771,7930,348,10126,1188,7010,1208,18728,2727,3869,81337,409,46206,11083,6699,11,42676,503,31769,2629,285,5636,36963,11,1880,7930,308,6,546,8811,75876,43765,6502,7550,20243,84,13,46706,20662,1709,67100,11,17317,57038,653,61624,22530,34561,13,48109,11,3625,2854,1771,11,10071,44767,3625,4039,12249,11,934,85217,779,1188,2024,4014,417,6033,3678,1354,11,9952,3625,27080,288,11,3625,297,1082,12249,11,1880,27584,3625,348,19395,978,2629,2249,13,356,295,61624,22530,34561,11,272,17771,514,2807,85573,13,11876,5553,79383,15132,961,412,1880,15132,409,40744,9986,645,13,15663,1771,15132,8162,2445,454,8467,1880,18434,306,7010,514,2092,11,1880,66056,2922,6496,15132,25945,14707,5019,326,41901,2842,40280,13,2998,5891,29097,11,294,81979,15132,25945,32118,99906,1880,33403,275,306,934,300,3904,40744,3625,16948,4558,1634,18434,15844,1765,20662,3197,66522,13,8602,89,326,6,87713,11,6316,54613,1765,26633,1826,4225,478,8047,6033,264,24560,4225,478,8047,13,4418,66,1239,42441,89,15265,4160,58504,3869,15265,96721,11,15265,4160,58504,3869,15265,7118,635,13,12095,3846,308,17771,6502,9189,11,272,17771,25692,85815,15265,4160,58504,7930,1826,4225,478,978,13,14465,841,94297,6502,296,6,14310,3550,409,26725,3625,79383,7930,3073,306,1765,20662,88026,11,39587,4864,91507,757,17576,261,1765,66090,3930,3091,838,7930,296,26248,9781,372,3689,978,7010,1647,33632,685,13,24703,5553,11,46206,514,3091,838,11,83786,25108,818,951,35665,33515,4428,3946,1880,21552,22589,1880,25692,83786,25108,1215,1208,10237,409,326,6,48999,13,1952,264,42676,27584,6316,802,2727,45973,3846,5553,11,6316,22337,20243,1130,7930,274,53149,6853,326,6,1553,76,440,483,13,445,6,1553,76,440,483,264,24560,8518,285,8047,7010,3625,65838,220,1490,11,39587,3900,379,264,220,1272,8261,13,19421,272,17771,39015,39723,1826,514,80259,13,356,17771,1744,41199,11,22299,5019,3625,33209,8467,1880,3625,293,533,978,4108,11,3625,5553,14848,68866,978,951,31807,380,3095,3869,20662,22337,20243,1130,13,19421,272,17771,39015,39723,503,6,40997,665,51655,13,2009,719,409,7643,270,4558,325,1826,409,60946,265,4068,326,6,1553,76,440,483,34501,818,1765,3846,85573,11,66021,934,54386,841,514,829,275,44093,6502,3869,326,6,75876,1180,31037,11,27584,42138,220,1272,8261,11,1880,409,60946,265,3625,32118,4919,2191,288,409,31807,4011,11866,5118,5512,45973,20662,22337,20243,1130,5019,52895,716,409,80080,44397,19395,552,409,63922,668,13,4418,66,389,264,42676,27584,45889,24817,288,13,1952,829,275,1744,326,6,1553,76,440,483,945,275,1765,514,72601,32015,2249,3930,85573,11,39587,4538,272,5976,2933,11,1880,5636,51625,285,42625,1765,951,9517,1512,38647,13,62463,9517,1512,38647,15132,40321,5512,409,272,6009,32592,61675,5512,11,22299,272,6009,656,343,2641,11,1880,29557,73468,514,21765,6033,6502,294,22827,1984,32015,2249,46932,519,1744,514,9517,1512,12844,274,6,283,49606,6033,513,18728,2727,13,4418,66,514,5553,85573,264,6316,887,8047,11,22299,30870,1414,11,296,4091,11,513,14843,556,13,445,27688,8047,39904,3869,30517,3846,9517,1512,12844,1880,83786,25108,818,326,91655,11,39587,296,4091,11,30870,1414,11,513,14843,556,13,445,6,1553,76,440,483,11,27549,11,11412,513,5155,261,1765,3846,9517,1512,12844,1880,8654,5615,9211,514,5553,409,59157,12329,40744,15907,6299,13,4418,66,514,5553,1826,1370,278,1065,978,1880,11412,67683,404,13,34447,4502,514,5553,1826,31807,11451,11,326,6,1553,76,440,483,841,5019,969,56316,513,5155,261,1765,514,9517,1512,12844,11,1880,3930,16081,514,5553,11412,18434,265,48647,479,11,7010,514,3091,838,13,4418,66,514,719,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,272,17771,46939,294,6,16288,27750,9517,1512,38647,1880,409,46524,1208,51651,18528,665,32592,61675,5512,5019,1744,3846,9517,1512,12844,45441,34501,8301,11,1880,3930,16081,14240,664,1291,3625,22639,409,3846,9517,1512,12844,9952,326,6,1553,76,440,483,11,1208,22337,20243,1130,7930,1826,11866,5118,8047,11,7930,1826,42587,8047,5019,18027,261,3846,85573,13,46706,653,26633,90272,27138,11,4864,91507,296,55624,978,676,261,10253,34684,409,31807,4011,934,35329,379,264,1765,3846,9517,1512,12844,5019,52895,716,6316,48659,44397,19395,648,1880,42533,1215,1208,31807,4011,13,4418,66,9189,45366,55056,261,1765,41091,11,5019,33254,424,3625,281,606,1065,11,4864,91507,16968,71751,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,271,9,9,49873,25823,334,198,198,12834,279,3814,315,3115,11,1070,706,1027,264,6367,4208,430,706,2736,11922,11990,315,6439,13,358,7182,617,5675,1063,41957,11,323,8530,499,2288,13,358,1781,8104,315,279,3995,12018,1147,889,12439,389,279,8961,1828,311,856,6699,6,994,358,574,14992,11,323,26907,3287,956,18167,13,763,420,4208,11,584,617,264,4279,9354,13,11995,12966,323,10099,482,80492,11,29691,11,41911,11,20229,11,323,1524,11012,482,527,11754,555,433,13,5751,
