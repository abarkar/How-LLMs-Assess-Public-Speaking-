They highlight the benefits of using this natural material, including its eco-friendliness, carbon storage capacity, and recyclability.\n\nThe speaker then introduces the two main ingredients: earth crue and hemp fibers. Earth crue is a type of soil that is simple yet complex in its composition, which depends on various factors such as argillaceous content. Hemp fibers are another key component, with their tiny particles resembling wood and having a high porosity rate.\n\nThe speaker notes that there are at least as many types of hemp as there are types of earth, making it essential to study the size and water-absorption properties of these particles to create an \"earth allégée\" (a lightweight earth mixture).\n\nTo test the performance of this material without having to create countless blends, the speaker shares their approach: collecting 30 samples from different regions in Brittany and Normandy, then testing them under precise conditions. They also conducted laboratory tests to understand why certain mixtures worked better than others.\n\nWith these data points in hand, the speaker was able to select five representative earths and three hemp types that exhibited distinct behaviors. By mixing these materials in various proportions, they were able to create blends with excellent mechanical properties, high thermal insulation capacity, and exceptional humidity management capabilities.\n\nThe project also involves participatory research, collaborating with artisans and developers of simple tests for construction sites to ensure the quality and consistency of the final product.\n\nThroughout the presentation, the speaker emphasizes the importance of diversity in creating sustainable solutions for the future.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,9424,1055,10333,45325,11,60404,11,3625,86696,281,64272,5512,3869,1208,86451,949,61651,14707,41091,11,503,41901,16796,20272,1647,42775,13,14465,39904,1208,4647,12583,978,409,11083,503,3514,14014,11,3625,69236,7010,1208,30870,68,11,3869,20028,951,86696,281,64272,5512,13,19421,4864,3625,84921,9952,51625,1854,13,36684,58673,2249,409,38317,13263,3869,57705,978,6091,261,653,13399,519,30945,2428,887,63497,5019,514,293,64272,3904,13,7695,42182,23761,514,5636,91329,1640,2428,1880,514,5636,2804,519,3284,13,1952,25692,514,9765,462,16339,1685,593,961,412,1765,10335,265,11,9952,71686,56321,81336,15433,4167,11,1744,326,54386,46524,64,44093,1353,54960,13,7695,841,54206,85624,7591,40213,11,3900,5708,68,48488,409,1841,20337,11,1880,665,5636,11,389,25692,514,1421,10993,3869,326,52152,5589,72,13,356,17771,3709,3433,481,758,27058,47929,3846,1744,272,17771,11,28068,2439,3869,1208,3488,5019,653,7643,53510,13,7777,11,21134,81336,15433,1188,13,7054,758,3489,301,5634,28154,2933,409,8246,44260,496,1604,11,57485,3869,1208,37291,7010,1208,8309,52009,409,921,483,1880,7010,514,523,69628,2933,409,650,92512,14081,569,11,1826,264,4972,72,4382,11,10071,25945,6485,68,11,1841,25945,3977,949,507,2005,11,1208,88026,1589,361,13,46706,11083,58673,2249,11,4864,326,57286,664,648,3869,96642,4046,331,37907,5019,665,7591,23827,261,15907,40321,1821,11,81186,3625,1417,3742,13,3459,37854,14480,7138,66601,13,7777,11,26633,90272,81336,15433,1188,13,7054,758,3489,6853,628,5048,11,15890,3625,16178,417,14848,55505,3869,1208,59251,951,23125,1154,951,5636,94527,293,349,12249,11,264,653,36271,7930,513,282,3972,5986,978,43310,949,507,2005,11,97507,11,514,27114,49606,13,362,326,55624,57663,409,1208,259,7404,11,389,71451,409,98385,2598,2482,594,28111,519,8065,66304,11,25945,73083,31539,11,1841,7245,1572,409,4247,437,13109,13,356,17771,84568,7930,1469,90332,546,514,68226,13399,519,13,2009,490,1791,11,272,17771,934,35329,379,264,8065,40970,3154,519,409,27114,49606,1744,409,35641,13,1708,1105,11,5019,3625,44178,63934,1291,11,503,57286,664,648,1208,62827,951,2598,2482,1880,28130,23878,13109,3869,15938,655,409,326,93847,13,44031,5317,978,3869,29449,8348,13532,25253,81336,15433,1188,11,326,93847,11,17317,64290,2439,3846,934,54386,917,6853,6316,88026,682,19395,8047,13,43987,26178,11,4068,14240,664,1291,3625,24601,409,20662,88026,682,19395,8047,15878,20028,951,2606,81560,409,32118,5317,288,11,10071,665,864,52985,665,42463,20662,9765,1130,817,21797,13109,949,61651,14707,11,41091,7930,86807,100196,11,503,34155,20272,653,68082,13,622,34155,52579,11083,11176,288,1880,7643,281,6853,11,1880,4864,36731,79988,3869,30517,43905,1208,72777,24812,1880,1208,20935,438,648,11,2536,6502,5019,3625,9517,41546,321,1291,11,10071,5019,9517,2119,466,220,966,2024,417,1744,503,34155,87885,2353,14014,8065,2092,11,65735,653,1760,511,1286,51625,285,5019,665,7591,23827,261,28130,52962,1133,11,665,34501,409,28130,259,1994,324,665,384,2933,13,14465,757,38831,83384,35597,9952,951,86696,281,64272,5512,13,34447,1208,44178,16271,9952,41091,11,16968,46110,11,272,17771,1744,503,34155,20272,951,4043,2852,665,9511,67763,5019,15522,3212,4839,1133,87320,1647,46110,281,64272,978,259,1188,6033,6502,13,41757,412,978,10253,46681,951,2027,38647,409,27114,49606,11,503,34155,45575,409,75249,90194,951,2024,417,1880,951,27114,85,417,10253,52962,3808,25945,85114,13,19421,39015,11,69428,758,14465,757,38831,83384,9952,220,20,2024,417,91678,5983,409,16968,326,88766,3121,1880,220,18,27114,85,417,91678,5983,409,43905,1208,9822,13,62293,11083,2024,417,1880,11083,27114,85,417,73661,552,11,4864,59157,1082,951,32118,5317,288,11,44829,503,57286,664,648,43153,24601,13,39783,5899,361,32118,4919,2428,89646,11,653,68226,13399,519,8065,1948,11,1880,6316,23878,13109,3869,342,52424,326,6,28400,307,13109,4046,4791,5392,5048,13,27058,1089,7889,326,6,18168,409,11083,58673,2249,11,1647,46494,274,6,27153,361,7010,514,60697,409,88817,8696,5293,5983,13,7695,18916,332,81186,951,100130,13,1708,1105,5019,1913,404,11,10362,1082,1765,514,88026,2933,11,4864,42775,273,1180,77776,3869,52895,716,653,4382,1296,409,44453,1291,7930,29557,2221,409,7591,23827,261,934,2053,86374,4298,2249,1880,665,74940,10484,13109,23761,42587,5512,5019,40192,404,27750,24601,13,5034,88026,1589,361,1880,3625,16178,417,348,19395,978,2629,645,15132,951,86374,4298,2249,42587,5512,41199,1208,85434,951,27138,13,34447,3625,14240,664,1291,17317,68061,625,306,6316,14896,13,5034,21797,13109,1826,653,54829,704,321,5019,19477,52750,326,6,5389,404,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,791,36815,8111,311,387,264,31678,477,15864,389,279,8712,315,22556,4857,7384,11,11951,21760,389,279,1005,315,9578,323,42063,304,6968,459,10728,29487,1672,10733,369,14016,627,198,791,19114,12302,555,11821,872,1866,11704,3318,449,1521,7384,11,27401,430,814,8493,4376,315,872,2919,42200,323,30090,2678,10688,320,7005,275,281,64272,5512,8,311,3619,279,6012,315,2204,9578,62644,13,2435,11415,279,7720,315,1701
