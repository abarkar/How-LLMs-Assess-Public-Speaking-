It appears to be a lecture or presentation on the topic of climate change and its impact on biodiversity, specifically focusing on the relationship between temperature and animal size.\n\nThe speaker starts by discussing the \"rule of Bergman,\" which states that larger animals tend to better preserve heat than smaller ones. This is illustrated with examples of polar bears and red-breasted birds in different climates. The speaker then delves into the physiological and biological factors at play, explaining how larger animals may have an advantage in colder environments.\n\nThe presentation also touches on the concept of \"thermal inertia\" and how some species adapt to changing temperatures by shifting their activity periods or migrating to new habitats. However, the speaker highlights that these adaptations can be limited, as some organisms are bound to their habitats or have genetic constraints that make it difficult for them to change.\n\nThe transcript concludes with a discussion on the importance of understanding the relationship between climate and animal size in the context of biodiversity and conservation efforts. The speaker emphasizes that this knowledge is crucial for predicting how species may respond to changing environmental conditions and developing effective strategies for preserving biodiversity in the face of climate change.\n\nSome interesting points made by the speaker include:\n\n1. Larger animals tend to better preserve heat than smaller ones, which can have significant implications for their survival.\n2. Climate change can lead to changes in animal size, as species adapt to new temperature regimes.\n3. Biodiversity responds to climate change by shifting its spatial distribution (e.g., migration) and temporal patterns (e.g., changing activity periods).\n4. Understanding the relationship between climate and animal size is essential for predicting how species will respond to environmental changes and developing effective conservation strategies.\n\nOverall, this transcript provides a thought-provoking exploration of the complex relationships between climate, animal size, and biodiversity.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,1252,9880,11,389,264,84228,64591,1744,39015,39723,3900,20272,70412,11,653,10065,39015,1481,300,1826,71151,40970,25500,13,9424,688,46206,3625,297,1082,12249,6033,35597,46206,3625,36041,333,31539,13,393,1466,2439,1370,51173,653,11604,1499,12267,13,47643,2005,63484,1826,5636,25500,1744,4538,36271,665,8560,2852,648,13,64105,64,272,17771,653,51173,11741,23034,11,10071,39043,15572,68,28463,49733,11,665,56747,12279,6809,11,3869,12366,11,39723,3900,20272,653,28800,9165,4558,451,13,7695,35737,40970,25500,1744,4538,259,546,263,8065,83259,409,1208,17360,4558,451,13,24703,308,17771,6502,6316,3190,24812,409,27389,7611,45973,3625,924,5192,4804,11,272,17771,1208,83229,3491,409,31782,1543,13,2998,6160,540,978,3257,648,11,3900,22011,1744,3625,94527,22641,306,64972,1208,523,61047,1744,3625,86696,13,4418,66,274,35329,20272,70412,1744,9964,1560,21965,25500,11,9964,10025,14295,6316,17508,700,74696,13,622,41901,16796,20272,326,6,4683,65679,11,9165,729,11,6502,5636,62197,934,39982,1291,13,11583,259,13559,409,53050,2098,1607,275,5636,83457,1744,1208,30203,295,20712,13,4418,66,951,4046,19926,30945,8467,13,445,6496,4864,9189,1370,273,409,64441,11,10071,3900,29253,28463,951,2144,38647,6160,1640,8467,13,46706,514,30281,11,42676,326,6,2530,3460,11,3900,20272,653,282,1607,19266,85,12339,13,7695,308,59858,264,5636,55455,3869,296,4091,11,39587,9964,757,1759,665,305,1553,13,34447,4502,9964,1560,5636,6800,11,9964,439,5636,409,31807,13583,13,5250,332,85815,1744,39015,9964,1765,2749,11,8941,34922,1826,6316,712,25108,668,409,78548,13,1611,326,31769,447,11067,5553,3625,281,9769,645,11,4502,503,34155,14707,13550,285,11,272,17771,514,11323,266,7930,6155,57332,13,19421,274,35329,20272,282,1607,11,9964,6800,285,13,34447,87320,949,23126,729,11,272,17771,1377,57332,11,4864,9189,1370,273,409,39043,75804,88253,13,14465,91507,9189,89504,409,11323,266,11,10071,76776,409,2798,14081,1598,13,41621,3665,89,25692,85815,1744,514,11323,266,2349,1880,1744,3625,27138,15132,294,1759,13,9605,20272,1208,56594,1986,13109,3663,8065,2609,1133,11323,266,2428,949,61651,14707,11,39043,7591,3825,951,16948,4558,1634,11,1370,86633,272,17771,13859,266,2428,13,39783,3488,5019,23589,265,11,4068,46524,3930,282,1607,949,4418,66,11,30870,713,2439,5553,514,31837,13,2009,48734,11,39043,35737,40970,70412,39015,1481,300,13,19421,272,17771,1208,55133,951,9517,23475,11,62439,409,2035,13,5034,56594,1986,13109,75871,665,2349,519,7010,326,77025,1330,13,34447,4068,4864,66517,4502,4864,841,94297,6502,30870,1414,949,29749,308,6,300,934,81991,7591,64184,9637,84411,536,294,6,9035,13109,13,5034,296,2227,51111,11,1370,51173,11,20272,15907,60404,5636,259,35657,13,2009,92942,523,13559,5636,62197,7010,1208,85434,5019,523,3376,951,15975,2469,13,19421,272,17771,1208,26633,90272,951,9517,23475,8065,9517,6583,1386,1133,13,5034,56594,1986,13109,75871,665,2349,519,7010,514,27138,13,14465,5320,2249,14707,11,22011,514,85059,2427,6809,11,10071,3900,379,264,653,490,1791,7930,757,342,5615,818,13,11583,84411,536,294,6,9035,13109,1826,29059,8047,7010,11083,342,4558,4978,13,2998,5636,11,7643,47276,11,1647,39646,1826,49733,13,64105,64,841,87264,6502,5636,4382,4502,503,31769,2629,285,70374,5636,46110,13,19421,272,17771,1208,8348,13532,25253,951,9517,23475,8065,2609,1133,11323,266,2428,13,5034,56594,1986,13109,75871,7010,3625,20934,598,4046,39624,10515,8467,13,19421,272,17771,3846,1765,75249,2700,306,11083,58673,2249,409,38317,13,1952,829,275,74699,1744,514,11323,266,1880,1208,62827,15132,409,296,4558,1557,13,34447,4502,514,11323,266,2349,7010,514,27138,11,3625,4039,12249,82133,12,8839,62439,409,62827,5019,3154,519,949,27058,514,47929,11,4864,91507,75144,653,51173,13,1952,69152,653,51655,409,46681,38883,11,951,98733,17724,7930,11083,77065,951,297,1082,12249,7010,43905,1208,9822,13,11246,92759,519,11,27750,77617,3946,409,86696,1880,409,94527,13,34447,5019,1208,56594,1986,13109,11,834,1474,6870,11,665,75249,272,17771,3062,949,61651,14707,11,665,27750,27138,409,25626,23851,11323,266,2428,11,1208,62827,11412,62439,26725,3625,20934,598,4046,39624,10515,8467,13,46408,7958,68,1208,7550,648,951,16948,4558,1634,1765,10335,265,13,64105,64,25692,27584,62439,9637,2035,7010,1208,13826,25108,818,38450,12267,13,5034,24408,33537,8047,3869,1208,62827,27750,36852,4918,27138,11,27549,20605,68,13,19421,272,3433,10333,31307,6033,6502,11,1208,62827,11,39043,42463,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,32,27387,36815,0,1102,8111,311,387,264,31678,477,15864,389,279,8712,315,10182,2349,323,1202,5536,389,73119,11,11951,21760,389,279,5133,1990,9499,323,10065,1404,627,198,791,19114,8638,555,25394,279,330,13233,315,31782,1543,1359,902,5415,430,8294,10099,8541,311,2731,21813,8798,1109,9333,6305,13,1115,374,36762,449,10507,315,25685,30824,323,2579,93008,15386,20229,304,2204,92399,13,578,19114,1243,1624,2396,1139,279,53194,323,24156,9547,520,1514,11,26073,1268,8294,10099,1253,617,459,9610,304,76214,22484,627,198,791,15864,1101,29727,
