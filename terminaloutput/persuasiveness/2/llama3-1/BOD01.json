Just as our bones provide structural support to our body, rebar in concrete provides support to the structure.\n\nHowever, just as diseases can affect our bones, corrosion can occur in concrete structures. The speaker's research focuses on developing mathematical models to predict and anticipate the risk of corrosion in these structures. These models are designed to be simple to use, cost-effective, and accurate.\n\nThe speaker is specifically interested in predicting the initiation phase of corrosion, which depends on environmental factors (e.g., temperature, humidity, and agent concentrations) as well as the concrete's ability to retard the corrosion process. This ability is reflected in performance indicators such as CO2 diffusion coefficients and chloride ion migration coefficients.\n\nThe goal of the research is to help engineers optimize and maximize the service life of concrete structures by taking into account not only the initiation phase but also the propagation phase of corrosion. This includes considering the effects of small cracks (up to 0.1 mm) on the structure's mechanical performance before it becomes a major concern.\n\nThe speaker hopes that their research will help ensure that modern bridges built with today's techniques will last for many years, if not decades or centuries, to come.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,20680,74466,45325,1744,27584,3625,37194,82,665,90551,783,6916,978,56311,10390,655,8811,3536,949,9648,55755,22011,11,74940,1826,1208,44178,16271,9465,653,37194,665,90551,783,6916,978,1880,514,34922,2854,467,949,356,17771,4046,1325,306,11,3869,326,55624,57663,3930,34922,2854,467,11,3900,379,264,6316,6070,2709,325,817,11,514,32232,10010,13,350,438,285,1744,7010,514,90551,783,6916,978,11,3900,379,264,6316,31159,1598,665,1645,1291,13,38891,89,6316,8811,329,648,2709,325,817,259,6853,934,80720,45441,13,46706,3846,4865,11,3625,2709,15132,8508,121038,5512,1880,841,82133,6502,69241,404,28130,436,57332,13,4366,1615,978,17187,11,514,34922,1826,3611,64,69713,13,46706,514,90551,783,6916,978,11,20662,8811,329,648,2709,325,817,1826,1208,56488,13,5034,56488,951,6916,2859,665,1645,1291,1826,4245,3869,326,6,1617,20234,1370,26633,13307,945,676,22589,13,2009,65570,4223,451,409,1841,20337,7930,1826,671,2159,519,7010,326,6,266,8801,764,12339,1880,3625,65125,37833,1439,7930,15132,30179,812,7010,326,93847,409,4809,1880,3625,297,3172,417,3869,90215,13,62463,13307,945,676,22589,16006,306,409,281,32453,95920,7010,514,90551,783,55398,81991,93381,71933,326,6,2227,1598,294,6,54553,13,39783,37291,1208,56488,45265,66,8047,11,1208,29465,4618,513,57128,11,27549,513,64592,69,273,1880,20272,4046,566,977,514,90551,783,13,46408,1589,8047,951,95159,22166,75419,1765,514,37194,13,14465,9189,93569,6669,10670,3625,1615,978,45045,13,3206,42775,6824,68,3869,52895,716,951,704,8839,5019,91878,3625,6892,10610,46138,3869,550,15433,556,1880,16961,261,514,10025,593,409,56488,7010,3625,6033,19456,1154,665,90551,783,6916,978,13,62463,704,8839,15132,951,1491,85798,7033,978,8637,8467,934,54386,917,6853,951,1491,85798,6892,10610,46138,13,1952,3625,917,6853,44351,66021,934,85217,15132,10737,5512,10253,27389,24719,811,2167,288,951,67965,2053,409,426,4334,13,5034,4040,13109,409,27750,1491,85798,1826,294,93825,3869,1208,37291,4382,294,100017,11,28800,1080,60768,519,665,4751,288,409,27138,409,5935,1880,51625,285,13,34447,272,17771,74699,39723,3625,79165,513,4684,5118,306,13,14465,296,55624,978,22550,7010,653,21134,27138,3869,550,15433,556,1208,10474,294,6,2381,7246,409,1208,56488,13,62408,10474,8024,3869,1208,10878,8047,1744,3625,13307,945,676,22589,2322,73468,5019,2961,1553,8065,53052,409,326,6,2227,1598,13,62408,10878,8047,7591,3825,2536,71686,951,4787,294,58736,3571,11,2798,14081,1598,11,2854,3748,978,8844,1880,20545,951,13307,945,676,22589,7010,326,41901,2842,40280,11,10071,44767,409,1208,23878,13109,3930,90551,783,3869,77072,261,28130,281,32453,376,367,13,62408,23878,13109,1826,4790,9486,1370,951,13519,1759,409,5178,13,2009,36706,409,7591,13311,409,7432,17,1880,514,36706,294,6,17060,5141,951,65125,37833,554,2249,13,4366,51173,11,5019,653,90551,783,3869,81098,2798,14081,1598,11,1208,10878,8047,409,5178,1826,409,220,1041,8261,13,5034,38682,1001,367,1180,31037,23289,1744,1208,10878,8047,409,2532,294,22827,6033,19456,425,1826,93381,46429,6316,37291,1208,56488,45265,66,8047,13,15089,20272,514,1370,543,51453,11,326,6,28400,467,1826,77554,68862,10237,6316,37291,8811,1037,13,24703,7930,308,17771,6502,83195,11,665,89175,13,5034,4040,13109,409,11083,58673,2249,409,38317,1826,294,55624,978,911,261,1208,10474,409,54743,409,56488,7010,1208,17536,409,326,6,283,19456,425,13,62408,10878,8047,1826,39674,14081,8047,5019,6316,6033,65930,409,282,434,554,409,220,15,11,16,9653,13,39783,38920,54877,68636,13,362,3846,357,1037,2922,6496,11,3625,24601,32118,4919,8467,3930,37194,841,15132,6502,5916,14014,13,2009,10025,593,409,326,6,6581,2159,55755,409,326,6,283,19456,425,3567,1188,296,11305,324,71686,42676,1208,56488,93381,396,951,357,3536,1860,1149,5512,13,41621,326,6,52659,14707,13550,285,13,5034,1620,13109,409,11083,58673,2249,409,38317,1826,294,26248,1814,1880,409,1709,1814,3625,6892,10610,46138,409,76407,3869,7706,12329,1880,31127,12329,1208,10878,8047,409,2532,951,6033,19456,1154,665,90551,783,6916,978,13,62408,10878,8047,87885,13559,71151,326,6,25632,14081,685,409,17536,3930,4382,52571,324,1744,17317,74533,13,19421,272,76832,1589,8047,6316,33086,13,34447,44767,653,1560,5481,404,5019,1744,3625,37194,82,294,6,2933,69572,88253,19477,12059,9952,3625,12823,294,6,2933,69572,88253,9165,89810,514,9880,13,2009,9880,841,35737,5636,39015,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,32,27387,36815,4999,198,8586,596,264,12399,315,1148,358,3077,16365,505,279,1495,512,198,791,19114,11,459,24490,11,374,25394,279,43874,1990,14509,14726,320,68,13,70,2637,40073,8,323,3823,13162,13,4702,439,1057,25896,3493,24693,1862,311,1057,2547,11,312,2308,304,14509,5825,1862,311,279,6070,627,198,11458,11,1120,439,19338,649,7958,1057,25896,11,56488,649,12446,304,14509,14726,13,578,19114,596,3495,24400,389,11469,37072,4211,311,7168,323,48248,279,5326,315,56488,304,1521,14726,13,4314,4211,527,6319,311,387,4382,311,1005,11,2853,53421,11,323,13687,627,198,791,19114,374,11951,8173,304,52997,279,61568,10474,315,56488,11,9
