This friend is made of wood and has developed over time.\n\n**Characteristics of Wood**: The speaker describes how wood can be found in various forms, such as flooring, furniture, or even in walls and upholstered furniture. He notes that wood seems simple but is actually quite rich in terms of its composition (cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin).\n\n**Wood's Problem**: Messie Bois has a fear of fire, especially when it's already been transformed into a specific shape, like furniture. His friend asked for help to overcome this phobia.\n\n**Solving the Problem**: The speaker researched solutions and came up with an innovative idea: creating a natural resin coating that would protect wood from fires by swelling when exposed to heat. This \"rev√™tement anti-tout\" (anti-all) would not only protect wood but also help extinguish fires.\n\n**Environmental Concerns**: The speaker notes that existing coatings have toxic chemicals and are not environmentally friendly, which led him to use natural and renewable components, like lignin, a byproduct of the paper industry. This approach promotes circular economy principles, where waste materials (like wood residues) are reused to protect wood.\n\n**Conclusion**: While the story is not yet complete, the speaker believes that using natural resources to solve problems can lead to positive outcomes for his friend and the environment.\n\nOverall, this text showcases a creative and eco-friendly approach to solving a problem related to wood, highlighting the importance of sustainable practices.
