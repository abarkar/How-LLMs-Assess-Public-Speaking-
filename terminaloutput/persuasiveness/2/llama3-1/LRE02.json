No, I'm fascinated by them, we're all fascinated. But these volcanoes aren't immortal. They eventually die too, not from a heart attack, but rather from exhaustion of their magmatic pump. As a structural geologist, my thesis aims to determine the anatomy of a dead and decomposing volcano. This volcano is the Snow Piton, which has been extinct for over 20,000 years and has been weathered by the elements. Now that its flanks are eroded by cirques, river-carved cliffs, and rare geological events, I'm diving into the innards of this giant like a doctor with a stethoscope, examining the rocks of the Snow Piton. Sometimes I observe fractures, testaments to great catastrophes that shake up my patient's diagnosis and complicate my diagnostic work. My research involves first walking kilometers of trails to create a geological map of the rocks and fractures present in my patient. This is what we call geological mapping. I also conduct complementary exams to determine the composition of the rocks I've carefully selected, as well as their age through microscopic observations and sophisticated chemical analyses. All these indices allow me to reconstruct a million-year history of this old Snow Piton, its constructions, and its destructions. But let's get back to fractures, because fractures are my specialty. Fractures are zones of weakness that weaken volcanoes. It's actually they that cause landslides and rockfalls. So it's important to know if these fractures have properly healed, been well-sealed. In fact, no, because I'm a structural geologist. And who says 'structuralist' says 'structure' says 'fracture'. And so non-healed fractures are exactly what interests me. I'm not a doctor, so I don't aim to treat them, but rather to find out if there's treasure hidden within. But what could this treasure be on an extinct volcano called the Snow Piton? Clearly, it's heat, or rather warm water - geothermal power. But how can we know if this warm water is actually hiding within? That's the whole challenge of the second part of my thesis. I'll perform a sonar scan along the way. By passing an electric probe into the ground, I want to see if hot fluids or digested thermos are hidden beneath. In other words, I'm trying to find out if the fractures in the Snow Piton aren't actually a vast network of canals filled with warm water, through which it would be possible to drill and bring this warm water to the surface to produce electricity. You've understood, ladies and gentlemen, that I won't invent warm water, but I have three years to try to find it.\"","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,11876,4499,66,598,15132,951,20183,45632,409,82711,13,11842,11,757,15550,86396,11,17317,15550,86396,13,34447,27750,4499,66,598,841,15132,6502,4998,371,2053,13,81245,1913,79738,84440,28463,1370,67683,404,13,11842,6502,294,22827,2961,49530,3786,689,593,11,10071,96308,294,22827,4043,283,544,1001,409,28130,272,89412,11,1208,30584,375,4983,8637,2428,13,6178,72,11,4864,36731,74672,77828,24693,17194,11,1880,514,719,409,7643,270,4558,325,1826,409,7591,23827,261,326,62595,22612,648,294,22827,36373,10237,1880,665,45369,409,7591,77907,13,24703,36373,11,272,17771,514,20428,263,951,841,52763,11,1880,45602,20272,5636,409,220,508,220,931,8261,934,35329,274,17771,4046,668,396,1880,1207,275,409,84871,57625,295,3625,528,3342,978,4108,13,43987,26178,1744,15907,1344,1149,82,15132,1922,355,5512,1370,3625,30570,14295,11,3625,26564,22626,1218,64,484,14014,1370,3625,436,33920,31539,11,1880,1744,3625,50510,15081,409,51655,513,3381,436,5518,11,41091,11,38920,10237,6853,11,296,6,833,283,544,265,7010,3625,11751,87455,409,3846,74672,519,13,8290,68,2933,1880,326,13649,665,1925,11,19227,653,32118,8332,258,9952,4538,357,978,339,63753,11,503,6,12119,93113,68,3625,938,8696,3930,20428,263,951,841,52763,13,7695,296,6,1138,535,294,6,31830,951,78332,11,47289,6489,625,1154,409,38546,35205,22761,288,7930,523,3042,11206,306,326,6,23156,409,1647,8893,1880,4684,5118,306,1647,15439,13,36684,58673,2249,13263,7010,653,21134,27138,3869,45740,414,404,951,15395,316,75104,409,3288,4918,54401,294,31769,74199,404,6316,48454,951,938,8696,1880,951,78332,30179,21938,46206,1647,8893,13,356,17771,3846,934,54386,917,6853,1208,7558,3257,648,74672,1640,2428,13,622,6,27153,361,44767,951,7151,729,4684,42625,17724,54401,409,7591,23827,261,1208,18528,951,938,8696,1744,503,34155,779,19388,43765,71132,77,14014,11,10071,28463,28130,29005,713,11,77433,3869,951,24654,8065,73757,1880,951,29060,38094,8467,19219,380,5118,14014,13,350,788,27750,15285,757,29557,73468,44351,409,312,1040,275,8977,6316,3610,294,6,1036,14014,294,6,90446,409,3846,92622,20428,263,951,841,52763,11,15907,96939,1880,15907,19814,82,13,34447,19443,2439,10253,78332,11,66021,1744,3625,78332,11,272,17771,7643,76305,13109,13,11876,78332,15132,951,26467,409,2267,21041,325,11,8508,121038,519,3625,4499,66,598,13,356,17771,294,6,52009,1759,84568,7930,15132,3869,326,6,4775,483,951,4046,65,11206,285,1880,951,2840,15760,1392,409,25911,13,7695,1826,39587,3062,409,47929,4502,27750,78332,513,15132,14707,9517,1768,14014,11,14707,1400,8637,14014,13,2998,20272,11,2536,1120,1133,11,66021,1744,4864,36731,74672,77828,24693,17194,13,19421,7930,22011,24693,17194,22011,6070,22011,59904,13,19421,39587,3625,78332,6502,14707,9517,1768,14014,11,272,17771,1120,1133,3846,7930,296,55624,978,22550,13,14465,841,36731,39587,6502,32118,8332,258,11,39587,4864,841,52571,6502,3869,3625,779,78756,11,10071,3869,47929,4502,653,490,5512,269,274,59858,6636,13,34447,26077,25692,14707,23761,3846,490,5512,269,1765,653,36373,4046,668,396,76190,978,514,20428,263,951,841,52763,949,5034,523,61047,11,4046,1325,336,479,13,356,17771,96308,326,93847,13826,799,11,3869,83195,13510,13,5034,74672,1605,74696,409,4538,46110,9859,13,34447,20662,384,2933,13826,799,11,4068,47929,4502,27549,274,59858,6636,9517,301,1001,949,356,17771,39015,16968,326,41901,3841,84,409,1208,26633,90272,48901,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,14465,91507,2515,8977,6316,4046,331,3257,648,514,1317,409,20662,270,4558,325,13,2998,66517,519,45347,653,37194,98151,34395,7010,514,2092,11,5019,47929,4502,951,15962,288,70412,82,6033,4170,5512,8065,30945,437,274,59858,61387,306,13,2998,294,81979,4751,288,11,503,6,26577,648,409,47929,4502,3625,78332,3930,20428,263,951,841,52763,841,75164,6502,11,665,59157,13109,11,653,348,5642,98947,409,649,35965,811,69241,285,294,93847,13826,799,11,8065,19910,3930,43014,3900,87264,3284,294,6,27153,8977,653,369,425,11,5019,20028,1323,263,466,20662,384,2933,13826,799,665,7479,11,5019,2558,556,409,326,31769,47262,13109,13,41621,326,26248,554,89,13550,285,11,11083,67,986,1880,9622,46138,11,4864,841,91507,78705,55755,6502,17459,261,326,93847,13826,799,11,10071,503,34155,56321,8261,5019,4043,1155,409,1208,46524,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,32,27387,1495,4999,198,8586,596,264,11413,14807,1473,1,37461,4919,7217,527,20566,315,4027,13,2360,11,358,2846,61914,555,1124,11,584,2351,682,61914,13,2030,1521,36373,7217,7784,956,60214,13,2435,9778,2815,2288,11,539,505,264,4851,3440,11,719,4856,505,70663,315,872,4983,38344,14155,13,1666,264,24693,3980,16549,11,856,17850,22262,311,8417,279,62690,315,264,5710,323,29602,8478,66306,13,1115,66306,374,279,19435,40079,263,11,902,706,1027,69918,369,927,220,508,11,931,1667,323,706,1027,9282,291,555,279,5540,13,4800,430,1202,1344,4129,527,2781,6879,555,30570,14295,11,15140,24948,2111,86949,11,323,9024,86278,4455,11,358,2846,43515,1139,279,6301,2402,315,420,14880,1093,264,10896,449,264,357,774,63753,11,38936,279,23902,315,279,19435,40079,263
