I'm a chemist, and naturally, as such, I'll be able to create a bomb, synthesize drugs, but above all, I'll be able to tell you what's really in your champagne bottles. And all that at the same time. But good, we know that reality is a bit more complex. And for my part, I do bio-inspired chemistry. Specifically, what do I do? I copy biological systems, enzymes, and I simply steal the essential structure and functionality of these complex systems, and to develop chemical models in my laboratory capable of performing the same reactions. These are catalysts. It's important to know that in the body, enzymes are responsible for a wide range of vital chemical reactions for your organism. Yes, absolutely vital. The transport of oxygen, the functioning of oxygen, your metabolism or your neurons, which must already be well exercised for the evening, I think. And this is just a few examples of their numerous roles. And in the same way, their chemical copies, catalysts, have become absolute indispensable tools. The problem is that until now, they were almost exclusively developed from precious metals. Let's take a concrete example. Your car catalytic converters contain, for instance, platinum, which will speak more to you later. And one can say that these metals really deserved their nickname as precious metals. During this morning's stock market, the eurodium was no less than 80,000 euros per kilo. That's not bad. And platinum, much more accessible, barely 20,000 euros. You see, there is a problem. But nature has always made its reactions with enzymes and what they had at hand. Abundant metals like nickel, copper, iron... To give you an analogy, iron is exactly 67 cents per kilo. Not even a pastry shop. You understand the interest now of developing new catalyst systems capable of effectively integrating these abundant metals. The challenge is to control these new complex systems. And that's the whole point of my thesis. Imagine it as if I was the bad student in class who tried to copy from his neighbor, copying from biology itself, to get a good grade. But the problem is that biology writes super, super, super badly. It has been studied for decades and there are still debates about its real functioning. I must be able to control my catalysts perfectly to always improve them and hope one day to see them rival or even surpass the old expensive models. But if my thesis has taught me something, I think it's important to be able to take a step back and look at what's happening in the little box next
