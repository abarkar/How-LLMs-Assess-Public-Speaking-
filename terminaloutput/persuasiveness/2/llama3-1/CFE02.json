The speaker argues that instead of burning it as fuel, we should find ways to reuse it in innovative materials.\n\nHere's a rough translation:\n\n\"I love trash. You might think it's strange at the same time. Given the enormous amount of waste we accumulate on this planet, it's better to love it than hate it. So, if we take care of our trash... To produce paper, you use wood. It's well known that we extract cellulose from wood, but in the process, we also generate 100 million tons per year of my favorite waste product, lignin, which is the second most abundant component of wood. We don't know what to do with it. So, we burn it to produce energy, which is a fun destination. Well, I ardently wish to save the lignin from the flames. I'm desperately trying to valorize this waste product. In the laboratory where I work, I've already started giving beauty treatments to the lignin. I give it proteins to reactivate its molecular structure at the atomic level of oxygen atoms. It regains weight and takes on new forms. Yes, its molecular mass increases. But it still has a psychological wound from being forcibly separated from cellulose. To support it, I present another mystery waste product, corn stover, that handsome devil from around the corner. But if you see this vegetable crop lying in the plain of Lima for their meeting, I reduce Mr. to powder. If this happens with plants, believe me, waste more waste equals match. Our two protagonists are so professional that they eventually give birth to a new composite material, a kind of biodegradable lightweight plastic, which is a beautiful baby. With a precision micrometric scanner, I observe it in minute details, I manipulate it, analyze it, and test its mechanical resistance. So maybe tomorrow we can find this material in our kitchen furniture, car interior, phone casing, through my work and valorizing waste like lignin. I'm bringing a durable solution to replacing plastic materials derived from oil. Ah yes, you see with a romanticism also. We can move the world forward. And so, they're so professional that they give birth to a new composite material using a precision micrometric scanner. I observe the vibrations of their chemical bond. Repeat the story... and voil√†! Oh wait, I forgot one sentence, sorry.\"","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,622,26248,547,3625,7591,331,1441,13,41621,26483,19610,39043,33288,665,27584,27138,13,57702,1208,10484,13109,282,640,483,817,409,7591,331,1441,934,54386,15783,1130,1765,20662,3197,66522,11,64972,348,2784,3625,264,3212,1744,3625,7591,74458,13,1708,1105,4502,389,864,77,1339,779,258,409,12155,7591,331,1441,13,350,21198,1131,27058,2558,556,3930,26365,1291,389,69152,3930,66304,13,356,17771,14707,4635,84,15890,389,11741,1339,1208,70002,974,11,10071,389,78422,12339,28463,8065,21765,11,220,1041,220,931,220,931,409,52021,1370,459,409,1647,7591,40213,27389,69,68862,11,1208,72700,483,26633,90272,9129,28674,3682,60224,3930,66304,13,1952,841,829,275,6502,75249,20028,13,1708,1105,389,1208,1437,30872,273,5019,2558,556,409,326,31769,64374,2523,18223,52087,13,61651,14707,11,41091,11,4864,46838,556,802,28531,479,33254,424,1208,72700,483,951,1344,8836,288,13,14465,52571,1080,30872,668,1744,1080,30872,668,3869,14448,12329,3846,7591,40213,13,46706,514,9511,67763,39723,4864,42775,273,11,4864,56445,46939,1370,2098,12267,6316,5017,978,3869,1208,72700,483,13,14465,25400,21559,951,1760,978,1572,5019,1208,9517,533,1553,8065,53052,409,27750,19670,288,294,6,61263,70,48099,13,46408,312,59976,3930,97418,951,1376,288,13,507,2005,11,829,58617,22337,978,3395,12267,19861,12826,13,9240,68,829,16458,554,8841,1640,2428,11,65285,266,409,829,19266,36235,52842,8047,9952,1208,70002,974,13,27058,1208,65827,268,404,11,4864,25400,30179,6960,653,47838,7591,40213,11679,12339,11,436,2642,273,409,7643,38672,82,11,514,72006,342,437,325,3930,16652,13,34447,4502,9189,23933,10333,3846,348,19395,10515,278,934,54386,25692,46131,9781,25108,1215,7010,1208,628,8511,409,1208,63053,5019,28130,10607,11,4864,9517,1072,285,1647,82,62005,665,281,3023,265,13,12095,39043,513,39904,22299,39043,46206,3625,348,19395,978,2629,2249,11,272,3433,10333,41091,11,7591,331,1441,5636,7591,331,1441,11,39043,2489,13,51097,26633,46684,288,15132,19227,1001,4913,36527,934,85217,1913,79738,1370,71751,4415,24918,3869,653,43453,5634,28154,2933,28814,11,6316,80444,409,88247,2428,5790,10676,978,56594,978,6902,4893,63828,1414,11,653,72006,90551,92174,13,62293,653,21438,409,51625,1854,19748,442,978,376,2428,4864,326,6,49133,7010,3625,4647,485,417,7591,41060,11,4864,514,490,9464,11,4864,326,6,44803,325,11,4864,75765,829,31807,4011,32118,4919,2428,13,362,32384,11,25692,85815,1744,2486,467,11,389,5019,969,38831,15170,3846,5634,28154,2933,7010,3625,757,392,645,409,12155,31547,1572,326,6,97802,8061,409,12155,4160,42204,11,1208,1080,593,409,12155,43116,17144,11,1370,1647,42775,1880,665,14448,285,519,951,7591,331,1441,22299,1208,72700,483,13,622,6,391,45808,39587,6316,6425,27220,8065,1323,16491,951,88247,8467,374,2425,355,3930,281,10515,5898,13,61651,97507,11,9189,23933,10333,9952,653,1437,258,409,68567,44618,28463,13,1952,25692,20028,1860,11967,514,38900,13,19421,39587,97507,11,46152,15132,19227,1001,4913,36527,1744,46152,33537,306,4415,24918,3869,653,43453,5634,28154,2933,28814,9952,653,21438,409,51625,1854,19748,442,978,376,2428,13,622,6,49133,3625,78352,409,28130,83199,38094,2428,13,51223,79,978,466,326,6,90446,13,19421,4160,321,6496,13,4418,66,497,503,34155,6033,2067,648,6316,17571,11,46838,337,8047,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5084,1093,499,617,264,36815,315,264,8982,477,15864,922,279,12939,315,1062,7623,323,34978,12571,11,8104,72700,258,11,902,374,264,555,3107,315,5684,5788,13,578,19114,29633,430,4619,315,20252,433,439,10633,11,584,1288,1505,5627,311,27068,433,304,18699,7384,627,198,8586,596,264,11413,14807,1473,7189,3021,23701,13,1472,2643,1781,433,596,15234,520,279,1890,892,13,16644,279,23205,3392,315,12571,584,47376,389,420,11841,11,433,596,2731,311,3021,433,1109,12491,433,13,2100,11,422,584,1935,2512,315,1057,23701,1131,2057,8356,5684,11,499,1005,7732,13,1102,596,1664,3967,430,584,8819,70002,974,505,7732,11,719,304,279,1920,11,584,1101,7068,220,1041,3610,20181,824,1060,315,856,7075,12571,2027,11,72700,258,11,902,374,279,2132,1455,44611,3777,315,7732,13,1226,1541,956,1440,1148,311,656,449,433,13,2100,11,584,8395,433,311,8356,4907,11,902,374,264,2523,9284,13,8489,11,358,85009,4501,6562,311,3665,279,72700,258,505,279,39885,13,358,2846,38643,4560,311,14448,553,420,12571,2027,13,763,279,27692,1405,358,990,11,358,3077,2736,3940,7231,13444,22972,311,279,72700,258,13,358,3041,433,28896,311,14085,736,1202,31206,6070,520,279,25524,2237,315,24463,33299,13,1102,1239,1771,4785,323,5097,389,502,7739,13,7566,11,1202,31206,3148,12992,13,2030,433,2103,706,264,24064,27653,505,1694,74923,19180,505,70002,974,13,2057,1862,433,11,358,3118,2500,23347,12571,2027,11,14095,357,2017,11,430,44877,38736,505,2212,279,9309,13,2030,422,499,1518,420,36581,19641,21078,304,279,14733,315,63053,369,872,6574,11,358,8108,4491,13,311,17138,13,1442,420,8741,449,11012,11,4510,757,11,12571,810,12571,17239,2489,13,5751,1403,95735,527,779,6721,430,814,9778,3041,7342,311,264,502,28814,3769,11,264,3169,315,6160,536,781
