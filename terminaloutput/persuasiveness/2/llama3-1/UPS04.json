The speaker starts by sharing their personal experience with their father, a mechanic, and how they are fascinated by the idea of self-driving cars.\n\nThe speaker notes that today, some of their father's knowledge has been automated, and cars can already diagnose themselves. They also mention that in the near future, cars may become completely autonomous, where humans only need to provide a destination.\n\nHowever, the speaker emphasizes the importance of cybersecurity for these vehicles. They explain that just like our phones, cars are connected objects that can be attacked or infected by viruses. This could have serious consequences, not just for individual owners but also for others who may be affected by the car's actions.\n\nThe speaker then introduces their thesis: how to make a car learn and self-defend? They explain that a car has several components, including computers, electronics, and sensors that allow it to perceive its environment, analyze data, and make decisions. Their work involves developing algorithms and mathematical models to build an artificial intelligence that simulates the immune system of an autonomous vehicle.\n\nThe speaker highlights two types of immune systems: innate, which reacts quickly but is limited in its ability to adapt to new threats; and acquired or adaptive, which can learn from experience to recognize and respond to new attacks. They aim to create an AI that is inspired by the second type, as it will be able to detect new attacks and viruses.\n\nThe speaker explains how their AI system works: it monitors all communications between different components of the car to try to learn a signature or fingerprint that identifies normal behavior. If an anomaly is detected, the AI system will trigger security systems to prevent any malicious activity from occurring.\n\nFinally, the speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of technology in protecting humans and making our lives safer. They note that their work aims to protect not just individual car owners but also others who may be affected by a vehicle's actions.\n\nThe transcript ends with the speaker thanking the audience for their attention.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,3206,281,12339,1826,32118,4919,3457,268,13,356,8458,296,26248,44093,15550,258,978,409,514,46131,665,26633,6033,56321,1437,4042,645,1323,7211,265,665,15572,68,3625,45165,83613,2482,13,362,9832,77492,88253,11,6316,48901,409,4538,47929,1826,5113,3689,8047,13,11876,4160,42204,274,49455,31559,8372,5118,306,13,1952,274,6,391,652,37093,27584,3869,3625,98054,4684,4558,79507,95103,288,13,69327,1208,86806,7754,1744,17317,44521,2439,3869,28130,71751,11,272,17771,29449,9284,13,7695,513,25692,934,54386,45441,1208,88818,46680,2214,39723,326,54386,274,1815,76069,556,13,2998,5589,11,5019,76076,11,3625,36852,4918,3869,2278,978,1126,653,14175,285,13,7695,47090,47929,934,31109,81645,11,272,17771,653,31260,4667,978,11,22299,29449,100007,13,4418,66,11,3900,25692,23761,272,1260,294,6,1617,20234,6033,409,17188,13,19421,4502,11,7010,29449,2317,68,409,9693,1941,978,2407,13109,75804,88253,11,3625,2909,1441,4667,5512,11,389,3625,60172,1765,17317,11,2486,467,11,272,17771,17317,7930,682,2439,23761,2700,5512,1370,27750,2909,1441,13,19421,3625,1651,64,14295,56311,17317,11148,556,1880,11148,556,3869,29449,1218,61140,13,14465,9189,436,395,554,11,272,17771,39015,39723,86953,1188,7643,270,4558,325,13,12535,20028,917,9484,265,3869,6316,81645,949,12535,274,6,3989,1773,121597,408,265,949,39783,81645,2278,4558,451,51854,2909,1441,13,31137,3357,324,11,4046,70329,2428,1880,28463,951,2107,668,1759,7930,82133,25400,29557,10367,409,9302,12329,11,8678,805,1880,59394,951,35881,6948,13,6178,72,11,1647,42775,6824,68,3869,48021,665,2035,951,12384,288,1880,951,1491,85798,7033,978,8637,8467,5019,19477,52750,6316,11478,1989,1104,72,6853,7930,11412,1675,8646,514,72601,4998,3928,12267,294,31109,81645,3154,263,638,13,1219,2727,29449,72601,4998,3928,12267,11,4538,436,57332,1826,409,20028,665,80444,1744,12155,2909,1441,841,513,7591,583,75,306,6502,13,19421,409,47371,408,265,4538,2942,44618,45973,43905,76220,294,52152,376,7713,8811,588,484,5048,13,46706,3625,42345,66474,4998,3928,17724,11,389,264,26633,4595,13,39783,294,635,6301,8047,11,7930,9517,74972,100198,11,10071,58271,409,20028,3663,3869,951,945,22550,1759,87325,13,19421,6316,294,635,19830,1082,6033,10737,1413,11,1841,27549,1826,13171,294,53149,9484,265,3869,74282,66014,64972,4538,61624,22530,13,6178,72,11,1647,11478,1989,1104,72,6853,11,27549,274,6,1354,23772,3930,26633,90272,955,13,3341,1647,528,14081,49530,1826,409,85877,440,261,409,80080,1651,64,14295,1880,409,87325,17188,13,27058,20028,3663,3869,326,6,613,1923,1133,409,12155,2909,1441,13,19421,409,47371,408,265,4538,2942,44618,45973,43905,76220,294,52152,376,7713,8811,588,484,5048,13,19421,409,47371,408,265,4538,2942,44618,45973,43905,76220,294,52152,376,7713,8811,588,484,5048,13,19421,409,47371,408,265,4538,2942,44618,45973,43905,76220,294,52152,376,7713,8811,588,484,5048,13,362,326,6,613,1923,1133,1880,3869,1208,34280,20053,13109,951,41467,13,19421,5019,3846,20028,11,326,55624,8677,1989,1104,72,6853,11,7930,1826,9517,22235,1370,11083,12384,288,11,15765,4618,40744,3625,17320,9465,3625,85114,40321,1821,409,1208,81645,13,27058,4043,1155,294,53149,9484,265,6316,12223,11,653,12541,294,6,37939,46429,11,7930,3608,57609,514,52962,1133,4725,3930,45165,83613,1130,13,19421,4502,3869,653,4545,11,326,57286,266,3930,72601,409,1208,81645,1826,98642,3869,1208,12223,11,39587,43905,35881,1854,7930,11412,23761,85424,1826,63828,13178,547,13,19421,7010,514,4865,32150,556,11,4502,326,57286,266,7591,64519,11,409,1208,12223,11,3900,379,40142,6316,70673,648,13,19421,39015,11,326,55624,8677,1989,1104,72,6853,11412,7591,566,268,9211,951,42345,66474,409,77463,13,27058,8654,5615,9211,43905,76220,294,52152,376,7713,13,5034,2869,38469,264,44093,1469,403,978,67009,1880,77463,3869,326,93825,2854,467,13,435,2852,519,665,80444,1744,326,55624,8677,1989,1104,72,6853,17317,1760,73899,409,1208,293,49530,1082,2854,8511,13,19421,4502,653,9880,11,1647,281,12339,1826,7010,6316,81645,3154,263,638,11,1880,829,2107,1295,11,3900,308,6,4202,1339,6502,3869,6033,63346,514,2107,354,13,25145,72,13,25145,72,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2028,374,264,36815,315,264,8982,477,15864,555,4423,889,374,25394,279,8712,315,39293,11731,323,62542,13,578,19114,8638,555,11821,872,4443,3217,449,872,7126,11,264,45239,11,323,1268,814,527,61914,555,279,4623,315,659,60811,9515,627,198,791,19114,8554,430,3432,11,1063,315,872,7126,596,6677,706,1027,28598,11,323,9515,649,2736,58681,5694,13,2435,1101,6420,430,304,279,3221,3938,11,9515,1253,3719,6724,39293,11,1405,12966,1193,1205,311,3493,264,9284,627,198,11458,11,279,19114,66159,279,12939,315,62542,369,1521,11731,13,2435,10552,430,1120,1093,1057,18084,11,9515,527,8599,6302,430,649,387,18855,477,29374,555,42068,13,1115,1436,617,6129,16296,11,539,1120,369,3927,7980,719,1101,369,3885,889,1253,387,11754,555,279,1841,596,6299,627,198,791,19114,1243,40019,872,17850,25,1268,311,1304,264,1841,4048,323,659,29899,408,30,2435,10552,430,264,1841,706,3892,6956,11,2737,
