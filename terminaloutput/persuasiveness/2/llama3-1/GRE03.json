The speaker discusses how society expects parents to be happy and fulfilled all the time, but in reality, being a parent can be exhausting and lead to burn-out. They mention that research shows that parents are more likely to experience burn-out than business executives.\n\nThe speaker goes on to describe their own work as a psychologist, which involves predicting and preventing parental burn-out through workshops and training programs. They explain how they use techniques such as stress management, mindfulness, and emotional regulation to help parents cope with the demands of parenthood.\n\nWhat's interesting is that the speaker mentions using hair samples (m√®ches de cheveux) to evaluate the effectiveness of their intervention program. Specifically, they measure the level of cortisol in the hair (taux de cortisol capillaire), which is a marker of chronic stress.\n\nThe transcript ends with the speaker mentioning how there's no one-size-fits-all solution for being a good parent, and that finding solutions is an ongoing process.\n\nOverall, this text appears to be a thought-provoking discussion on the challenges of parenting and the importance of prioritizing parental well-being.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,38891,89,653,11159,1370,543,51453,7010,514,43014,9189,26725,28490,89,294,22827,74817,12844,6223,978,11,294,22827,22641,3675,3930,34922,11,294,22827,18078,65746,11,294,22827,31547,258,1291,7930,27389,3462,5019,9189,26725,26317,628,1900,27389,69,14081,5512,1880,294,22827,9120,33571,22176,64,7930,17452,26317,22040,1441,3625,5636,282,788,1880,7930,513,27389,14310,86577,1744,9189,779,9188,89,44093,77818,2249,13,356,295,11159,11,76190,2439,31307,326,41901,69,685,13,19421,40744,27750,48577,64555,17724,11,76190,2439,12,645,6699,13,4241,9425,951,35881,2734,552,11,3625,8841,1640,1157,14848,84788,72,3869,17780,8977,1208,4294,87782,409,16968,514,8811,383,324,3930,38900,10253,6699,13,356,13059,519,11,25945,28800,409,76305,75460,274,55624,978,676,306,3869,4068,3625,6699,11,84440,11,18434,306,28130,46679,13109,13,46706,29449,7829,11,3900,379,264,6316,1651,6960,5019,1744,1208,46679,13109,45441,44093,13,39783,88411,6928,13,11876,60120,6699,312,20822,81541,951,503,337,552,7558,288,11,951,58482,6154,811,1880,84871,409,86696,78418,12249,296,625,2439,13,11876,60404,15132,16265,8839,11,39587,3625,6699,3567,969,1188,23761,3625,5636,77818,2249,3930,38900,13,356,8458,1826,83195,11,10071,6502,16968,514,27138,13,2998,59157,13109,11,23761,2748,11,39043,36709,13,64105,64,36709,3869,19227,1486,1744,409,5636,665,5636,409,33820,598,1880,409,26365,300,308,6,1138,81541,5636,3869,513,75802,88778,5512,13,81245,274,31769,652,285,306,13,5034,38317,20605,265,27584,934,85217,274,31769,652,285,306,5636,1744,3625,53542,294,82405,17724,13,41621,62299,6350,285,949,9424,688,11,3625,6699,84440,1474,5615,9004,841,11427,306,6502,934,85217,5945,544,8135,409,8395,9994,46679,13,11876,1615,978,45045,409,8395,9994,46679,15132,25945,19266,85,31539,13,12623,409,83977,1220,11,5636,409,4738,2436,11,5636,409,38605,6200,343,2436,1880,409,8811,30532,3095,13,350,519,5019,326,41901,61827,11,3625,21961,11,3625,2138,31355,1218,59307,13,3206,436,57332,665,37622,1744,8841,77828,6824,68,3869,550,15433,556,13,19421,3869,27389,43406,326,53149,9425,1133,951,6699,13,62293,11083,4631,4558,70,1157,11,17317,57038,390,79884,653,18629,409,27389,7611,7930,348,1082,3869,2579,263,1215,10253,6699,409,1208,274,14081,10610,13109,11,3930,60020,11,409,1208,24617,13,33150,45369,294,6,84426,4918,11,503,6,57379,3625,6699,3869,917,9484,265,951,12823,409,59471,3930,8631,11,409,7245,483,42563,11,409,59471,951,4046,76,41356,61907,3742,13,34447,4068,47929,1744,1647,21623,1826,31914,580,949,61651,14707,11,4864,57625,4618,7010,1208,83067,951,6699,13,41621,5019,7379,89,9189,13510,11,12769,11876,8841,1640,1157,11,39587,11,272,17771,4725,13,8345,34447,4864,1239,42441,28463,43153,3091,588,2249,13,27058,4046,838,8977,326,6,6581,292,582,13109,409,20662,21623,11,4864,28130,550,19010,79351,951,98385,296,4558,8696,409,3091,588,2249,33670,1880,3869,1208,1913,3930,18629,5019,93455,514,9637,2249,409,89942,2107,6374,556,11,75467,324,3930,8631,27076,2428,11,1880,10484,3125,326,58591,73511,7769,409,28130,14240,266,409,77323,1880,409,14707,85815,13,1952,308,53149,9484,6502,3869,326,31769,56745,3869,23761,653,7970,2748,13,24703,87264,951,14707,21965,1317,1157,14240,29246,11,25692,85815,27584,4225,258,552,13,356,17771,87320,7010,11083,58673,2249,11,503,6,434,61055,409,46524,951,10105,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5084,430,420,1495,374,264,36815,315,264,8982,477,31678,2728,555,264,54595,389,279,8712,315,49058,323,8395,9994,13,578,19114,35434,1268,8396,25283,6699,311,387,6380,323,41834,682,279,892,11,719,304,8903,11,1694,264,2748,649,387,79953,323,3063,311,8395,9994,13,2435,6420,430,3495,5039,430,6699,527,810,4461,311,3217,8395,9994,1109,2626,29509,627,198,791,19114,5900,389,311,7664,872,1866,990,439,264,54595,11,902,18065,52997,323,27252,46679,8395,9994,1555,35936,323,4967,7620,13,2435,10552,1268,814,1005,12823,1778,439,8631,6373,11,71705,11,323,14604,19812,311,1520,6699,37586,449,279,18651,315,39040,32968,627,198,3923,596,7185,374,430,279,19114,34945,1701,7013,10688,320,76,4558,8696,409,3091,588,2249,8,311,15806,279,27375,315,872,21623,2068,13,45863,11,814,6767,279,2237,315,89942,304,279,7013,320,2629,2249,409,89942,2107,6374,556,705,902,374,264,11381,315,21249,8631,627,198,791,36815,10548,449,279,19114,45391,1268,1070,596,912,832,7321,2269,1220,23148,6425,369,1694,264,1695,2748,11,323,430,9455,10105,374,459,14529,1920,627,198,28589,11,420,1495,8111,311,387,264,3463,10039,85,10979,10430,389,279,11774,315,49058,323,279,12939,315,45777,4954,46679,1664,33851,13,128009],"total_duration":8667164871,"load_duration":232840,"prompt_eval_count":672,"prompt_eval_duration":1290549000,"eval_count":248,"eval_duration":7375949000}
