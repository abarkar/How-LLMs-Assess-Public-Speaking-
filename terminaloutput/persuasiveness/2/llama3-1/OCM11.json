{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-11-20T11:42:53.903569874Z","response":"This appears to be a transcript of a spoken text, likely a lecture or presentation. It is a personal and emotional account of the author's experience with the theme of gay concentration camp prisoners during World War II.\n\nThe speaker begins by referencing Virginia Woolf and reflecting on their own life experiences, mentioning that most people they have known are deceased due to not having had the strength to overcome challenges. The speaker then shares their own desire to understand why 15,000 gay men were deported to concentration camps, and how this experience has led them to explore the theme of gay persecution through literature.\n\nThe author describes reading about the experiences of these prisoners, including the harsh conditions in the camps and the violence inflicted by the SS. However, they also note that many of these prisoners kept their experiences silent, only wanting to survive the day. The speaker expresses feeling nauseated and unable to hear the cries and pleas of these prisoners due to the silence surrounding their experiences.\n\nThe author then explains how they turned to literature as a way to process this experience and has consulted hundreds of books on the topic of gay concentration camp prisoners. They describe feeling a sense of passion and compassion for these individuals and wanting to share their stories with others.\n\nThroughout the transcript, there are moments where the speaker's emotions and passion shine through, as they express a desire to break the silence surrounding this period in history and to give voice to those who were silenced. The author concludes by emphasizing the importance of vigilance and remembering the experiences of these individuals, lest we forget and allow similar atrocities to occur again.\n\nOverall, this transcript is a powerful exploration of the theme of gay persecution during World War II, and serves as a testament to the importance of preserving the stories and experiences of those who were silenced or marginalized.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,14465,757,5945,10176,729,294,31109,17571,409,13286,47400,69,13,622,34155,4635,84,48488,409,48577,7010,7643,17536,13,5034,628,455,472,294,6,40997,84568,15132,10237,288,13,11876,46106,11,4864,3625,16796,824,1072,288,66021,1744,4864,308,34155,6502,15925,1208,5457,409,30517,261,1208,56949,13,6178,72,11,503,34155,55162,10036,30517,261,20662,56949,13,622,34155,55162,10036,60946,265,87320,220,868,220,931,28408,61244,84764,1188,24560,7591,403,5512,7010,3625,29135,409,29449,20545,13,29124,66,2182,89,11,90053,409,17317,11,9189,326,6,306,73602,949,9648,414,409,17317,11,3900,379,264,514,21847,13,62463,53542,11,41518,355,7010,3625,32118,438,417,409,326,6,90446,11,46152,14848,24560,7591,403,5512,7010,951,29135,409,20545,13,445,6496,1481,300,11,514,42775,1826,19259,519,7010,3625,1841,462,31539,13,11876,4020,1725,409,5634,969,593,951,18679,7245,84,688,1765,3625,4046,331,1572,2126,65,14014,13,11876,2107,2469,71151,3625,16806,11,10071,46152,841,834,306,55455,13,27058,62998,949,4366,346,934,85217,5320,29580,71686,23589,265,3869,29449,9880,13,12623,4864,41380,2852,27750,46681,409,326,6,90446,11,1880,5636,503,49152,2852,1208,4415,355,8047,13,14465,308,6,1138,344,2852,6502,3869,69379,265,3625,60053,11,3625,82113,8467,409,27750,7591,403,5512,13,14465,308,6,306,408,2852,35597,1744,514,21847,13,1708,1105,11,4864,757,36731,259,3514,978,5553,1208,60642,14081,1598,13,19421,272,17771,28463,514,70927,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,622,34155,8666,978,951,2960,33903,1880,951,2960,33903,294,6,283,19456,1154,1765,1208,7591,403,367,28408,31037,13,81245,87651,5808,1188,3869,1647,16536,4618,27750,7591,403,5512,13,6178,72,11,4864,841,348,11206,2852,6502,1744,7643,60120,325,45441,17475,13215,8047,32592,326,49455,301,409,1208,305,8511,13,622,34155,93974,1880,503,34155,93974,27750,6959,13,622,34155,912,2496,72,13,100178,11,35597,294,81979,6959,13,19421,74699,11,46152,15132,39015,13,622,34155,2579,434,258,978,3625,326,4558,85,417,13,622,34155,2579,434,258,978,3625,20043,2249,409,27750,7591,403,5512,13,81245,15132,409,1055,355,11083,1448,31539,13,46706,653,4046,10946,409,11939,11,409,30481,1744,1208,60642,14081,1598,757,29557,83,1339,11,4864,3625,16796,63034,5512,7010,3625,46496,13,19421,46152,296,6,546,44314,978,13,19421,503,6,25632,12339,68226,9189,20028,97448,75804,88253,7643,11939,5019,3846,42775,13,356,17771,653,42775,11,4864,5534,2852,11,294,6,1132,978,38469,60642,76743,556,13,7695,6824,68,11,9189,514,23933,10333,3846,21847,11,41091,503,34155,6233,648,409,514,1437,12329,13,622,34155,6233,648,409,69241,9779,514,21847,1370,951,78199,13,19421,26725,3625,78199,7930,757,87651,77065,3869,326,6,461,4618,11,26725,3625,78199,1744,4864,41380,7010,27750,10083,598,11,503,34155,6233,648,409,3625,22641,261,294,6,370,541,665,41091,1880,76826,409,9189,3625,20028,97448,13,62463,53542,2922,6496,11,46152,841,15132,6502,60019,10237,82,13,81245,3073,306,13,81245,15132,7010,12155,1495,288,13,81245,15132,7010,3625,47289,6489,625,1154,13,81245,15132,7010,26725,3625,78199,934,85217,14848,1208,1056,5512,13,34447,6666,13,58201,321,685,13,62463,76145,1794,65,417,5019,969,1188,19443,404,15878,1744,54613,841,274,41901,264,716,20822,535,13,19421,45575,11,39043,87264,22299,6316,38883,523,2070,409,628,2925,1437,285,519,42067,4046,566,266,519,13612,321,294,6,39883,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2028,8111,311,387,264,36815,315,264,22066,1495,11,4461,264,31678,477,15864,13,1102,374,264,4443,323,14604,2759,315,279,3229,596,3217,449,279,7057,315,8485,20545,3190,28240,2391,4435,5111,8105,627,198,791,19114,12302,555,57616,13286,47400,69,323,42852,389,872,1866,2324,11704,11,45391,430,1455,1274,814,617,3967,527,43720,4245,311,539,3515,1047,279,8333,311,23075,11774,13,578,19114,1243,13551,872,1866,12876,311,3619,3249,220,868,11,931,8485,3026,1051,68210,311,20545,29135,11,323,1268,420,3217,706,6197,1124,311,13488,279,7057,315,8485,56529,1555,17649,627,198,791,3229,16964,5403,922,279,11704,315,1521,28240,11,2737,279,25984,4787,304,279,29135,323,279,9349,69177,555,279,18679,13,4452,11,814,1101,5296,430,1690,315,1521,28240,8774,872,11704,21737,11,1193,19762,311,18167,279,1938,13,578,19114,61120,8430,49394,660,323,12153,311,6865,279,58845,323,88800,315,1521,28240,4245,311,279,21847,14932,872,11704,627,198,791,3229,1243,15100,1268,814,6656,311,17649,439,264,1648,311,1920,420,3217,323,706,61302,11758,315,6603,389,279,8712,315,8485,20545,3190,28240,13,2435,7664,8430,264,5647,315,11939,323,30481,369,1521,7931,323,19762,311,4430,872,7493,449,3885,627,198,60105,279,36815,11,1070,527,14269,1405,279,19114,596,21958,323,11939,33505,1555,11,439,814,3237,264,12876,311,1464,279,21847,14932,420,4261,304,3925,323,311,3041,7899,311,1884,889,1051,92781,13,578,3229,45537,555,82003,279,12939,315,38494,685,323,48384,279,11704,315,1521,7931,11,64606,584,10894,323,2187,4528,72336,311,12446,1578,627,198,28589,11,420,36815,374,264,8147,27501,315,279,7057,315,8485,56529,2391,4435,5111,8105,11,323,1
