To be honest, I've taken a lovely excuse to watch videos on this tool instead of working on my thesis. More seriously, the internet connects over 17 billion computers, phones, and scenarios. It's the largest infrastructure in human history and at the same time, it's uncountable. A phenomenon without precedent.\n\nAnd that's why all information, whether it's a webpage or a story, is framed as zero-effect in computer science. And on the internet, these linked sequences are called packets. They're transmitted from one node to another, like meters in a postal network. Billions and billions of meters.\n\nDuring their journey, a fraction of packets never make an impact. Because route changes often on the internet. We have cables that get disconnected or material tables that become fixed in a state of frequent change. Very frequently, packet providers like Opera and Magic play it safe. They'll sometimes arrive at multiple resolutions simultaneously. So even if you don't mention packets outside the definition range, you can still see the reality or regulate them. And even for a shark, one wouldn't remove small beautiful packets at the end.\n\nThe guide to my thesis is trying out an estimation program for the quality of care in real-time. Accelerated on your laptops, they'll be sent after and predict conformity, slowdowns, and mutual resolution before you even approach it. I'm focused on these heights on calm heads. I improve, I refine. Not just that. It's computers I've programmed that pass under force watching videos and bringing a multitude of variables like connection quality, site support, etc. All this to facilitate a database, network measurement environments, to raise the video with teachers on a system, to finely model the relationship between connection quality and experience.\n\nThis allows researchers not to understand the quality of experience used by collection, but above all, content providers to optimize sending data they receive. And that second point is very important. Why? Imagine you're returning from France, you open your mailbox and inside, you discover a hundred couriers. Because each of your correspondents, whether it's your grandmother or the taxman, etc., sent their letter in multiple copies just to be sure. That's waste. And that's what happens on this planet, actually.\n\nWhen you watch a video on YouTube, 30% of packets you receive are never used. That's recent waste. Or, Artanet is responsible for 15% of global waste emissions. And that number could reach 14% by 2040. That's as much as I've studied today. So optimize sending packets in the region. Don't forget to limit waste. It's like having a gas on the planet and taking the first step. Managing a packet of greater value.\"","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,13789,708,404,11,4864,36731,52571,324,665,98947,51307,2428,13,9648,519,13510,1744,503,34155,52579,6316,39892,28391,5019,45347,7643,270,4558,325,3869,5363,261,951,72886,1765,326,6,31258,13,12623,47528,43765,11,8191,59644,9465,220,1114,2606,81560,294,6,8904,1759,11,43116,17144,1880,1156,10610,10308,13,356,17771,326,6,13885,10527,1208,5636,348,5642,409,326,6,90446,409,326,6,26380,13109,1880,665,27584,27138,15878,55056,261,13,1252,1343,98078,48099,15878,51625,15433,306,13,19421,3846,5019,70375,46206,3625,52571,1759,1744,41091,11,272,17771,653,20272,62097,42551,1880,16968,47371,2852,84,7010,19227,72601,294,6,26125,13,1708,1105,11,43905,2038,11,1744,3846,45441,6316,2199,3566,6033,6316,87810,11,1826,3289,15008,8047,32592,57128,409,1167,56771,67781,409,961,665,51307,2428,13,19421,1765,8191,11,27750,19266,45045,908,14014,15132,3625,75332,2436,409,2606,4918,409,4411,346,12249,934,54386,917,6853,951,7251,91691,13,19421,15132,44351,1380,76,5014,409,6520,40095,665,6520,40095,11,22299,951,296,75104,7010,514,98947,1772,301,13,3959,2606,81560,1880,951,2606,81560,409,296,75104,13,33150,45369,409,28130,84411,698,11,6316,19983,951,7251,91691,308,26248,56316,294,52152,27256,967,978,13,4366,346,1744,514,6149,1765,8191,2349,71151,13,1952,264,951,48924,39863,7591,18424,5512,6033,951,12920,86374,22811,645,13,81245,3567,72,89810,46838,494,2852,653,3335,5155,978,3869,326,57286,266,3930,71151,13,1183,12416,71151,7010,20662,19451,11,3625,81994,15760,1759,409,7251,91691,11,326,6,7271,76743,11,1208,7023,648,11,28068,306,1208,77463,13,27058,9189,22641,261,6316,38920,77818,1765,514,490,1791,11,84568,82133,1370,86633,1370,43406,665,51854,31807,20813,20731,276,42625,13,1219,2727,39043,11,27584,4502,9189,6420,55506,6502,3625,7251,91691,60475,281,9769,645,409,47371,4144,11,9189,5019,23577,42676,27584,25692,85815,46131,1208,59157,13109,6033,665,20028,27750,38682,7607,13,19421,27584,665,653,6016,258,11,326,54386,841,2160,9008,6502,409,86696,387,12249,7251,91691,3869,1208,1913,13,2009,8641,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,272,17771,294,6,434,1155,653,18629,294,17771,5582,409,1208,60128,951,779,1354,665,16578,304,15433,275,13,11683,19010,14081,5512,1765,26317,2700,4893,11,46152,274,41901,424,969,1188,3869,5590,98020,13,81245,274,41901,424,969,1188,42138,1880,27389,85,9008,1188,514,26965,1133,11,3625,436,69261,15760,1392,1880,1208,31807,3294,5318,31037,33670,27584,1744,9189,841,326,6,370,541,74466,13,14465,36731,15522,12416,3869,27750,20605,1821,1765,3625,259,90276,3930,1652,2727,13,622,58591,73511,461,11,4864,296,6,371,57609,13,2998,55455,1744,39043,13,24703,15132,3625,6141,3357,1759,1744,503,34155,56586,5512,7930,1522,306,3869,5457,8065,21273,788,13,19421,7930,5363,306,951,72886,665,66517,519,2961,1553,6316,49068,409,7482,11,22299,1208,60128,951,4635,327,919,11,514,2816,409,1862,11,5099,13,80905,39043,5019,58424,2058,6316,2385,409,46681,11,951,7625,53819,409,11083,1439,9517,325,12249,11,5019,5945,72905,3869,1208,57146,9952,951,68061,625,1821,1765,653,72601,11,5019,1491,19010,12329,1913,1133,1208,12976,9465,60128,409,1208,73876,1880,60128,294,6,4683,65679,13,64105,64,29557,6502,55133,479,10253,52571,1759,409,841,6502,60946,265,1208,60128,294,6,4683,65679,42587,8047,1370,514,6667,68,11,10071,76776,10253,81994,15760,1759,409,76354,294,6,19680,12329,326,6,3239,6870,951,46681,934,54386,264,312,3209,1157,13,19421,3846,2132,1486,1826,25945,3062,13,27058,62998,949,38891,89,934,41901,5790,376,519,3869,9822,11,9189,6033,85,23577,15265,44402,409,6667,68,1880,3869,326,55624,57663,9189,59148,85,23577,6316,2960,8511,409,4020,75,85460,13,4366,346,1744,95917,359,409,26317,8024,1821,11,1744,3846,45441,15265,6800,1474,12339,6033,514,282,3510,11,5099,13,9189,14848,60630,978,28130,70556,665,51854,39039,17724,4046,688,61244,5019,23761,76076,409,1208,80091,13,356,17771,39043,3930,6962,79,48164,13,19421,272,17771,653,28800,3846,7930,513,39904,1765,1208,3197,66522,665,20272,13,3489,438,9189,1239,42441,89,6316,57146,1765,38403,11,220,966,4,951,7251,91691,1744,9189,2215,19610,841,15132,56316,308,355,13,356,17771,3930,6962,79,48164,16968,9517,1189,13,2582,11,5277,276,295,1826,3869,326,6,4775,483,409,220,868,4,951,4046,5287,13509,3916,409,6962,79,48164,13,19421,3846,84064,265,92215,1647,466,55398,81991,220,975,4,294,6,3457,220,508,1272,13,356,17771,3154,519,1744,3846,1744,503,34155,14240,21178,978,75804,88253,13,1708,1105,11,7706,1082,89,326,6,3239,6870,951,7251,91691,7010,1208,88100,13,328,41901,5945,1055,10333,6502,5019,4671,2058,514,6962,79,48164,13,356,17771,653,28800,22299,4502,9189,1860,74466,653,56086,1765,1208,3197,66522,1880,39587,653,21134,6502,13,480,14081,519,294,22827,7251,24181,409,5636,409,51304,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5084,1093,499,617,264,36815,315,264,8982,477,15864,304,8753,11,25394,279,8712,315,4009,14054,323,10361,18874,389,279,7757,627,198,8586,596,264,11413,14807,1473,1,15571,11714,11,358,2846,264,32185,304,6500,14488,13,2057,387
