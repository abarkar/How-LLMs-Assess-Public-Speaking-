But that's not exceptional, since most living organisms use this mode of respiration. During my thesis work, I'm interested in tiny marine organisms that can temporarily live without oxygen in sediment, which covers the ocean floor. Who are these incredible microorganisms? They're foraminifera, like Nonionella, caricatured here by Noni. They resemble small shells, but they're neither animals nor bacteria. The goal of the first part of my thesis is to understand Noni's life and chemical environment. Noni lives in a fjord in Sweden. A fjord is a marine inlet between mountains, and in winter, the rolling waves of ocean currents don't have a name. They don't bring enough oxygen to the bottom of the cuvette. This lack of oxygen is called hypoxia. And that's an extreme condition for life. Several solutions present themselves to organisms. Either they die, or they flee, or they adapt. Recently, international colleagues discovered that some foraminifera, without oxygen, are capable of breathing nitrates and exhaling nitrogen, like Noni. That's what we call denitrification. So you think, nitrate equals pollution? Pollution, yes, but not just that. You shouldn't forget that nitrates are first and foremost an essential molecule for marine life and plant life. You understand? It's simple. No nitrate, no plankton, no plankton, no fish. And well, once oxygen has been consumed at the bottom of the cuvette by bacteria, other molecules form. Nitrates, but also metals like manganese and iron, then sulfides. Imagine an oceanographic campaign in Sweden in winter. So it's already night, cold, and on top of that, it smells rotten egg due to sulfides. Good morning to the ambiance.\n\nIn my first scientific article that I'm writing, I've managed to quantify Noni's respiration and map out its chemical environment in two dimensions. Showing that Noni, along with its thousands of brothers and sisters, are capable of consuming all the nitrates contained in the sediment of the fjord. Making Noni a bio-indicator species for a medium rich in nitrates and poor in oxygen. Super. But what's the point of knowing this, finally? Well, you should know that these days, certain areas of the ocean are being depleted of oxygen due to our human activities. And well, studying denitrifying foraminifera, like Noni, allows us to follow the long-term evolution of these areas and provides a means to understand and predict the impacts on the functioning of marine ecosystems. But I'll need more than 180 seconds to tell you everything.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,2998,3846,4545,11,15878,9189,665,98054,42463,11,9189,9216,60836,409,326,6,61263,70,48099,1880,33663,89,3930,65570,4223,451,409,1841,20337,13,34447,3846,308,17771,6502,4788,8301,11,44829,593,1208,3682,13109,951,20183,45632,18434,1821,42587,306,3846,3941,409,594,29579,13,81501,11083,58673,2249,409,270,4558,325,11,4864,296,55624,978,22550,3869,409,1332,26089,2482,47120,288,3678,1354,2107,4893,409,18434,265,2798,6347,47668,15878,99690,70,48099,7010,514,274,15433,3904,11,3846,274,481,7930,259,14041,325,514,21901,951,296,388,1880,951,18274,978,598,13,34447,7930,15132,27750,3709,3433,4893,8162,12,8629,2191,288,949,24703,15132,951,369,8778,333,31539,11,22299,11842,290,6985,11,77071,2693,978,49733,1370,11842,72,13,81245,594,28111,306,3869,409,86696,1080,447,484,1154,11,10071,3846,841,15132,13080,951,4039,12249,11,13080,951,293,533,978,4108,13,445,6,1735,333,409,1208,55133,48901,409,7643,270,4558,325,1826,409,60946,265,1208,17536,409,11842,72,1880,4538,50026,40280,38094,2428,13,11842,72,13458,7010,653,76471,541,665,17360,4558,451,13,1252,76471,541,11,272,17771,6316,7015,58330,294,93847,409,4809,9465,951,20605,3326,288,1880,665,305,1553,11,514,259,14041,436,11206,519,951,2126,1821,3678,1354,308,26248,6502,409,9859,13,7695,308,6,391,45808,6502,8657,285,64656,294,6,61263,70,48099,7010,514,21901,409,1208,7015,58330,13,24703,893,593,294,6,61263,70,48099,1826,76190,978,9950,5241,648,13,19421,39043,11,272,17771,6316,3044,11741,23034,5019,1208,17536,13,12623,46138,10105,274,6,1885,8135,45575,5019,3625,47120,288,13,2100,275,46152,757,77065,11,45441,46152,274,41901,33721,1188,11,45441,46152,274,6,89171,306,13,432,20243,336,479,11,951,4631,4558,70,1157,2655,367,12249,14848,59148,1653,1744,76076,369,8778,333,31539,11,665,19821,294,6,61263,70,48099,11,15132,2107,4893,409,33515,261,951,308,22288,988,1880,294,6,4683,404,261,409,326,6,1394,1295,11,22299,11842,72,13,356,17771,3846,934,54386,917,6853,1208,7591,77,22288,2461,13,1708,1105,39015,11,9189,9189,294,3695,11,25719,7853,4046,70,1604,25793,949,96201,11,97507,11,10071,6502,1744,13,7695,841,47090,6502,220,5599,5741,1744,3625,308,22288,988,15132,33670,16968,6316,22337,20243,1130,4043,23202,6853,3869,1208,17536,29691,1880,3869,1208,17536,348,19395,10515,1604,13,41621,1391,48009,89,949,356,17771,4382,13,24971,409,25719,7853,11,6502,409,3197,302,263,11,6502,409,3197,302,263,11,6502,409,4538,13458,265,10398,263,13,19421,14707,11,6316,37291,1744,326,6,61263,70,48099,264,24560,1615,20372,978,7010,514,21901,409,1208,7015,58330,1370,3625,293,533,978,4108,11,294,81979,22337,20243,2482,513,369,479,13,11876,308,22288,988,11,10071,28463,951,32118,2629,2249,22299,514,296,19148,4558,325,1880,514,18728,11,44829,951,40769,1439,13,38891,89,45325,6316,3190,24812,18274,978,276,3257,2428,11,38891,89,45325,6316,3190,24812,18274,978,276,3257,2428,11,665,17360,4558,451,665,305,1553,13,1708,1105,46939,11,3900,20272,85434,11,3900,20272,282,1607,11,1880,665,5636,11,39043,3288,326,6,4748,1739,5019,462,3869,5353,951,40769,1439,13,13789,30362,326,6,3042,5397,13,46706,514,21134,4652,7330,52760,1744,4864,36731,665,5542,294,31769,68019,11,503,34155,84788,72,3869,10484,3125,1208,594,29579,409,11842,72,11,1880,3869,7558,3257,1291,4538,50026,40280,38094,2428,665,26633,15696,13,3206,376,519,1744,11842,72,11,44351,1744,15907,2606,4918,409,1448,31539,1880,274,52822,1759,11,15132,2107,4893,409,1615,316,1195,1208,2860,13109,951,308,22288,988,687,38965,7010,514,274,15433,3904,3930,76471,541,13,435,2852,519,44351,409,11842,72,6316,16948,4558,346,17332,18251,292,68636,294,22827,83259,436,12333,665,308,22288,988,1880,2267,1260,665,99690,70,48099,13,7445,13,34447,3869,75249,39043,113147,409,47929,39043,11,1913,54960,949,61651,14707,11,9189,87040,47929,1744,409,12155,49301,11,3738,288,26467,409,326,6,511,978,276,15132,665,5542,409,274,53149,2933,63346,665,99690,70,48099,3869,5353,409,12155,4197,35933,2854,33903,13,19421,14707,11,14240,664,1291,3625,369,8778,333,31539,7591,77,22288,13215,1821,11,15890,11842,72,11,29557,409,46932,265,1765,514,1317,98020,326,31769,65272,409,27750,26467,11,1880,21559,653,91116,5019,60946,265,1880,550,15433,556,3625,25949,1765,514,34501,40280,951,4046,9594,599,66474,3678,1354,13,34447,39015,11,3900,757,2267,664,969,5636,409,220,5245,2132,288,11,5019,16968,9189,15473,444,466,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,8586,374,279,36815,11093,449,6498,37793,512,198,7184,11,2085,44114,433,11,499,527,27027,304,24463,323,57759,6260,12782,40589,13,2030,430,596,539,25363,11,2533,1455,5496,44304,1005,420,3941,315,594,29579,13,12220,856,17850,990,11,358,2846,8173,304,13987,29691,44304,430,649,28191,3974,2085,24463,304,59132,11,902,14861,279,18435,6558,13,10699,527,1521,15400,8162,76991,30,2435,2351,369,8778,333,2473,11,1093,11842,290,6985,11,77071,1598,67,1618,555,11842,72,13,2435,52280,2678,44054,11,719,814,2351,14188,10099,6463,24032,13,578,5915,315,279,1176,961,315,856,17850,374,311,3619,11842,7
