It's a combination of personal experiences with a pet cat, Chiara, and the author's work as a geographer studying the metabolism of territories. Here's a brief summary:\n\nThe author starts by describing their daily routine with Chiara, feeding her 50 grams of cat food every day. They explain how Chiara's body processes these nutrients and energy to stay healthy. The concept of metabolism is introduced, which is the process by which an organism (in this case, Chiara) takes in nutrients, transforms them into energy, and eliminates waste products.\n\nThe author then makes a connection between Chiara's metabolism and the metabolism of territories. They propose that cities can be seen as \"giant animals\" that require resources, such as food, wood, oil, and metals, to function. These resources are consumed, transformed, and eliminated just like Chiara consumes her cat food.\n\nThe author highlights the complexity of understanding what a territory consumes and eliminates. They mention the need for gathering data on agricultural production, mining, air and water pollution, waste management, transportation, and more. The sheer scale of these processes is enormous, with millions of tons of materials circulating annually in territories like Alsace.\n\nTo simplify this process, the author uses their computer to develop tools that allow them to manage large amounts of data and answer questions about what a territory consumes or eliminates, where, when, and how much. This enables them to identify areas for improvement and optimize resource use.\n\nThe final message is one of hope: by creating these tools, the author hopes to enable a new profession, a \"territorial diététician\" who can help find a sustainable balance between human economic activity and the planet's natural resources.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,622,34155,653,10065,409,83491,648,11,6316,38920,54951,7930,274,53149,6853,34382,5169,13,34382,5169,11,4864,25400,21559,26725,3625,49301,50026,220,1135,69225,288,409,14425,24181,2392,13,39783,37291,6892,14081,14014,11,27750,14425,24181,2392,82133,513,43678,7010,4538,2942,44618,1880,3127,52424,3625,10184,6417,812,1880,326,31769,64374,934,6,37907,687,72,89810,5019,25400,29557,10367,409,2800,261,8065,1948,409,829,57128,13,362,1208,1913,3930,1920,355,11,3900,66167,45889,7591,331,1441,1744,34382,5169,51913,582,361,32592,57128,409,98385,272,4744,2392,13,5034,10484,13109,294,83508,12843,6892,14081,5512,11,1208,76407,15890,46152,513,1380,2000,479,7010,326,6,8629,44618,1880,3846,7930,665,594,7003,11,16968,39043,11,272,17771,3846,934,54386,917,6853,514,32118,6323,337,44618,294,22827,2942,44618,13,34447,41091,11,4864,841,36731,6502,88704,68,11,4864,308,57286,664,648,6502,3625,47120,288,18434,1821,13,14465,36731,74672,540,4714,383,1880,503,57286,664,648,951,7317,6491,3946,11,951,26886,645,11,951,38682,919,11,951,21935,13,19421,27584,4502,27750,7317,6491,3946,308,6,546,6502,6800,14896,3869,46131,9952,34382,5169,11,46152,14848,11,84440,28463,11,653,32118,6323,337,44618,13,38891,89,6316,39973,22299,653,25500,10065,7010,514,43014,17317,1446,919,26725,665,79071,80444,951,13509,2482,13,19421,14707,11,5019,1744,3846,25500,10065,12,8078,6669,68976,11,44829,325,34501,1215,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,5019,1744,326,31769,45317,648,7364,818,11,17317,3567,2439,29905,12329,951,594,40751,11,951,453,12843,11,3930,66304,11,3930,281,10515,5898,11,951,32118,2629,2249,11,5099,13,48109,841,60534,2439,4046,1325,336,479,6502,60019,40744,27750,594,40751,11,10071,17317,3625,1615,316,24483,11,3625,5276,2439,1880,3625,312,15769,2439,11,16968,22299,34382,5169,1615,316,2727,11,5276,68,1880,78467,6672,15907,14425,24181,2392,13,12095,4864,5320,2249,47929,3846,1744,34382,5169,1615,316,2727,11,3846,308,17771,6502,25945,77411,13,7695,8657,275,409,18541,261,15907,14425,24181,2392,33670,409,3625,25400,71751,1880,294,6,25632,52424,934,6,37907,841,893,17187,6502,13,7695,8657,275,409,18541,261,15907,14425,24181,2392,33670,409,3625,25400,71751,1880,294,6,25632,52424,934,6,37907,841,893,17187,6502,13,7695,8657,275,409,18541,261,15907,14425,24181,2392,33670,409,3625,25400,71751,1880,294,6,25632,52424,934,6,37907,841,893,17187,6502,13,34447,5019,47929,3846,1744,1615,316,2727,6033,78467,6672,653,7317,6491,556,11,1208,259,9011,1557,1826,47838,479,5636,6485,68,13,19421,3900,379,264,48488,11,48488,409,46681,3869,51010,36501,13,5034,5788,40574,292,1286,11,326,58736,27523,13726,12339,11,3625,312,75004,5553,326,6,1334,11,5553,326,93847,11,1208,57459,665,7591,14215,11,514,7710,409,15572,438,5014,1880,14707,294,81979,13,33150,2860,11,40744,5634,59307,2389,263,1072,288,11,3846,15132,51854,43386,33903,409,11990,409,52021,7930,4319,29580,46777,76132,1765,653,7317,6491,556,22299,326,6,77968,580,13,362,32384,11,1647,42775,1826,409,52895,716,951,594,40751,11,951,594,40751,7930,15132,70720,11,1880,294,49963,12329,3625,75601,2601,7930,17634,306,5636,4382,1880,5636,51794,326,57286,799,3930,32118,6323,337,44618,409,12155,7317,6491,3946,665,29557,61512,409,51010,36501,1880,294,6,69331,2058,40744,27750,46681,13,27058,45602,11,1647,6141,3357,324,1826,653,4958,84048,25945,8791,458,13,5186,12416,39929,3608,90859,514,955,294,6,26125,934,35329,47090,14951,8646,1880,52895,716,653,18629,7591,8747,978,11,4864,36731,46838,494,2852,13171,409,342,52424,409,38546,10484,35933,294,6,41540,811,13,356,8458,757,29557,409,75871,265,5636,51794,479,3869,96642,4860,3869,31632,409,46681,1437,2142,13,42215,1615,316,2727,6033,78467,6672,75249,949,507,15273,949,3489,438,949,19421,665,74940,10484,13109,949,14465,1446,2852,653,1891,10515,10515,3457,268,7930,76605,48021,34382,5169,8065,38682,547,11,4864,757,1153,81356,3625,123299,9004,4860,13,34447,3846,308,17771,6502,34382,5169,934,35329,47090,48021,8065,38682,547,13,24703,15132,14707,12155,7317,6491,3946,7930,1615,316,479,21965,409,594,40751,11,665,16968,4865,5636,1744,3846,1744,1208,3197,66522,841,25692,5790,283,899,261,13,362,32384,11,9952,1647,42775,11,503,6,25632,12339,75831,3625,704,8839,7930,29557,376,546,3869,653,43453,36252,1291,294,58736,1601,13,39783,80444,409,1891,10515,10515,3457,268,3930,7317,6491,556,7930,46524,64,514,38682,547,10737,978,5019,1744,29449,82653,648,44829,325,2018,8977,3869,34501,1215,27220,479,13,14465,36731,46838,494,2852,13171,409,342,52424,409,38546,10484,35933,294,6,41540,811,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,27387,1495,0,1102,596,264,10824,315,4443,11704,449,264,6896,8415,11,34382,5169,11,323,279,3229,596,990,439,264,3980,42606,21630,279,39097,315,39543,13,5810,596,264,10015,12399,512,198,791,3229,8638,555,23524,872,7446,14348,449,34382,5169,11,26040,1077,220,1135,34419,315,8415,3691,1475,1938,13,2435,10552,1268,34382,5169,596,2547,11618,1521,37493,323,4907,311,4822,9498,13,578,7434,315,39097,374,1
