I'm sure you've already heard about the new revolution called artificial intelligence, or AI. But don't worry, I won't try to convince you that AI is going to disrupt your life. Actually, my thesis concerns the most important part of AI: the I, or intelligence. Imagine it's lunchtime, you're hungry, and you go buy a baguette at the nearby bakery. But when you arrive, you see an enormous dog standing next to the bakery door. You have just a few seconds to decide whether to go in or look for another bakery a bit further away. If I wanted to solve this problem with purely rational approach, I would program equations that take into account my hunger level, the size of the dog, if it looks really mean, and the distance to the next bakery, etc. Because my decision has to be based on something. And now, suppose I take you to my home in India, visit my wonderful country. But my equation doesn't work anymore. First of all, because there, you have to beware of every dog, no matter how small. And especially, even if you're lucky enough to find a bakery that makes baguettes, the next one will probably be hundreds of kilometers away. But it's not a problem, we'll adapt quickly and eat our traditional and delicious... non-Indian dishes. Thanks. And once we return to France, we go back to our old habits and baguettes. That is, we don't forget the old equation, but we adapt according to the context. You and I, thanks to our prefrontal cortex, take this kind of decision every day with flexibility, effectively integrating both rational and emotional criteria. With neurobiologists studying different regions of this part of the brain, we're exploring how they cooperate to give an answer easily. But to test our equations, of course, we don't go to India every four mornings with neurobiologists searching for a bakery with dogs at the entrance. For that, we use video games. Yes, we use Minecraft as a virtual environment. With this game, I can define agents - little AI entities like myself - which use the knowledge of neurobiologists to represent decision-making elements. And we'll be able to observe their behavior in front of a virtual dog at a virtual bakery. And my question is: what happens in our brain when we travel to India and want to eat a baguette? That's a beautiful thesis topic at the border between neuroscience and computer science. Thanks.\"","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,13789,30362,1880,31074,561,978,13,14465,36731,97717,1744,9189,47592,46939,69379,84,89504,409,1208,48659,9517,65272,7930,274,53149,6853,326,55624,8677,1989,1104,72,6853,11,1208,84850,4558,21152,44190,13,34447,841,9189,304,47391,978,668,89,6502,11,4864,841,91507,6502,4043,1155,409,9189,5804,467,846,1744,326,6,5987,11412,16968,30870,273,3078,261,7010,15265,17536,13,2998,20272,11,7643,270,4558,325,3613,68495,1208,48901,1208,5636,36897,409,326,6,5987,11,272,17771,514,358,11,326,55624,8677,13,38891,89,11,3900,1826,326,6,75876,3930,7591,3841,48137,11,9189,47592,2267,318,11,9189,12584,89,99490,6316,9145,84,6672,3869,1208,293,11206,4091,648,3930,16652,13,34447,665,69003,519,11,9189,23933,10333,934,35329,379,264,653,4046,20609,68,523,3675,3869,81337,409,1208,60172,409,1208,293,11206,4091,648,13,41621,47592,45575,45889,65995,409,2132,288,5019,35881,1814,11,1826,54312,934,54386,379,11412,6033,389,11412,23008,9211,6316,47838,293,11206,4091,648,653,28800,5636,78060,13,12095,4864,348,11206,2852,31807,3023,265,3846,80259,9952,6316,3057,1557,10748,479,66901,64829,11,4864,48888,2852,951,4046,447,811,7930,864,7521,306,665,42463,1647,53052,409,2267,318,11,1208,62827,3930,523,3675,11,274,35329,264,326,6,1334,60019,32118,11943,11,1208,6138,409,1208,293,11206,4091,648,46932,5048,11,5099,13,3341,3900,47090,14707,1744,7643,35881,1854,2109,974,13,19421,74699,11,1043,981,2439,1744,4864,9189,991,76,48099,46206,41091,665,2314,68,11,2145,2058,1647,2307,21935,13,34447,1647,4046,447,367,841,15572,68,5636,3930,16968,13,13789,11,55133,479,66021,1744,39015,1481,300,11,3900,348,2784,64972,513,32118,69,1291,409,26725,3625,26883,729,11,27584,3625,5636,86696,13,19421,76776,11,27584,4502,9189,47592,1208,6140,409,46524,6316,293,11206,4091,648,7930,20272,951,9145,14127,2392,11,1208,463,331,8511,35737,78705,55755,3869,951,2960,33903,409,15395,316,75104,13,34447,3846,308,17771,6502,25165,11,17317,682,2439,25945,83457,17317,13253,1880,389,11412,296,4091,12155,14135,36527,1880,7591,416,53819,13,25145,72,13,19421,7591,416,53819,2536,1280,80463,13,34447,87451,29449,54606,665,9822,11,389,312,59976,12155,17536,31355,6183,21237,1880,12155,9145,14127,2392,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,934,54386,308,6,283,2067,648,6502,1208,70311,4046,447,367,11,10071,17317,17317,11142,2439,665,34501,3930,2317,68,13,2582,11,9189,1880,41091,11,77433,3869,29449,49370,60217,333,9598,278,11,389,35456,3846,955,409,35881,1854,26725,3625,49301,9952,5882,40948,978,11,665,57110,52727,2515,91640,26725,27750,4742,31539,11,2536,71686,66901,36527,11,10071,28463,4046,49975,36527,13,62293,3625,18247,8385,16549,288,11,7930,5363,306,96642,38682,919,409,20662,48901,3930,272,5976,2933,11,389,14240,664,648,4068,46152,83170,4558,8135,5019,71751,51794,479,1208,90509,13,34447,5019,38211,12155,4046,447,811,11,14707,97717,11,389,308,59858,11412,6502,665,2314,68,26725,3625,99309,5634,1354,9952,3625,18247,8385,16549,288,3869,1208,38317,294,31109,293,11206,4091,648,9952,951,26883,729,3869,326,6,24677,8047,13,27058,45602,11,389,69152,514,51655,57146,13,507,2005,11,17317,4186,19941,41330,22299,50026,40280,13053,4088,13,62293,3846,51655,11,4864,94297,7591,5589,404,951,13307,13,3959,86696,44190,11,22299,25400,11,7930,42587,306,1208,390,46302,951,18247,8385,16549,288,5019,71925,1992,951,33013,98942,409,35881,1854,13,19421,389,11412,68226,22842,3846,52962,1133,3663,3869,653,523,3675,13053,4088,77558,6316,293,11206,4091,648,13053,31037,13,19421,41091,11,1208,3488,1744,4864,757,17477,11,272,17771,934,17771,54312,7930,513,39904,7010,29449,272,5976,2933,42676,389,45640,665,2314,68,1880,389,76605,296,4091,6316,9145,84,6672,949,29179,321,6496,11,653,72006,70927,409,270,4558,325,3869,1208,4156,20712,951,18247,2445,12242,1880,409,326,52152,2293,2428,13,25145,72,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,32,17104,8753,12,48664,37608,8982,4999,198,8586,596,264,14807,1473,1,82681,323,31074,561,978,13,358,2846,2771,499,3077,2736,6755,922,279,502,14110,2663,21075,11478,11,477,15592,13,2030,1541,956,11196,11,358,2834,956,1456,311,28008,499,430,15592,374,2133,311,24927,701,2324,13,34863,11,856,17850,10742,279,1455,3062,961,315,15592,25,279,358,11,477,11478,13,38891,433,596,16163,1712,11,499,2351,30056,11,323,499,733,3780,264,9145,84,6672,520,279,14373,66244,13,2030,994,499,17782,11,499,1518,459,23205,5679,11509,1828,311,279,66244,6134,13,1472,617,1120,264,2478,6622,311,10491,3508,311,733,304,477,1427,369,2500,66244,264,2766,4726,3201,13,1442,358,4934,311,11886,420,3575,449,32227,25442,5603,11,358,1053,2068,39006,430,1935,1139,2759,856,34906,2237,11,279,1404,315,279,5679,11,422,433,5992,2216,3152,11,323,279,6138,311,279,1828,66244,11,5099,13,9393,856,5597,706,311,387,3196,389,2555,13,1628,1457,11,23289,358,1935,499,311,856,2162,304,6890,11,4034,856,11364,3224,13,2030,856,24524,3250,956,990,14926,13,5629,315,682,11,1606,1070,11,499,617,311,84905,315,1475,5679,11,912,5030,1268,2678,13,1628,5423,11,1524,422,499,2351,18069
