You mention that the ocean floor is often referred to as the \"black box\" because it's so difficult to study and understand.\n\nYou then introduce the concept of biodiversity, which refers to the variety of life forms on Earth. You emphasize that this includes not just the creatures we can see, but also the tiny organisms that live in the ocean floor.\n\nYou explain that these tiny organisms are crucial for maintaining the balance of our oceans and recycling nutrients. However, you note that they are under threat from human activities such as deep-sea mining for minerals like lithium, cobalt, and rare earths.\n\nTo address this issue, you propose a new approach to studying ocean biodiversity, which involves analyzing environmental DNA (eDNA) extracted directly from the seafloor sediment. This eDNA contains genetic information from all the organisms that live in the sediment, including tiny animals like ostracods, copepods, nematodes, and polychaetes.\n\nYou explain that by analyzing specific genes that are common to all living organisms, you can identify the different species present in a given sample. This allows you to create a map of biodiversity in the ocean floor, which can help us understand the impact of human activities on these ecosystems.\n\nFinally, you emphasize the importance of protecting these ecosystems and preserving the tiny creatures that live there. You end with a quote from La Fontaine: \"We often need something smaller than ourselves.\" You're saying that just as our own bodies rely on tiny bacteria to function properly, so too do our oceans rely on these tiny organisms to maintain their balance.\n\nOverall, your presentation highlights the importance of preserving ocean biodiversity and the potential for new technologies like eDNA analysis to help us achieve this goal.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,48109,14464,2439,6316,43905,38920,3197,66522,7010,653,38883,11159,13,48109,326,53149,301,2439,71151,1208,3197,66522,12704,361,13,34447,7010,16968,3846,12704,84,11,3900,379,264,409,1208,30870,68,11,409,1208,34316,283,68,88314,1604,7930,1421,283,49606,514,21901,951,296,388,13,10467,89,45325,11,11083,67,986,11,9622,46138,11,1744,20662,30870,68,11,272,17771,1208,4647,12583,978,409,1208,7479,409,1208,10335,265,949,9878,66522,34316,283,68,11,389,3567,14687,13510,13,2582,11,20662,30870,68,11,30547,3869,12155,20043,2249,11,671,1269,653,11159,1370,543,51453,294,6,2910,3433,4893,98385,293,90276,11,98385,11,97507,11,10071,4043,306,13327,645,5019,326,31769,447,31059,265,409,29449,3197,66522,13,3341,84568,15132,653,7643,43588,3062,409,1208,13826,25108,818,38450,12267,951,18274,978,598,1880,76776,11,84568,264,1748,3869,1421,10993,1208,5634,20712,7930,10390,1395,409,1208,7479,409,326,93847,13,8560,75876,43765,11,27750,98385,293,90276,15132,409,5636,665,5636,3026,582,14014,1370,3625,4197,35933,2854,33903,13,48109,18434,2439,665,3846,4545,6316,3388,3869,326,6,2227,1133,5019,326,6,69331,7709,409,12155,14733,288,88314,3916,13,19421,97507,11,326,6,28400,467,1826,550,49530,3869,79942,78,7215,514,21901,951,296,388,11,5019,665,5066,556,951,1332,76743,2249,11,22299,514,57907,11,514,34928,3223,6033,3625,2024,417,436,5518,13,1708,1105,11,3900,17317,47090,409,31326,1439,38682,1001,811,5019,1760,978,1414,3846,4809,588,4618,2249,10071,4502,11679,35285,2249,4046,9594,599,25253,13,48109,57038,63669,294,31109,98652,31914,580,5019,98054,9621,326,52152,12887,409,12155,88314,288,1880,68226,4046,838,8977,326,6,58400,409,12155,4197,35933,7010,42067,11159,7930,17317,3429,77422,4502,781,396,467,1880,7930,1826,5019,61512,4502,463,1557,409,17317,13,81578,8301,1001,11,4068,2267,6948,5392,788,949,61651,14707,11,17317,58724,951,76145,11,951,49301,11,951,5347,33903,11,4160,556,951,46415,8065,73757,3869,5363,261,9465,3625,41936,409,274,481,5019,379,23008,9211,27750,98385,293,90276,13,19421,3900,379,665,264,628,978,339,461,11,951,2960,33903,11,951,2606,4918,1370,3273,625,8047,409,34316,788,11,951,67094,582,2601,11,951,6293,102504,2601,11,951,38605,8637,2601,11,951,1499,5759,4558,2392,1880,27584,951,62197,5346,3536,11,27750,47120,288,64555,17724,7930,31807,18620,3869,40744,3625,4787,409,17536,11,27584,3869,19637,645,409,326,77025,1330,13,2009,80259,949,356,17771,1744,514,73757,11,39043,35456,3930,27138,13,19421,389,264,63669,294,31109,98652,5636,76608,5019,48908,3869,1208,27584,348,87960,1744,326,6,485,592,7379,13,1708,1105,7010,7643,270,4558,325,11,503,6,19680,1082,6316,48659,3057,1557,11,5636,31914,580,1841,27549,29557,409,85877,440,261,16968,326,6,277,21152,3930,18434,519,13,622,49963,1082,326,6,1846,45,50026,40280,278,1744,503,6,15824,285,2167,1133,409,1208,30870,68,88314,1604,13,7695,687,1188,326,6,1846,45,409,40744,3625,98385,293,90276,7930,379,18434,306,13,14465,1239,42441,76826,951,342,4558,4978,51625,285,11,951,342,4558,4978,665,34561,3869,26725,3625,47120,288,18434,1821,13,65381,9189,11,3869,41091,1880,3869,84568,13,62463,342,4558,4978,11,3846,15132,951,342,4558,4978,2082,16150,417,7930,29557,73468,11,665,3625,7591,20720,519,11,294,6,16288,3625,16948,4558,1634,30179,21938,13,2895,66096,3869,20662,48659,98652,11,665,22209,519,951,30870,288,88314,3916,27389,3532,14014,961,412,7010,514,38900,11,4864,1589,8047,6316,7558,3257,648,409,1208,56594,1986,13109,409,12155,94527,21901,82,3678,1354,13,5034,9757,8511,264,22011,12769,1952,264,71151,63669,294,22827,5636,46110,1744,779,72,13,8345,48109,514,23933,2439,17317,1474,5615,9004,13,51097,293,533,978,4108,39408,2259,645,15132,4043,306,13327,645,13,4072,645,15132,4043,306,13327,645,3869,29449,17536,13,1708,1105,11,61158,301,2439,5392,788,1744,3846,5636,46110,1744,779,72,11,3900,25692,23761,88314,278,13,19421,1760,978,713,2439,12155,21901,82,3678,1354,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,27387,15864,4999,198,8586,596,856,4879,311,63179,701,3137,512,198,2675,1212,555,39686,279,12939,315,1057,54280,323,279,5536,430,3823,7640,617,389,1124,13,1472,6420,430,279,18435,6558,374,3629,14183,311,439,279,330,11708,3830,1,1606,433,596,779,5107,311,4007,323,3619,627,198,2675,1243,19678,279,7434,315,73119,11,902,19813,311,279,8205,315,2324,7739,389,9420,13,1472,47032,430,420,5764,539,1120,279,20566,584,649,1518,11,719,1101,279,13987,44304,430,3974,304,279,18435,6558,627,198,2675,10552,430,1521,13987,44304,527,16996,369,20958,279,8335,315,1057,54280,323,34978,37493,13,4452,11,499,5296,430,814,527,1234,6023,505,3823,7640,1778,439,5655,7962,64,11935,369,34072,1093,57907,11,34928,3223,11,323,9024,9578,82,627,198,1271,2686,420,4360,11,499,30714,264,502,5603,311,21630,18435,73119,11,902,18065,42118,12434,15922,320,68,56420,8,28532,6089,505,279,513,2642,4081,59132,13,1115,384,56420,5727,19465,2038,505,682,279,44304,430,3974,304,279,59132,11,2737,13987,10099,1093,67094,582,30797,11,37586,79,30797,11,24566,266,2
