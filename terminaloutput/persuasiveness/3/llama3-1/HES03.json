Let me translate it into English for you:\n\nOnce upon a time, in a distant kingdom, there was a sad blacksmith who seemed uncertain. This brave man, indeed, was quite stuck. He couldn't produce high-quality pieces. All the parts he forged - vis, carriages, gears - were all rejected and discarded. It was probably due to his simulations. A necessary step in the process. The metal he forged being poorly simulated, his colleagues told him. \"Are you stuck? Then call on us who have specialized machines for fine testing. By testing your metal, you can refine your model and simulations without pressure.\" But the blacksmith said to himself, \"I want to run my tests on industrial presses. My thesis is that I can intelligently exploit the workshop for more independence. If I achieve the same result with my 5-meter-high presses as I would with lab equipment, it will show that it's possible - or even better - to skip expensive testing.\" He installed his presses with a adapted sensor to measure the developed forces. And with three lasers on the fitted tooling, he measured the deformation. He experimented on his equipped presses with simple cylinders cut from steel. The selected test, simple but not simplistic, crushed the cylinders between two smooth plates. The blacksmith found, thanks to this experience, the parameters of the useful model for his science. No more rejects and non-conforming pieces; all these simulations were finally up to standard. But in the meantime, his colleagues had finished their tests. And other parameters were found with success. But for the same material? For the same model? That's not possible. Who is the most faithful? His lab colleagues. It's after all their job. But the discrepancies between them are not too great. With some effort and a few years, one day will come when everything will be settled. The blacksmith resumed his work and lived happily and with many small doctorates. Fin.\n\nI hope you enjoyed this charming tale!","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,7695,43989,6316,37291,11,7010,653,938,7911,3972,781,396,467,11,653,490,17194,369,1414,263,7930,80664,1339,3709,7770,13,24703,34300,40351,11,665,67781,11,43989,14707,8126,49530,978,13,7695,841,1370,1055,1339,6502,3869,6316,51651,60128,13,350,5612,3625,70477,1634,934,35329,57728,1339,11,2145,11,1841,2785,1157,11,2995,1466,1154,11,97958,40744,2098,355,14014,1880,296,5014,3869,1208,7591,14215,13,356,96287,15878,294,2182,1208,2267,1088,3869,15907,47590,13,39783,14240,2070,100243,7930,513,20272,665,1097,546,13,2009,36252,278,934,35329,57728,1339,14240,519,8811,76773,978,11,15907,4631,4558,70,1157,25400,97057,13,12769,2722,4160,321,6496,8126,49530,978,949,435,2852,39587,76190,3869,17317,7930,57038,951,12933,71269,689,1001,27389,85,1157,5019,951,1367,28154,2436,35018,13,2998,1296,519,8941,36252,278,11,9964,5019,13075,11,15878,3577,290,11,7970,3125,8941,83597,1880,51309,47590,13,8345,34447,514,369,1414,263,22011,3869,64160,17274,11,12769,14465,5320,2249,20028,11083,4043,2852,1765,1685,325,67965,6853,13,11583,270,4558,325,1826,1744,4864,94297,9952,11478,7684,2058,326,6,266,68249,5019,5636,294,6,485,978,3825,685,13,12095,503,6,1138,535,9952,11083,54063,409,220,20,296,75104,409,62321,8065,27584,65285,266,1744,11083,281,17724,8065,10278,78,11,45602,1647,376,2473,934,35329,1826,3284,11,37572,64972,11,409,513,45347,409,70375,951,7177,834,3825,53819,13,8345,7695,4685,64,1765,15907,54063,13,1252,2107,668,324,10737,978,5019,11083,7889,8065,64972,3625,9045,68866,5512,13,19421,9952,56321,72475,1765,326,6,412,48164,348,1056,978,11,272,17771,1208,7591,1659,934,35329,264,18757,11083,7889,13,7695,1367,14081,3904,64,15907,54063,1765,978,36847,14014,1765,409,69406,43021,485,417,35881,13649,5512,7010,326,6,54553,13,2009,1296,71132,52235,11,4382,10071,6502,15858,17194,11,4046,5192,300,1339,3625,43021,485,417,9465,26633,12235,12249,326,85460,13,2009,369,1414,263,26483,6723,11,77433,3869,20662,88411,11,3625,1719,75104,3930,83597,8791,458,3869,829,8198,13,5767,72,514,84129,1880,3625,70477,1634,2536,26965,288,11,40744,27750,47590,97958,665,5589,10253,7617,288,13,34447,9465,27138,11,15907,4631,4558,70,1157,384,77065,1913,72,43153,4043,2852,13,19421,294,81979,1719,75104,282,77065,26483,85,5512,9952,94499,13,34447,5019,514,27584,5634,28154,2933,949,27058,514,27584,83597,949,356,8458,841,513,25692,13,7930,1826,514,5636,33204,51453,949,64027,4631,4558,70,1157,3930,10278,78,13,356,17771,42676,27584,28130,30870,9363,13,34447,3625,91329,7183,9465,84440,841,15132,6502,409,21965,13,62293,45889,9045,1880,45889,65838,11,653,9880,3355,61799,514,27138,39723,16968,35737,9517,6200,978,13,2009,369,1414,263,31736,275,39587,4538,42775,1880,3900,45165,10453,77818,2249,1880,84871,409,86696,10896,1900,13,5767,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,50189,3446,0,6914,757,15025,433,1139,6498,369,499,512,198,12805,5304,264,892,11,304,264,29827,26135,11,1070,574,264,12703,3776,34117,889,9508,36218,13,1115,34300,893,11,13118,11,574,5115,16075,13,1283,7846,956,8356,1579,22867,9863,13,2052,279,5596,568,54299,482,2145,11,1841,38132,11,54260,482,1051,682,18010,323,44310,13,1102,574,4762,4245,311,813,47590,13,362,5995,3094,304,279,1920,13,578,9501,568,54299,1694,31555,46836,11,813,18105,3309,1461,13,330,11787,499,16075,30,5112,1650,389,603,889,617,28175,12933,369,7060,7649,13,3296,7649,701,9501,11,499,649,46464,701,1646,323,47590,2085,7410,1210,2030,279,3776,34117,1071,311,5678,11,330,40,1390,311,1629,856,7177,389,13076,54063,13,3092,17850,374,430,358,649,60538,4501,33294,279,26129,369,810,24589,13,1442,358,11322,279,1890,1121,449,856,220,20,73601,28661,54063,439,358,1053,449,10278,7241,11,433,690,1501,430,433,596,3284,482,477,1524,2731,482,311,10936,11646,7649,1210,1283,10487,813,54063,449,264,30464,12271,311,6767,279,8040,8603,13,1628,449,2380,72475,389,279,29441,5507,287,11,568,17303,279,91621,13,1283,98504,389,813,19167,54063,449,4382,75421,4018,505,9699,13,578,4183,1296,11,4382,719,539,78630,11,33745,279,75421,1990,1403,11113,25485,13,578,3776,34117,1766,11,9523,311,420,3217,11,279,5137,315,279,5505,1646,369,813,8198,13,2360,810,60515,323,2536,15204,55857,9863,26,682,1521,47590,1051,5616,709,311,5410,13,2030,304,279,33953,11,813,18105,1047,8220,872,7177,13,1628,1023,5137,1051,1766,449,2450,13,2030,369,279,1890,3769,30,1789,279,1890,1646,30,3011,596,539,3284,13,10699,374,279,1455,37513,30,5414,10278,18105,13,1102,596,1306,682,872,2683,13,2030,279,91367,1990,1124,527,539,2288,2294,13,3161,1063,5149,323,264,2478,1667,11,832,1938,690,2586,994,4395,690,387,23183,13,578,3776,34117,58505,813,990,323,12439,37875,323,449,1690,2678,10896,988,13,5767,627,198,40,3987,499,14333,420,35509,24162,0,128009],"total_duration":13278260861,"load_duration":147201,"prompt_eval_count":563,"prompt_eval_duration":1098128000,"eval_count":407,"eval_duration":12179590000}
