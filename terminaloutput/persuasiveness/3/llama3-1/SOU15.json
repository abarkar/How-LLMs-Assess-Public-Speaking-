As a research scientist in my laboratory, I often ask myself how we can create entire organisms from a single cell after fertilization. My focus is on neurons, the cells that transmit information. How do they position themselves correctly within the organism and connect with each other to form functional circuits? These questions have been well-studied from a chemical perspective, but my project takes a novel approach by examining the role of mechanical forces in setting up neural circuits.\n\nTo achieve this, I use the zebrafish as a model organism. As you can see here, these images were taken about a day after fertilization and show the developing brain with eyes forming on either side and future nostrils above. Within the fish's nose, neurons migrate away from the surface of the brain while extending their axons behind them, connecting with cells in the brain.\n\nThese neurons, like other cells, have intrinsic mechanisms that allow them to migrate and move through their environment. In the case of nasal neurons, surprisingly, even when these intrinsic mechanisms fail, neurons still advance and extend their axons to connect with the brain. It's as if you're watching a car on flat ground whose engine is broken but still moves forward.\n\nThis leads me to two hypotheses: either there are people with brain problems or there are people pushing or pulling the car. The same holds true for nasal neurons. We think that cells in the eye, located below, are actually \"pulling\" these neurons on the side, causing their axons to lengthen and connect with the brain.\n\nTo test this idea, I looked at embryos with a genetic mutation that prevents eye formation. On these embryos, the nasal neurons didn't advance either. These results confirm our hypothesis: that these neurons are essentially identical and therefore don't function without mechanical forces guiding them. This method shows that not only chemical molecules but also mechanical forces play crucial roles during development.\n\nBeyond the zebrafish's nose, understanding the role of mechanical forces in development will shed new light on neurological diseases. So, may the force be with your neurons!","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,46706,1647,9511,67763,11,389,513,17477,6316,3488,79380,4382,11,1880,1744,9189,47592,78705,55755,46939,1153,8047,11,7930,1826,11,4068,389,20272,3625,90551,65,5512,949,33150,48226,6496,409,1208,90509,653,28800,4046,78134,1744,3625,6699,3381,3869,43153,60404,11,17317,389,513,62163,60019,11,4068,11,3869,31632,294,31109,2849,1130,69483,1739,58482,1321,8047,11,389,17782,3869,20028,951,47120,288,1218,4918,11,259,2053,1744,9189,1880,41091,13,24703,7930,296,55624,978,22550,5636,54008,67882,8065,45369,3930,82620,44481,13767,556,11,3846,15132,3625,21850,3233,11,3625,2849,2482,7930,1380,4150,73468,326,6,26125,13,12535,513,2361,77,306,12,8839,8065,7970,842,69596,7010,326,6,8629,44618,11,1880,513,4667,306,12,8839,4495,1133,3625,7120,9952,3625,46106,11,5019,4846,951,46121,34501,36527,949,62463,4860,14848,46939,24560,14707,14240,21178,14014,294,22827,1486,409,48234,38094,2428,11,9952,1208,35881,15170,668,409,22337,20243,2482,7930,1709,1748,3625,21850,3233,11,10071,1208,77701,94943,409,1647,46494,1826,409,5363,261,514,436,57332,951,8603,32118,4919,8467,7010,1208,57459,665,2035,951,46121,21850,6863,2249,13,27058,45602,11,503,49963,1082,514,83597,3930,3273,49363,1167,4558,21152,11,22299,9189,45366,514,46131,49733,3869,96721,11,9952,951,5448,550,5014,11,45441,409,3663,11,45441,1765,514,81337,13,62463,5448,14848,24560,550,5014,3869,50026,653,9880,42138,1208,37194,68,11,1880,665,15932,519,1765,1208,83067,409,326,6,9034,894,263,11,9952,514,73757,11,22299,1765,326,78337,8065,12541,11,389,25692,46131,514,272,5976,2933,7930,513,52895,375,11,9952,409,46777,81337,3625,20043,2249,7930,513,369,479,11,1880,8065,89429,355,11,3625,37923,44669,1572,3930,3273,49363,13,46706,1208,44669,483,3930,3273,49363,1167,4558,21152,11,3625,21850,3233,29444,8135,665,274,31769,385,59110,409,1208,7479,3930,272,5976,2933,11,16968,665,682,647,68,519,2761,65220,84440,653,1317,46496,11,326,6,710,606,11,77433,8065,43014,46152,513,4667,306,9952,3625,2849,2482,3930,272,5976,2933,13,356,17771,326,78337,934,54386,25692,46131,3869,7118,635,13,11876,21850,3233,11,16968,22299,3625,46106,2849,2482,11,14848,951,32118,4919,2191,288,10805,1354,4558,14295,7930,28130,29557,73468,409,9971,261,1880,294,49152,11967,7010,28130,50026,40280,13,46706,514,4865,951,21850,3233,409,1208,44669,483,11,13051,11,27584,87158,27750,32118,4919,2191,288,10805,1354,4558,14295,841,34501,77,306,6502,11,3625,21850,3233,1860,1149,306,1880,14240,29293,28130,3944,606,5019,513,4667,261,9952,514,272,5976,2933,13,356,17771,653,28800,22299,4502,389,5363,1339,6316,81645,1765,653,25911,46089,11,15890,514,88486,324,1826,45324,978,1880,934,54386,1208,23933,1339,42676,27584,1860,11967,13,1952,25692,45575,23423,261,3869,26633,45455,4558,9459,11,45441,3900,379,264,951,47104,7930,14848,951,52088,66474,409,272,5976,2933,11,45441,3900,379,264,951,47104,7930,17258,784,306,1208,81645,11,45441,3900,379,264,951,47104,7930,1208,28387,406,13,356,17771,1208,27584,14896,5019,3625,21850,3233,409,1208,44669,483,13,1952,73953,1744,3846,15132,3625,2849,2482,409,326,6,52822,321,11,7930,513,10109,306,665,21273,788,11,7930,28387,406,3625,21850,3233,409,1208,44669,483,1765,514,81337,11,83786,25108,52985,326,65948,647,1133,409,28130,3944,606,11,77433,8065,43014,46152,513,4667,306,9952,514,272,5976,2933,13,27058,77680,3125,20662,887,8047,11,503,34155,5363,978,951,44481,2439,7930,14848,6316,27472,78422,99188,1880,7930,841,369,479,6502,294,6,52822,321,13,622,34155,33614,1744,1765,27750,44481,2439,11,3625,21850,3233,409,1208,44669,483,308,49152,1149,306,6502,13,62463,100246,3355,89810,2389,404,1195,29449,45455,4558,325,11,65735,1208,88265,3625,21850,3233,409,1208,44669,483,11,15132,5636,6033,40970,3608,8467,11,1880,39587,11,46152,841,34501,77,306,6502,13,356,17771,6316,98652,65735,1208,88265,3625,2849,2482,409,326,6,52822,321,28387,406,3625,21850,3233,409,1208,44669,483,11,1880,20605,265,934,35329,308,59858,264,6502,1744,3625,22337,20243,2482,38094,8467,7930,15132,75419,8065,45369,3930,82620,11,10071,28463,3625,8603,32118,4919,8467,13,33150,48226,6496,409,1208,44669,483,3930,3273,49363,1167,4558,21152,11,64972,60946,265,514,436,57332,951,8603,32118,4919,8467,8065,45369,3930,82620,1469,403,2473,653,35462,4046,49272,425,1765,3625,8811,17491,3930,72601,32015,2249,13,1708,1105,11,1744,1208,5457,45441,9952,26317,21850,3233,758,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,27387,8712,0,1666,264,3495,28568,304,856,27692,11,358,3629,2610,7182,1268,584,649,1893,4553,44304,505,264,3254,2849,1306,36214,2065,13,3092,5357,374,389,34313,11,279,7917,430,30382,2038,13,2650,656,814,2361,5694,12722,2949,279,47120,323,4667,449,1855,1023,311,1376,16003,46121,30,4314,4860,617,1027,1664,5594,664,1142,505,264,11742,13356,11,719,856,2447,5097,264,11775,5603,555,38936,279,3560,315,22936,8603,304,6376,709,30828,46121,627,198,1271,11322,420,11,358,1005,279,1167,3141,15817,819,439,264,1646,47120,13,1666,499,649,1518,1618,11,1521,5448,1051,4529,922,264,1
