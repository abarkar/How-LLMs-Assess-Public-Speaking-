In other words, what's the difference between a bridge and the human body? Well, inside the human body, there is a skeletal structure, whereas in reinforced concrete, there is an armature made of steel. Imagine a bone disease like osteoporosis. When bones are weakened and no longer fulfill their role, the body becomes weakened. Similarly, when the armature in reinforced concrete is corroded, it can lead to significant damage to the bridge.\n\nCorrosion of the steel armature is caused by two aggressive agents: carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and chloride ions present in seawater and marine shadows. These agents try to penetrate the concrete until they reach the steel armature. Once corrosion begins, rust forms, expands, and causes cracks in the concrete. It's easy to imagine the consequences.\n\nMy work focuses on developing tools to help engineers predict and anticipate the risk of corrosion in reinforced concrete structures. These tools are mathematical models that are straightforward to use, inexpensive in terms of calculation time, and accurate.\n\nHowever, things get complicated now. I'm interested in predicting the initiation phase of corrosion, which corresponds to the time it takes for the aggressive agents to reach the armature level. This duration depends not only on environmental conditions (temperature, humidity, and agent concentrations) but also on the concrete's ability to delay their penetration. This ability is translated into performance indicators.\n\nFor example, a high-temperature concrete has a 100-year performance lifespan. The current regulation assumes that an structure's service life is reached once corrosion begins. Without making the parallel, humans are considered dead once they become sick. Which isn't always true!\n\nThe unique aspect of my research is integrating the propagation phase of corrosion into the structure's lifetime. This duration allows for a small opening of 0.1 mm. A tiny scar. At this stage, the structure's mechanical performance remains unaffected. The risk of collapse only becomes significant when corrosion reaches advanced stages.\n\nYou've understood correctly. My research aims to help and guide engineers in optimizing and maximizing the service life of reinforced concrete structures. This lifespan often exceeds the average human lifetime, which creates frustration but also hope that today's bridges built with today's techniques will last. And this is not just a fleeting
