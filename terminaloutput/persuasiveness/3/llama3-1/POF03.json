You're absolutely right, when I say \"Marquesas Islands\", you immediately think of tattoos, haka (Maori dance), Jacques Brel, and Paul Gauguin - the famous artists who have been inspired by this archipelago in French Polynesia. But there's more to it than just that.\n\nYou know that the Marquesas Islands are particularly rich in large pelagic fish, such as tuna or mahi-mahi. The secret to this abundance is the availability of food for these fish. And yes, there's a lot of phytoplankton - those tiny microalgae that are eaten by small fish, which in turn are eaten by larger fish. Phytoplankton is like the grass of the oceans, providing sustenance for marine life.\n\nIt requires light, nutrients, and oxygen to grow, just like grass does on land. Without it, there would be no food for the fish, and the oceans would be barren. But in the Marquesas Islands, we're lucky to have an abundance of phytoplankton. And yes, we can observe strong concentrations of these micro-organisms around the islands. This is what's known as an \"island effect\".\n\nNow, I know you're all curious about why there's so much phytoplankton there. Well, I'm an oceanographer and I've written my thesis on this very topic. But unlike what you might think, I haven't set foot in the Marquesas Islands or boarded a ship to collect data. No, I use something called numerical modeling - essentially using physical and mathematical equations with powerful computers to reproduce what we observe in the oceans.\n\nWith satellite measurements and models, I can study not just what's happening at the surface of the water but also below it. And unlike field observations, which are scarce in the Marquesas Islands, I have continuous data over time and space. The best part about modeling is that I can test sensitivity by tweaking variables like current strength or nutrient levels to see how they affect phytoplankton growth.\n\nToday, thanks to these models, we've been able to show that the biological enrichment in the Marquesas Islands was due to both physical and biological processes - particularly the input of iron nutrients from the islands and the generation of vortices behind them, similar to those found behind rocks in rivers. So I hope you now have a new idea, a new perspective on the Marquesas Islands!","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,61651,11640,11,1077,7675,11,13835,269,3444,13,12095,4864,9189,834,326,6,1132,82179,951,3678,447,5014,11,3869,75249,73953,89,45325,949,1708,1105,503,98279,24281,46939,1744,9189,73953,89,46939,8065,72813,283,425,11,8065,305,13637,11,1208,9279,325,409,326,6,69289,2933,11,6033,35597,64850,426,3833,6033,7043,18879,30885,258,13,34447,3625,3678,447,5014,11,3846,308,17771,6502,1744,39043,13,19421,97507,11,3665,89,45325,1744,326,6,1132,82179,1826,54008,67882,436,12333,665,94527,58883,38448,64032,13667,8467,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,951,58883,38448,259,2053,1744,514,270,263,6033,514,1871,61952,11,514,44316,72,1474,52206,13,2009,6367,409,20662,9257,24201,11,3900,379,264,48488,409,46798,1018,554,5019,3625,58883,38448,13,19421,97507,11,3900,379,264,48488,409,37555,99705,1201,783,13,2009,37555,99705,1201,783,11,3846,15132,27750,8162,19308,70,1157,7930,82133,23761,51296,14014,1370,409,86696,58883,38448,7930,84440,1474,5615,9004,82133,23761,51296,14014,1370,409,5636,25500,58883,38448,13,2009,37555,99705,1201,783,1826,39587,1208,2385,409,1208,13826,25108,818,38450,12267,29691,13,46408,25692,23761,48234,22299,1208,12077,1559,951,18274,978,598,13,19421,39587,11,22299,326,6,1964,1395,11,5019,513,52895,716,11,3900,264,63669,409,41263,20712,11,409,10184,6417,812,1880,294,6,61263,70,48099,7930,15132,7010,326,93847,13,16770,11,514,37555,99705,1201,783,13,328,35329,308,59858,665,50590,6502,11,6502,409,46798,1018,554,5019,3625,58883,38448,11,951,18274,978,598,7930,15132,348,3422,13,34447,10253,2947,447,5014,11,389,264,1208,6140,294,49152,13603,48488,409,37555,99705,1201,783,13,19421,97507,11,389,11412,68226,22842,409,369,2392,32466,409,27750,8162,12,8629,2191,288,90053,951,14701,645,13,19421,272,17771,3846,1744,326,54386,917,6853,653,67781,294,6,25108,273,13,19421,14707,97717,11,22299,9189,62299,26725,2917,53819,11,9189,9189,7631,10333,11,10071,87320,3900,379,264,48488,409,37555,99705,1201,783,39015,1481,300,949,19421,272,17771,39015,1744,503,55624,651,80463,13,14465,36731,18274,978,276,540,4714,383,13,19421,503,34155,20272,7643,270,4558,325,1765,326,6,511,978,276,3257,648,13,14465,326,34155,20272,11,22011,514,3678,9383,3675,13,34447,32150,47668,3869,3846,1744,326,54386,92215,14425,556,11,4864,308,34155,56316,5906,3625,44630,82,10253,2947,447,5014,13,14465,308,34155,56316,80701,64591,3869,39002,294,22827,8235,556,5019,48908,379,20028,951,11083,1439,13,19421,2536,11,503,49963,1082,3846,1744,326,54386,917,6853,653,83597,1661,78129,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,934,81991,326,26248,579,294,31769,447,811,4571,8467,11,7033,978,8637,8467,1370,86633,25945,61907,3742,11,9952,951,6141,3357,1759,7930,82133,23761,25945,18757,1056,1821,11,389,11412,68226,96586,14843,556,3869,28800,84364,3846,1744,326,54386,23846,7010,3625,18274,978,598,13,9605,3846,45441,1208,64441,11,39587,3625,2126,1821,3678,1354,11,6033,1208,6160,38469,11,3625,10184,6417,812,11,514,37555,99705,1201,783,13,19421,32150,47668,3869,3846,1744,326,54386,92215,14425,556,11,665,84921,24088,11,9952,3625,1491,85798,11,4864,91507,68226,296,55624,978,676,261,3869,3846,934,35329,379,264,665,21273,788,409,1208,7479,409,326,93847,13,34447,44767,11,32150,47668,10253,11083,1439,409,25911,11,46939,934,35329,308,59858,665,264,6502,48488,10253,2947,447,5014,11,4864,91507,39929,951,46681,665,16513,7010,514,27138,1880,7010,326,77025,1330,13,34447,514,25500,1860,25843,409,1208,1491,19010,8082,11,272,17771,409,68226,20028,951,7177,409,6225,40948,978,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,4864,91507,68226,96586,5790,83110,514,2126,519,11,48416,8977,514,2126,519,11,26514,2743,951,10184,6417,812,11,82779,261,951,10184,6417,812,11,5019,46131,326,6,58400,1765,514,37555,99705,1201,783,13,19421,39587,75804,88253,11,77433,3869,27750,1491,85798,11,17317,57038,18757,48021,665,4046,28580,1744,326,41901,14172,50753,6160,1640,2428,10253,2947,447,5014,43989,294,30872,3869,1208,37291,3869,951,1920,355,4571,8467,1880,951,1920,355,6160,1640,8467,13,2998,54008,1291,11,17317,57038,18757,48021,665,4046,28580,934,35329,379,50590,63669,294,22827,1469,403,409,10184,6417,812,41199,3625,14701,645,11,665,10184,6417,812,282,388,11,7930,3355,61799,1188,513,14091,3023,265,7010,326,93847,5019,96586,57532,1208,5788,665,37555,99705,1201,783,11,10071,934,31769,43310,11,514,2126,519,8065,53052,951,2947,447,5014,29557,83,1339,1208,46680,2214,409,7364,30742,2439,2761,65220,3625,14701,645,11,22299,3846,1744,326,54386,25692,22842,2761,65220,653,938,9211,11,8065,83259,294,31109,44229,20712,13,19421,39587,75804,88253,11,503,6,25632,12339,1744,9189,86768,89,6316,48659,887,8047,11,6316,48659,11376,409,326,6,1132,82179,951,2947,447,5014,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,50189,10652,0,1472,2351,11112,1314,11,994,358,2019,330,12331,14295,300,23028,498,499,7214,1781,315,54742,11,305,13637,320,30635,13915,15612,705,64850,426,3833,11,323,7043,18879,30885,258,482,279,11495,13820,889,617,1027,14948,555,420,5438,82179,6438,304
