Here's my attempt at translating the text:\n\n\"So, if I were to offer you a trip to Mars? We'd go behind the Moon, towards Saturn, and we'd be there in just six months. Come on, pack your bags, I can feel you're tempted. But, oh, I forgot to mention one tiny detail: you'll get muscle atrophy. In other words, your muscles will dissolve. And without muscles, you won't survive this very long journey. Muscle atrophy is something that affects us all sooner or later. A broken leg in plaster, prolonged halitosis, and we've already lost our muscles. When researchers realized it wasn't just a minor issue, they started testing on mice. First, they made the mice sick, gave them super treatment, but it didn't work. No effective treatment. So one day, these researchers got together. Guys, what if we found an animal that naturally resists muscle loss? Let's focus on an animal that hibernates. I'll cut to the chase - it's the brown bear. It hibernates for five to seven months every year without moving. If I do a quick comparison, a human in the same condition would be so severely affected by muscle atrophy that they wouldn't survive more than three months. There you have the stakes of my thesis. Understanding how the brown bear preserves its muscles.\n\n\"To crack the code, comparing the muscle of an hibernating bear with that of an active bear seemed like a good starting point. And my supervisor knew where to find bears - right in the middle of the Swedish forest. So we decided to go there and collect tiny bits of muscle tissue from them twice a year, in winter and summer. He brings me these precious samples, I file them away on my desk, and then I extract the proteins. They're super interesting. These little workers make all our cells function. And in muscle, they're even more important. It's not for nothing that bodybuilders chug tons of protein. The big problem is that there are thousands of different proteins. And as curious as I am, I want to know exactly which ones are in my samples. Luckily, I have my mass spectrometer. This huge machine will break down the content of proteins in my sample and give me the result as a list. Then I compare the list for the winter sample with the list for the summer sample. And there, I look for the differences. Okay, I haven't finished yet. And then you'll say I'm way off from finding a solution for humans. But don't be so sure. Remember that we had this crazy idea of putting bear hibernation serum on human muscle cells. And then those cells grew! It means there's a molecule in the blood of bears capable of protecting them and working on human muscles too. If we no longer have muscle loss problems in space, then the conquest of the universe opens up to us. And why not one day, everyone meet up on Mars? Thank you.\"","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,19421,4502,4864,9189,1022,41098,653,45640,1765,21725,949,1952,39904,2761,65220,1208,445,2957,11,5216,50253,68,11,1880,665,3869,1069,483,4848,46415,11,389,379,1826,13,1708,41881,11,20272,288,26317,1062,5014,11,4864,6225,1744,9189,62299,16006,5512,13,13789,11,3900,379,264,653,46110,7591,14928,1744,503,34155,220,5599,747,978,409,9189,6420,1215,13,41621,12584,89,23761,93381,21719,294,6,266,22761,648,3167,3395,12267,13,2998,25500,11,26317,24569,82133,21901,265,13,19421,15878,24569,11,9189,841,23589,23577,6502,3869,3846,25945,1317,45640,13,445,6,266,22761,648,3167,3395,12267,11,27549,17317,15119,1557,26725,11,653,9880,6033,326,49455,265,13,39783,20673,1395,7010,514,628,9011,10367,11,653,15104,275,1133,33482,978,11,1880,389,41518,46939,12155,24569,13,3489,438,3625,52571,1759,513,15132,17634,355,42463,1744,3846,308,96287,6502,4502,459,347,258,11,46152,14848,65385,978,3625,4043,2852,1765,951,20897,285,13,423,6,370,541,11,46152,3625,17634,306,8811,3536,11,46152,28130,33537,306,653,2307,89714,11,1880,14707,665,20272,11,39043,841,15572,68,6502,13,24971,409,89714,60019,31914,580,13,1708,1105,653,9880,11,27750,52571,1759,513,15132,9517,359,285,13,13789,11,3625,342,1590,11,4502,389,26483,85,1339,653,35462,9392,294,6,1617,20234,949,1952,92215,274,55624,978,676,261,3869,653,10065,7930,31807,17194,7138,75,1001,3869,1208,281,14140,3167,3395,12267,13,14465,9189,671,81,73899,1208,10430,11,10071,46152,15132,1913,54960,44180,5512,294,69537,541,13,445,6,2530,305,18127,519,11,272,17771,25400,934,35329,17317,47090,13,1708,1105,41091,2536,5636,11,4864,308,34155,6502,13550,285,13,7695,1826,14707,16968,409,16578,13,34447,272,17771,83195,1744,42676,389,379,9517,1517,978,331,275,11,326,6,2530,42707,11,3900,305,8799,818,13,356,6009,3869,35429,46415,11,26725,3625,8261,11,1880,3846,11,15878,30870,1414,13,12095,4864,66517,653,76608,7809,50848,11,326,6,87713,7010,3625,123299,9004,4787,294,6,12828,29029,8082,87264,19227,1001,93381,396,294,6,266,22761,648,3167,3395,12267,934,35329,841,23589,14687,6502,5636,409,56321,46415,13,7695,43989,39015,326,41901,3841,84,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,1219,59976,265,4068,326,6,2530,42707,11,25400,11,30179,651,1339,15907,24569,13,27058,824,3913,4538,6367,11,93455,514,16124,294,22827,11604,7930,305,8799,818,9952,514,16124,294,22827,11604,7930,1826,1180,333,80664,1339,653,7970,65385,13,19421,1647,30806,11427,1339,39723,46524,951,11604,13,2998,84871,83259,409,1208,369,49530,924,978,3055,1082,13,48109,57038,39587,7591,21200,978,294,6,14283,28130,27389,72905,951,16968,86696,96271,409,24569,11,26633,37291,1370,459,11,665,305,1553,1880,665,24560,13,7695,757,18302,48099,27750,51625,53819,4046,11943,484,2439,11,4864,1052,3869,7643,7251,484,13559,11,1880,39015,503,41901,5066,285,3625,1760,978,1572,13,4072,645,15132,2307,92759,15844,13,24703,15132,3625,98385,6033,85,462,31539,7930,3381,34501,1215,40744,12155,2849,2482,13,19421,7010,514,16124,11,84568,15132,294,49455,519,5636,75419,13,24703,308,17771,6502,5019,55455,1744,3625,76588,288,409,3167,66,2987,41635,306,951,15395,437,409,1760,978,1572,13,2009,25500,80259,11,272,17771,1744,951,1760,978,1572,11,3900,379,665,264,951,2606,4918,96642,13,19421,1744,2917,648,817,22299,4864,36731,11,4864,5320,2249,47929,26077,645,15132,4839,1133,3625,1760,978,1572,7010,11083,4046,11943,484,2439,13,1283,554,43765,11,503,34155,1647,9618,442,99746,409,58617,13,62408,4046,20609,68,5780,11412,35881,371,72684,514,76354,665,1760,978,1572,409,1647,4046,11943,43588,1880,757,98054,514,65285,266,32592,57128,409,34024,13,2998,51092,11,4864,9616,1208,34024,5019,326,31769,11943,43588,294,39982,1553,3869,1208,34024,5019,326,31769,11943,43588,294,6,39883,13,19421,39015,11,4864,52571,3625,44178,63934,288,13,7777,11,4864,308,34155,6502,1913,72,13,19421,39015,11,9189,12584,89,9189,13510,1744,4864,36731,14707,78060,409,46524,6316,6425,5019,326,6,87713,13,34447,308,41901,779,9188,89,6502,4502,97717,13,9424,1055,10333,45325,934,54386,264,15925,326,27688,8047,653,28800,9630,273,409,48021,3930,19266,10952,294,6,2530,305,18127,519,1765,951,2849,2482,409,24569,2854,1771,13,19421,39015,11,3625,2849,2482,14848,20547,72,13,64105,64,76605,13510,934,35329,379,264,6316,22337,20243,1130,7010,514,29340,409,326,6,2530,13171,409,514,1760,978,1414,1880,7930,34501,1215,1339,1765,514,16124,2854,467,13,12095,389,308,26248,5636,409,52088,66474,409,281,14140,3167,3395,12267,7010,326,77025,1330,11,45575,1208,39879,37093,409,326,22827,1986,274,6,283,49606,3869,17317,13,19421,87320,6502,653,9880,11,26725,513,71751,66651,45325,1765,21725,13,25145,72,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5084,430,499,1390,757,311,15025,264,70946,1495,922,279,12939,315,8830,1268,30824,305,19348,323,1268,433,1436,3063,311,42445,82,304,3823,16124,46643,13,5810,596,856,4879,520,67371,279,1495,1473,48058,11,422,358,1051,311,3085,499,264,8577,311,21725,30,1226,4265,733,4920,279,17781,11,7119,50253,11,323,584,4265,387,1070,304,1120,4848,4038,13,15
