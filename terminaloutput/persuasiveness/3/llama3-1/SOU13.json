They provide examples of this rule, such as polar bears being larger than their relatives in warmer climates.\n\nThe speaker then shifts gears to discuss how climate change affects biodiversity. They explain that some species may respond to changing temperatures by changing their location (spatial adaptation) or altering their activity patterns (temporal adaptation). However, not all species can adapt in these ways, and some may struggle to survive due to changes in their energy budgets.\n\nThe speaker highlights the importance of studying the relationship between climate change and body size. They explain that as temperatures rise, animals may need to adjust their body size to conserve energy or maintain a stable energy budget. This could have significant implications for species survival and ecological dynamics.\n\nThroughout the talk, the speaker peppers in personal anecdotes and clever analogies to make the complex concepts more accessible and engaging. For instance, they compare an animal's body size to a box of chocolates - just as a larger box can hold more treats, a larger animal may be better equipped to survive in a changing climate.\n\nOverall, this talk is a great example of how scientists can use storytelling, humor, and analogies to communicate complex ideas effectively.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,1252,9880,11,389,264,84228,64591,1744,39015,39723,3900,20272,70412,11,653,10065,39015,1481,300,1826,71151,40970,25500,13,9424,688,46206,3625,297,1082,12249,6033,35597,46206,3625,36041,333,31539,13,393,1466,2439,1370,51173,653,11604,1499,12267,13,47643,2005,63484,1826,5636,25500,1744,4538,36271,665,8560,2852,648,13,64105,64,272,17771,653,51173,11741,23034,11,10071,39043,15572,68,28463,49733,11,665,56747,12279,6809,11,3869,12366,11,39723,3900,20272,653,28800,9165,4558,451,13,7695,35737,40970,25500,1744,4538,259,546,263,8065,83259,409,1208,17360,4558,451,13,24703,308,17771,6502,6316,3190,24812,409,27389,7611,45973,3625,924,5192,4804,11,272,17771,1208,83229,3491,409,31782,1543,13,2998,6160,540,978,3257,648,11,3900,22011,1744,3625,94527,22641,306,64972,1208,523,61047,1744,3625,86696,13,4418,66,274,35329,20272,70412,1744,9964,1560,21965,25500,11,9964,10025,14295,6316,17508,700,74696,13,622,41901,16796,20272,326,6,4683,65679,11,9165,729,11,6502,5636,62197,934,39982,1291,13,11583,259,13559,409,53050,2098,1607,275,5636,83457,1744,1208,30203,295,20712,13,4418,66,951,4046,19926,30945,8467,13,445,6496,4864,9189,1370,273,409,64441,11,10071,3900,29253,28463,951,2144,38647,6160,1640,8467,13,46706,514,30281,11,42676,326,6,2530,3460,11,3900,20272,653,282,1607,19266,85,12339,13,7695,308,59858,264,5636,55455,3869,296,4091,11,39587,9964,757,1759,665,305,1553,13,34447,4502,9964,1560,5636,6800,11,9964,439,5636,409,31807,13583,13,5250,332,85815,1744,39015,9964,1765,2749,11,8941,34922,1826,6316,712,25108,668,409,78548,13,1611,326,31769,447,11067,5553,3625,281,9769,645,11,4502,503,34155,14707,13550,285,11,272,17771,514,11323,266,7930,6155,57332,13,19421,274,35329,20272,282,1607,11,9964,6800,285,13,34447,87320,949,23126,729,11,272,17771,1377,57332,11,4864,9189,1370,273,409,39043,75804,88253,13,14465,91507,9189,89504,409,11323,266,11,10071,76776,409,2798,14081,1598,13,41621,3665,89,25692,85815,1744,514,11323,266,2349,1880,1744,3625,27138,15132,294,1759,13,9605,20272,1208,56594,1986,13109,3663,8065,2609,1133,11323,266,2428,949,61651,14707,11,39043,7591,3825,951,16948,4558,1634,11,1370,86633,272,17771,13859,266,2428,13,39783,3488,5019,23589,265,11,4068,46524,3930,282,1607,949,4418,66,11,30870,713,2439,5553,514,31837,13,2009,48734,11,39043,35737,40970,70412,39015,1481,300,13,19421,272,17771,1208,55133,951,9517,23475,11,62439,409,2035,13,5034,56594,1986,13109,75871,665,2349,519,7010,326,77025,1330,13,34447,4068,4864,66517,4502,4864,841,94297,6502,30870,1414,949,29749,308,6,300,934,81991,7591,64184,9637,84411,536,294,6,9035,13109,13,5034,296,2227,51111,11,1370,51173,11,20272,15907,60404,5636,259,35657,13,2009,92942,523,13559,5636,62197,7010,1208,85434,5019,523,3376,951,15975,2469,13,19421,272,17771,1208,26633,90272,951,9517,23475,8065,9517,6583,1386,1133,13,5034,56594,1986,13109,75871,665,2349,519,7010,514,27138,13,14465,5320,2249,14707,11,22011,514,85059,2427,6809,11,10071,3900,379,264,653,490,1791,7930,757,342,5615,818,13,11583,84411,536,294,6,9035,13109,1826,29059,8047,7010,11083,342,4558,4978,13,2998,5636,11,7643,47276,11,1647,39646,1826,49733,13,64105,64,841,87264,6502,5636,4382,4502,503,31769,2629,285,70374,5636,46110,13,19421,272,17771,1208,8348,13532,25253,951,9517,23475,8065,2609,1133,11323,266,2428,13,5034,56594,1986,13109,75871,7010,3625,20934,598,4046,39624,10515,8467,13,19421,272,17771,3846,1765,75249,2700,306,11083,58673,2249,409,38317,13,1952,829,275,74699,1744,514,11323,266,1880,1208,62827,15132,409,296,4558,1557,13,34447,4502,514,11323,266,2349,7010,514,27138,11,3625,4039,12249,82133,12,8839,62439,409,62827,5019,3154,519,949,27058,514,47929,11,4864,91507,75144,653,51173,13,1952,69152,653,51655,409,46681,38883,11,951,98733,17724,7930,11083,77065,951,297,1082,12249,7010,43905,1208,9822,13,11246,92759,519,11,27750,77617,3946,409,86696,1880,409,94527,13,34447,5019,1208,56594,1986,13109,11,834,1474,6870,11,665,75249,272,17771,3062,949,61651,14707,11,665,27750,27138,409,25626,23851,11323,266,2428,11,1208,62827,11412,62439,26725,3625,20934,598,4046,39624,10515,8467,13,46408,7958,68,1208,7550,648,951,16948,4558,1634,1765,10335,265,13,64105,64,25692,27584,62439,9637,2035,7010,1208,13826,25108,818,38450,12267,13,5034,24408,33537,8047,3869,1208,62827,27750,36852,4918,27138,11,27549,20605,68,13,19421,272,3433,10333,31307,6033,6502,11,1208,62827,11,39043,42463,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,50189,323,39319,3137,4999,198,791,19114,8638,555,45391,279,31782,1543,6037,11,902,5415,430,8294,10099,8541,311,3974,304,76214,92399,13,2435,3493,10507,315,420,6037,11,1778,439,25685,30824,1694,8294,1109,872,29658,304,46039,92399,627,198,791,19114,1243,29735,54260,311,4358,1268,10182,2349,22223,73119,13,2435,10552,430,1063,9606,1253,6013,311,10223,20472,555,10223,872,3813,320,2203,23241,34185,8,477,60923,872,5820,12912,320,3975,10020,34185,570,4452,11,539,682,9606,649,10737,304,1521,5627,11,323,1063,1253,14993,311,18167
