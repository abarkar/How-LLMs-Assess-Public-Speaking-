You're exploring the idea of how our minds navigate through the complexities of our lives, and how we can better understand how our brains work to improve our creativity, memory, and overall mental well-being.\n\nI love how you used analogies to explain your research. Comparing our mind to a video game is genius! It's amazing how our brains can juggle multiple \"lives\" within one life, without us even realizing it. And I completely agree that it's natural not to understand how our minds work, but it's also fascinating to explore and learn more about it.\n\nYour research on the fragmentation of our lives and how we adapt to changes in our environment is really interesting. By manipulating parameters and measuring participants' ability to adjust, remember, and project into the future, you're shedding light on the complexities of our minds.\n\nI particularly liked your comment about people with Alzheimer's disease losing their sense of orientation. It highlights the importance of understanding how our brains work and how we can better navigate through life.\n\nYour statement that \"we don't need to understand how we function to start living\" is so true! But at the same time, exploring how our minds work can be incredibly empowering and help us unlock new possibilities.\n\nOverall, I think your talk was engaging, thought-provoking, and well-structured. You have a great way of making complex ideas accessible and interesting. Keep up the fantastic work!","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,41621,3665,89,11,3625,48577,7930,14848,1208,8811,329,648,294,6,2149,42360,11,84568,308,6,1138,81541,5636,3869,14707,274,6,15226,261,13,4072,645,513,41518,306,7010,28130,83187,14209,13,34447,17317,11,4068,1826,54312,934,54386,20272,5019,513,38831,15170,7010,29449,14209,11,665,20272,949,356,17771,19227,1001,7138,75,934,54386,841,829,275,6502,60019,13,1952,34512,361,7010,3625,35603,409,29449,14209,11,15878,21965,513,1153,261,409,4860,11,8065,1652,2727,13,4366,51173,11,39015,11,70374,33670,409,96586,49733,11,95917,359,294,6,40997,17317,66517,1339,47838,14896,13,24703,7930,308,26248,55455,3869,46131,9952,3846,7930,513,39904,49733,13,19421,42676,389,961,9008,294,6,3457,11,389,6348,64,26725,67807,84,84595,79071,14896,294,49455,265,7010,29449,17536,13,1611,1208,27584,85722,1744,29449,34922,513,7591,2050,7010,653,1560,1330,64441,11,40321,978,409,10457,2249,11,409,293,64272,12843,11,409,4371,645,11,7010,3625,447,37907,3900,25692,48908,1880,19443,404,11,29449,42563,513,7591,2050,7010,653,1560,1330,10723,11,40321,978,409,924,75004,409,23423,8047,11,409,719,82,11,294,6,9035,35933,11,294,6,21843,78,3946,11,7010,3625,447,37907,27549,11412,1880,5891,1188,11,409,80444,3869,4846,96642,2018,3159,5512,7930,513,14425,285,306,1880,7930,513,67807,84,81541,11,3869,30517,514,27138,13,62463,2018,3159,5512,7010,3625,447,37907,29449,1560,40807,11412,1880,5891,1188,11,27750,2018,3159,5512,1744,326,54386,2322,665,18579,1880,1744,326,54386,312,59976,5636,62197,11,1370,86633,48488,5636,62197,11,42676,389,38831,83384,653,52827,934,54386,308,26248,6502,33614,41199,951,65838,11,1370,51173,11,272,17771,3846,1765,75249,653,51655,42775,273,13,622,6,26577,648,409,60946,265,4068,389,20272,5019,18434,265,951,348,552,15890,514,76354,1826,4502,12569,978,1880,1218,1864,5615,69328,7010,514,27138,13,12535,389,20272,5019,18434,265,51854,98385,348,552,32118,5317,14014,7010,6316,27584,17536,11,665,79071,80444,949,622,57286,664,648,26725,3625,32118,4919,2191,288,409,21063,11,409,32118,97495,11,5906,665,51655,7010,1208,59471,409,27750,2018,3159,5512,11,409,27750,98385,348,552,13,27058,3846,20028,11,4864,14843,285,3869,6316,4046,331,6853,9517,1072,635,1208,88452,409,29449,17536,3869,30517,951,70175,57146,1744,4864,390,68453,13,36684,13324,28068,306,3869,51854,70175,85114,11,46777,51655,91678,519,6316,2018,3159,978,13,65381,31632,409,39015,11,4864,14951,1130,951,1719,75104,5019,44178,63934,1291,3625,70175,1880,4864,84921,1208,23878,13109,951,13324,409,274,6,20311,10253,2609,3808,409,51655,11,409,513,98395,409,3846,7930,274,17771,81621,11,409,513,22040,1430,7010,514,18111,324,11,1880,28130,21063,3930,27138,13,80905,39043,5019,60946,265,4068,64972,45712,261,79988,951,32118,4919,2191,288,409,29449,272,5976,2933,11,1744,3846,45441,5019,64972,342,52424,1208,6485,13109,14425,1056,5048,409,12155,348,552,11,5019,35881,455,1565,29449,34280,20053,13109,11,6033,5019,64972,60946,265,76076,52088,66474,11540,12249,13,1952,25692,25945,14707,18434,265,1880,9465,59976,265,84871,409,79165,15878,60019,60946,265,4068,389,34501,818,13,24703,308,17771,6502,100243,13,19421,9465,17317,11,272,17771,42676,27584,79380,57625,42676,389,379,9517,1517,978,331,275,11,2536,949,423,22827,47838,81337,11,4502,389,50590,63669,409,60946,265,4068,389,34501,818,5019,1081,20099,3869,18434,265,11,389,308,6,4202,1339,56316,59062,978,1880,389,841,87264,6502,39015,13,4366,346,1744,272,3433,10333,1474,6870,11,389,42182,513,272,34858,1208,83067,5019,60946,265,3846,7930,513,39904,7010,29449,83067,13,356,8458,22011,11,4502,389,17782,3869,20028,16968,3846,934,54386,17782,3869,20028,15878,60946,265,4068,389,20272,11,10071,6669,10670,3846,934,54386,92215,20028,4502,389,60946,64972,16968,3846,7930,513,39904,39015,2902,2784,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,36981,11,430,596,264,27387,3137,0,1472,2351,24919,279,4623,315,1268,1057,20663,21546,1555,279,84140,315,1057,6439,11,323,1268,584,649,2731,3619,1268,1057,35202,990,311,7417,1057,28697,11,5044,11,323,8244,10723,1664,33851,627,198,40,3021,1268,499,1511,24291,552,311,10552,701,3495,13,23611,287,1057,4059,311,264,2835,1847,374,35201,0,1102,596,8056,1268,1057,35202,649,503,50428,5361,330,75,1924,1,2949,832,2324,11,2085,603,1524,44114,433,13,1628,358,6724,7655,430,433,596,5933,539,311,3619,1268,1057,20663,990,11,719,433,596,1101,27387,311,13488,323,4048,810,922,433,627,198,7927,3495,389,279,88452,315,1057,6439,323,1268,584,10737,311,4442,304,1057,4676,374,2216,7185,13,3296,63614,5137,323,30090,13324,6,5845,311,7652,11,6227,11,323,2447,1139,279,3938,11,499,2351,80417,3177,389,279,84140,315,1057,20663,627,198,40,8104,15262,701,4068,922,1274,449,44531,596,8624,13490,872,5647,315,17140,13,1102,22020,279,12939,315,8830,1268,1057,35202,990,323,1268,584,649,2731,21546,1555,2324,627,198,7927,5224,430,330,906,1541,956,1205,311,3619,1268,584,734,311,1212,5496,1,374,779,837,0,2030,520,279,1890,892,11,24919,1268,1057,20663,990,649,387,17235,66388,323,1520,603,15405,
