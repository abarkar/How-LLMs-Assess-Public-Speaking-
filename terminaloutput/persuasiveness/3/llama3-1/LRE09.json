I'll do my best to translate it for you:\n\n\"You want me to come with you on a little tour? Imagine we're at the municipal pool, like the one where kids go to learn how to swim. It's winter, so it's heated. You dip your foot in the water and it feels great. But then you see the central heating unit belching out smoke. You're upset because they haven't turned it off yet. You ask what's the connection between the central heating and the pool? Well, if the central heating is running, it's to heat up the pool! I'm explaining.\n\nWhen we get home from work in the evening, we all turn on our heaters at once to meet the demand of the central heating plants. But when they're not needed, the air pollution increases and the cost of energy consumption goes up for industries to encourage them to reduce their consumption. So, I've decided to implement a system that doesn't heat up the pools during this period, but rather takes advantage of the nighttime hours when we sleep and consumption is low.\n\nThis little tour at the pool has made me hungry! Good thing I have a sweet tooth and love baking chocolate cake. It's my weakness, and I have a lot of recipes to choose from, so I've decided to test them out. I crack the eggs, take out the flour and sugar, mix it all up, melt the chocolate... after several tries, I finally find the perfect recipe! You'll hear about it.\n\nMy work on this thesis is like baking cake. I'm searching for the right recipe - a model that will allow me to calculate the water temperature. To do that, I need the right ingredients: air temperature, wind speed, humidity, and the number of bathers. At the same time, I'll be taking measurements at an operational pool and comparing them with my calculated results. When I find the best model, I can then determine when to heat up the pools and reduce energy consumption.\n\nEveryone will be happy! And when I'm done... \"\n\nI hope that helps!","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,14465,9189,30714,409,96586,9952,41091,5019,20028,653,46110,7364,13,38891,89,9189,12584,89,3869,1208,68468,483,20188,1604,11,1370,51173,73103,39723,82133,3625,60404,9952,326,31769,56745,5019,917,9484,265,3869,308,1435,13,356,17771,326,39982,1553,11,27549,1826,74817,8047,13,41621,18659,41059,514,44630,7010,326,93847,13,46408,1826,51651,13,3489,301,514,7970,383,324,9189,628,647,261,665,3460,519,11,9189,39904,89,77558,1208,2960,46140,30945,2428,8065,9314,11206,13,1252,25500,11148,425,409,282,372,8047,3460,409,1208,88768,8047,13,41621,62299,665,1400,12339,1841,27549,308,17771,44093,6502,81682,8047,13,41621,7631,10333,26077,1826,514,55520,9465,1208,2960,46140,30945,2428,1880,1208,68468,483,30,61651,14707,11,4502,1208,2960,46140,30945,2428,34501,818,11,272,17771,5019,13826,2084,1208,68468,483,13,14465,296,6,30992,2428,13,3489,438,389,8175,265,514,57992,3930,42775,11,389,1437,29097,26725,665,27584,27138,1208,296,2227,635,5019,75871,265,3869,1208,62163,951,2960,969,645,30945,8467,7230,84,15844,15132,682,372,14014,11,10071,28463,514,38847,951,1615,20372,811,1826,4046,3532,978,5019,3625,67965,2053,5019,3625,3709,2058,3869,48416,8977,28130,1615,20372,367,13,622,34155,39587,7591,21200,978,409,48021,665,2035,653,72601,7930,29557,409,841,6502,13826,2084,3625,68468,1572,10878,519,20662,84411,536,11,10071,8065,32150,556,409,2848,2058,951,84411,2601,93101,399,288,39723,326,54386,53534,1880,39723,1208,1615,20372,367,1826,2267,1260,13,24703,46110,7364,7010,1208,68468,483,9189,264,1922,355,978,326,53149,10515,275,13,64105,64,10390,1395,14707,13,14465,9189,22114,7010,7643,36105,11,503,34155,6233,648,409,20028,653,342,69628,2933,8065,72476,266,13,356,17771,1647,64032,75117,296,62799,11,10071,503,34155,6502,8811,409,1421,47003,1880,4864,841,63762,6502,21965,1208,88265,90194,13,622,34155,7591,21200,978,409,3625,38211,13,14465,4865,325,3625,99225,88183,13,14465,35456,82,1208,3117,483,11,514,924,846,11,4864,296,19010,853,11,4864,66517,21901,265,514,72476,266,13,14465,757,282,788,42138,51854,4043,2852,5310,42827,13,622,34155,100162,514,342,69628,2933,86966,13,41621,296,41901,13510,89,951,80080,13,3206,42775,5019,1208,270,4558,325,11,272,17771,653,28800,22299,1208,281,64272,285,62243,13,14465,52571,1208,51651,1421,6672,13,24703,7930,296,55624,978,22550,11,3846,308,17771,6502,514,342,69628,2933,11,10071,1208,2798,14081,1598,409,326,93847,409,1208,68468,483,13,5034,1421,6672,1826,514,83597,1744,4864,52571,3869,7591,23827,261,1880,7930,757,29557,2221,409,5935,261,1208,2798,14081,1598,409,326,93847,13,27058,45602,11,503,6,4202,2192,63669,951,82134,81336,15433,4167,11,2798,14081,1598,409,326,6,1334,11,2798,76743,348,87960,3930,10594,11,67038,13109,409,326,6,1334,6033,35597,514,13026,409,293,4201,38647,13,2998,1370,543,51453,11,4864,59157,1082,951,11083,1439,1765,6316,68468,483,665,40761,13,14465,94297,45575,93455,1208,2798,14081,1598,11,11083,7889,1880,1208,93455,11,1208,2798,14081,1598,5935,8047,3846,7930,757,29557,409,7591,23827,261,514,49348,83597,13,3489,438,4864,326,26248,547,11,4864,94297,45575,46524,514,4545,887,63497,5019,13826,2084,3625,22253,1354,1880,4864,5213,6364,1370,1208,27584,13,14465,5213,6364,409,3846,48416,28674,44351,326,6,58400,11,514,1080,60768,294,6,69331,7709,1880,1370,1208,27584,13402,11,326,6,58400,1765,326,41901,2842,40280,13,80905,514,38900,1826,2262,13,19421,42676,503,6,4202,2852,1913,72,1131,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,50189,323,11782,1648,311,10552,701,17850,990,0,358,3358,656,856,1888,311,15025,433,369,499,1473,22336,1390,757,311,2586,449,499,389,264,2697,7364,30,38891,584,2351,520,279,27512,7463,11,1093,279,832,1405,6980,733,311,4048,1268,311,16587,13,1102,596,12688,11,779,433,596,32813,13,1472,24522,701,4579,304,279,3090,323,433,11321,2294,13,2030,1243,499,1518,279,8792,24494,5089,1689,28075,704,16603,13,1472,2351,23268,1606,814,9167,956,6656,433,1022,3686,13,1472,2610,1148,596,279,3717,1990,279,8792,24494,323,279,7463,30,8489,11,422,279,8792,24494,374,4401,11,433,596,311,8798,709,279,7463,0,358,2846,26073,627,198,4599,584,636,2162,505,990,304,279,11714,11,584,682,2543,389,1057,82467,520,3131,311,3449,279,7631,315,279,8792,24494,11012,13,2030,994,814,2351,539,4460,11,279,3805,25793,12992,323,279,2853,315,4907,15652,5900,709,369,19647,311,15253,1124,311,8108,872,15652,13,2100,11,358,3077,6773,311,4305,264,1887,430,3250,956,8798,709,279,34239,2391,420,4261,11,719,4856,5097,9610,315,279,93744,4207,994,584,6212,323,15652,374,3428,627,198,2028,2697,7364,520,279,7463,706,1903,757,30056,0,7839,3245,358,617,264,10437,26588,323,3021,28915,18414,19692,13,1102,596,856,23948,11,323,358,617,264,2763,315,19141,311,5268,505,11,779,358,3077,6773,311,1296,1124,704,13,358,17944,279,19335,11,1935,704,279,20415,323,13465,11,6651,433,682,709,11,30099,279,18414,1131,1306,3892,16696,11,358,5616,1505,279,4832,11363,0,1472,3358,6865,922,433,627,198,5159,990,389,420,17850,374,1093,28915,19692,13,358,2846,15389,36
