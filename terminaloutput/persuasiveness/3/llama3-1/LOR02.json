They use a specialized instrument to release gases from these rocks and compare them to the composition of the present-day air.\n\nThe fascinating part begins when they analyze the xenon gas in these rocks and find that it matches the composition of the xenon in deep-Earth rocks and meteorites, which is yellowish in color. However, the xenon in the present-day atmosphere has a different composition, more like greenish in color. This discrepancy leads to an intriguing search for an unknown \"blue\" component that could explain this difference.\n\nThe solution comes from data collected by the European Space Agency's Rosetta mission, which analyzed the composition of comets. The results show that the xenon in comets has a blueish tint. Therefore, the author concludes that Earth's atmosphere was initially yellowish in color, similar to the xenon in meteorites and deep-Earth rocks, but then received a \"blue\" contribution from cometary gases, resulting in its current greenish hue.\n\nThe passage is not only a fascinating scientific exploration but also a beautiful example of how poetic language can be used to explain complex concepts. The author's use of color analogies (\"yellow\", \"red\", \"blue\") and vivid descriptions (\"raviver ses couleurs\" - reviving the colors) makes the topic accessible and engaging, even for non-experts.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,5034,10335,265,1826,5016,8065,19910,3930,72601,2092,12267,13,12103,14036,764,12339,11,1208,30179,768,294,6,511,978,598,1880,409,17536,3869,829,7479,3381,294,80720,6316,824,273,9024,13,34447,294,94572,15273,3355,89810,27750,56086,1744,17317,33515,2439,1880,7930,14848,17634,84,29449,3197,66522,14464,481,949,33150,9511,67763,11,503,34155,3869,7643,46096,6316,4526,409,938,8696,11741,977,4014,417,11,18916,28674,951,36252,978,269,3695,11,951,4046,11943,484,2439,33073,17724,123537,5512,951,25664,36250,11,6033,35597,951,2211,484,41670,4046,585,5512,41199,1208,7479,409,21725,13,19421,41091,11,4864,3625,7591,376,9425,11,665,3625,74817,519,55398,81991,3625,21901,265,5019,3127,52424,3625,56086,11741,977,4014,417,1744,27750,938,8696,687,72,89810,13,3959,56086,1744,503,6,44803,325,76826,1880,1744,4864,9616,3869,1208,18528,409,326,6,1334,9049,5485,13,12623,51625,285,42625,11,503,6,44803,325,1208,12223,294,22827,56086,9024,11,514,865,978,6414,11,653,11917,324,887,63497,5019,77807,5615,466,1765,326,6,4775,483,409,326,6,266,8801,764,12339,13,3206,719,11,272,17771,39587,409,7591,23827,261,26077,955,409,938,8696,11741,977,4014,417,14848,18757,1469,90332,1765,10335,265,3625,56086,7930,17317,1218,283,8135,75804,88253,13,2998,21134,39381,11,503,34155,22209,978,514,865,978,6414,76354,7010,3625,938,8696,951,2848,17675,1759,409,1208,10335,265,1880,7930,1323,53377,3869,1208,7479,665,3460,519,1370,3625,4499,66,598,13,16233,18528,1826,3608,2428,3869,73103,3930,865,978,6414,991,652,3416,52235,7010,3625,36252,978,269,3695,13,77533,258,2439,1370,51173,1744,3846,865,978,6414,409,1208,10335,265,1880,951,36252,978,269,3695,45441,409,76651,12203,2957,13,13789,11,1647,80259,11,272,17771,1744,514,865,978,6414,57485,7010,326,6,1334,11,1744,17317,33515,2439,11,66090,409,326,6,266,8801,764,12339,11,308,26248,6502,1208,27584,18528,13,356,17771,22299,4502,11,8065,39381,294,93825,12203,2957,11,3900,43989,409,76651,67861,13,2582,11,42676,4864,1239,42441,1765,7643,27404,409,1069,396,554,11,7930,71925,6960,1208,4526,409,36252,978,269,3695,11,4864,100164,3930,12203,2957,11,4864,100164,27584,3930,85059,11,7930,8024,8065,56086,4046,34965,1370,514,13612,321,13,34447,503,34155,72006,6669,10670,26725,3625,32118,5317,288,2278,21041,11,3900,757,893,593,52842,42625,6316,15119,1557,409,12704,84,5019,3327,72684,20662,76651,67861,3930,865,978,6414,294,6,266,8801,764,12339,13,2998,220,1049,19,11,326,6,351,768,63983,20487,95199,26193,264,60630,978,6316,4538,451,9859,76,8047,16870,27625,5019,48908,665,5589,958,299,1414,6316,47838,8415,97193,409,5634,59307,11741,977,4014,417,13,11876,470,4558,2392,11,27750,30870,645,409,2840,580,1880,409,17258,784,20712,11,2800,14014,3197,447,14014,8065,1913,21901,3930,72601,2092,12267,41199,1208,85434,951,27138,13,362,39002,409,20662,4538,451,63983,20487,513,26483,85,1339,514,27584,14473,1744,66090,1744,503,49963,1082,3869,35336,5019,8678,805,514,865,978,6414,13,5767,17154,220,679,21,11,514,36543,18111,15878,76190,13,8242,29449,27404,409,1069,396,554,11,17317,57038,6316,4538,451,7930,1826,25945,36897,13,62293,20662,27404,409,1069,396,554,6669,68976,11,514,865,978,6414,951,470,4558,2392,44521,1339,6316,18528,12704,361,13,9648,55755,22011,11,1208,10335,265,11,1376,8047,409,5634,59307,92892,17724,10253,36252,978,269,3695,11,264,14707,15925,6316,14036,764,12339,3003,20487,409,76651,12203,2957,13,34447,3900,4498,1339,379,26514,2743,45889,281,2910,14014,62197,1924,409,12704,84,470,978,71237,5019,64290,404,829,18528,1180,31037,11,7930,296,41901,40142,20272,46131,951,5309,288,1880,951,6502,296,30872,417,13,5034,10335,265,1826,39587,5016,11,294,6,21068,359,834,593,27549,841,893,593,6502,294,6,1334,13,7695,8657,285,1339,409,43643,1553,15907,4020,77660,13,27058,85877,408,265,326,6,266,8801,764,12339,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,50189,323,76534,21765,4999,198,791,3229,374,264,32185,889,7978,279,6371,315,9420,596,16975,555,42118,11741,977,53686,23902,11,1778,439,42142,3695,11,18266,10688,505,279,36250,25664,11,323,82128,23902,13,2435,1005,264,28175,14473,311,4984,45612,505,1521,23902,323,9616,1124,311,279,18528,315,279,3118,11477,3805,627,198,791,27387,961,12302,994,814,24564,279,53265,263,6962,304,1521,23902,323,1505,430,433,9248,279,18528,315,279,53265,263,304,5655,13737,47601,23902,323,42142,3695,11,902,374,14071,819,304,1933,13,4452,11,279,53265,263,304,279,3118,11477,16975,706,264,2204,18528,11,810,1093,6307,819,304,1933,13,1115,79105,11767,311,459,41765,2778,369,459,9987,330,12481,1,3777,430,1436,10552,420,6811,627,198,791,6425,4131,505,828,14890,555,279,7665,11746,16784,596,16870,27625,9131,11,902,30239,279,18528,315,470,1441,13,578,3135,1501,430,279,53265,263,304,470,1441,706,264,6437,819,49104,13,15636,11,279,3229,45537,430,9420,596,16975,574,15453,14071,819,304,1933,11,4528,311,279,53265,263,304,42142,3695,323,5655,13737,47601,23902,11,719,1243,4036,264,330,12481,1,19035,505,470,16238,45612,11,13239,304,12
