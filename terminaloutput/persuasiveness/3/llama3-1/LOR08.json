She seems puzzled and unsure of what to say, which is understandable given the complexity of evaluating the state of a forest.\n\nShe mentions that scientists have trouble determining whether a forest is healthy or not, as just measuring the absence of degradation isn't enough. That's why she wants to understand how the forest functions from an ecological perspective.\n\nThe journalist then shares her research experience, studying ecosystems and biodiversity in forests with her colleagues. They're trying to build indicators to track the ecological state of these systems. She mentions some interesting findings, such as the importance of dead wood in enriching soils and the need for a certain amount of forest area to develop optimally.\n\nThe broadcast takes a turn when she talks about climate change, citing research that shows its impact on plants, but notes that there's still limited understanding of its effects on ecosystems. She shares some surprising results from her thesis, including the finding that 11% of mountainous ecosystems have already shifted towards warmer climates than before.\n\nFinally, she mentions the various threats facing forests, such as soil compaction and invasive exotic species, and wonders if the measures being taken to protect them are effective. She plans to compare protected forests with unprotected ones to see what works best.\n\nOverall, this broadcast is a great example of science communication in action!","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,3436,30854,36731,665,2167,409,9757,8511,901,2933,60630,978,76305,5019,97166,326,57286,266,409,20662,369,49530,13,1708,1105,12155,369,5615,2641,42437,22626,82133,84568,14707,13,29124,66,2182,89,11,4864,100164,409,1208,296,46651,11,951,35641,625,2439,11,951,23962,11,951,82711,31355,11,16968,39043,296,6,326,6,1334,294,6,14283,6502,21965,8811,43584,62408,8486,17194,841,829,275,6502,75249,13510,13,356,17771,4725,5019,326,52152,4811,13,11876,7330,333,8467,14848,48488,409,8811,3869,47929,4502,6316,369,49530,11412,14707,6033,6502,13,81245,11427,306,665,48901,4046,838,8977,3625,3026,2492,7930,281,12416,306,1765,27549,1880,3625,7591,70,9011,2641,1744,45602,25692,20028,1345,2852,1370,45973,11,5019,68226,13510,1744,16968,11412,14707,11,326,6,3518,768,409,7591,49241,841,8657,275,6502,13,356,17771,87320,4864,5320,2249,60946,265,4068,1208,369,49530,34501,818,5019,4046,838,8977,4538,14240,266,294,22827,1486,409,48234,91329,1640,2428,13,34447,514,80259,11,272,17771,934,54386,841,25692,6502,25400,7631,261,11,45575,4068,1744,272,17771,3846,5634,258,30,74656,6033,14707,1208,67628,11,3625,92622,66304,11,3625,9259,13,19421,5019,61512,39043,20272,220,605,8261,1744,503,6,2706,81356,14707,25400,1153,261,1208,3488,13,13789,11,4864,841,36731,39040,339,4558,325,41199,16968,3846,27138,11,10071,41199,220,605,8261,11,9952,11083,4631,4558,70,1157,11,17317,14240,664,919,3625,4046,9594,599,66474,13952,4918,1880,28130,56594,1986,13109,5019,19477,52750,951,13519,1759,409,924,33920,409,28130,14240,266,91329,1640,2428,13,1952,513,62163,11,1370,51173,11,409,74940,7479,6316,369,49530,264,63669,5019,513,52895,716,409,85722,7706,1604,6033,35597,1208,10484,13109,409,66304,10237,100243,5019,2018,8977,3869,31518,404,3625,2092,82,13,34447,3663,8065,893,593,409,390,46302,11,3900,379,264,45889,65838,11,389,274,17771,259,3514,978,5553,1208,38317,13,4418,66,11,9952,514,65827,3675,409,1647,4046,61673,11,503,34155,59062,978,6316,270,4558,325,7010,1208,88265,4864,757,17477,26633,4860,13,5034,55133,3613,68495,514,9517,6583,1386,1133,11323,266,2428,13,11876,7330,333,8467,14848,7591,1677,376,978,4538,5536,1765,3625,6136,288,11,10071,389,893,593,35597,409,100246,1765,3625,4046,9594,599,66474,13,622,34155,39587,24560,23008,9211,951,2606,4918,409,79415,5512,409,6136,288,86595,5512,1765,5636,294,22827,97739,9326,1880,4864,3625,16796,51010,28111,5512,7010,6316,25945,25626,2385,409,46681,13,622,41901,16796,7591,47348,3625,4595,409,369,5615,2641,7010,3625,447,2053,46152,84764,1188,24560,86595,5512,13,19421,503,34155,18757,48021,665,4046,28580,1744,46939,665,20605,24812,11,220,806,1034,951,4046,9594,599,66474,13952,4918,14848,4046,12821,96559,5553,951,7625,53819,5636,70412,82,934,49152,519,13,220,806,4,272,17771,653,30870,273,4550,479,46939,77554,14081,481,13,19421,1370,543,4558,1001,3869,39043,11,294,81979,3026,2492,84764,1188,24560,3608,13215,14014,41199,1317,67380,11,22299,1370,51173,514,259,13559,479,951,2092,82,6033,35597,3625,16948,4558,1634,506,354,8467,6233,1494,1056,15844,13,356,17771,87320,11,41199,3625,65838,220,1954,11,326,48968,4176,17317,21559,951,1665,22589,1880,3625,52138,729,294,6,351,404,13,11876,13952,4918,2322,73468,39587,665,2035,951,6299,1765,514,25911,5019,1760,978,1414,1208,369,49530,1880,829,56594,1986,13109,13,34447,1913,54960,11,1826,54312,1744,39043,15572,68,39043,30,356,17771,1208,26633,90272,3488,1744,4864,757,17477,13,9589,54312,1744,3625,3435,8467,78511,14295,665,282,525,324,409,1208,17332,11159,13109,15132,31914,2492,30,9589,54312,1744,12155,9045,15132,8657,285,1821,30,27058,39043,4864,91507,93455,3625,369,5615,2641,7930,15132,1760,19395,14014,9952,19637,645,7930,514,15132,1069,21719,11,66021,1744,11,8065,1620,11,29449,1665,333,308,17771,6502,71357,409,47929,4068,82133,3625,369,5615,2641,13,19421,39043,11,39043,308,17771,934,31109,14240,2070,13,5034,1620,13109,11,272,17771,934,6,37907,779,1188,665,7970,14240,266,13,14465,15119,1557,3930,66304,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,50189,9063,13195,4999,198,791,23672,374,13122,3974,505,9757,8511,901,2933,13952,11,4560,311,7216,704,422,279,8753,36658,527,3815,1664,477,539,13,3005,5084,87420,323,44003,315,1148,311,2019,11,902,374,49839,2728,279,23965,315,38663,279,1614,315,264,13952,627,198,8100,34945,430,14248,617,12544,26679,3508,264,13952,374,9498,477,539,11,439,1120,30090,279,19821,315,53568,4536,956,3403,13,3011,596,3249,1364,6944,311,3619,1268,279,13952,5865,505,459,50953,13356,627,198,791,23672,1243,13551,1077,3495,3217,11,21630,61951,323,73119,304,36658,449,1077,18105,13,2435,2351,4560,311,1977,34824,311,3839,279,50953,1614,315,1521,6067,13,3005,34945,1063,7185,14955,11,1778,439,279,12939,315,5710,7732,304,31518,287,69561,323,279,1205,369,264,3738,3392,315,13952,3158,311,2274,7706,750,627,198,791,13195,5097,264,2543,994,1364,13739,922,10182,2349,11,33264,3495,430,5039,1202,5536,389,11012,11,719,8554,430,1070,596,2103,7347,8830,315,1202,6372,389,61951,13,3005,13551,1063,
