The speaker appears to be discussing the importance of considering social factors in economic decisions, using examples such as the impact of environmental degradation on social well-being.\n\nSome key points made by the speaker include:\n\n* The need to consider social factors when making economic decisions\n* The importance of understanding the social impacts of economic activities, such as job creation and environmental degradation\n* The role of indicators in measuring the social impacts of economic activities\n* The need for a more integrated approach to economics and social development\n\nThe text also contains some humorous moments, such as when the speaker says \"C'est pas... c'est termin√©\" (which roughly translates to \"It's not... it's over\"), suggesting that they are aware that their message may be met with resistance or skepticism.\n\nOverall, the text appears to be a call to action for policymakers and business leaders to prioritize social development alongside economic growth.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,356,17771,514,45640,294,6,52,61492,325,11,4160,648,294,6,27887,68238,1744,4538,9859,1879,333,689,275,40351,409,25595,36077,11,3625,32116,7930,274,6,83336,306,77558,25400,1880,934,35329,8508,275,3625,7120,42138,3625,46106,13,19421,74699,326,31769,45317,648,75107,11,326,31769,65272,409,326,31769,45317,648,75107,11,272,17771,25945,3062,13,11876,18003,2191,288,409,326,31769,45317,648,75107,4046,12821,11942,25945,100198,1880,64898,11814,2700,2473,1208,19035,1765,326,31769,45317,648,75107,7010,326,6,31880,732,8458,76605,13510,1744,326,41901,2842,40280,294,6,2933,69572,88253,11,3900,308,17771,6502,7970,5019,3625,38847,12288,83391,1880,3625,38847,12288,83391,308,6,546,6502,48488,409,46681,5019,75831,653,50026,40280,8518,37849,13,356,8458,76605,13510,934,35329,308,17771,6502,3284,409,46524,1208,19035,13,64898,11814,2700,2473,1208,19035,409,326,31769,45317,648,75107,665,14240,41939,3625,20934,598,951,38847,1880,665,26483,77282,3625,13519,1759,5368,818,37291,27750,13519,1759,3073,306,11,4864,46524,2192,1208,19035,9465,3625,82653,552,65207,1880,3625,38847,13,19421,74699,11,87320,326,31769,45317,648,75107,30,7695,379,264,653,46415,11,3900,264,24560,1879,978,653,14902,9465,326,52374,5523,648,1880,1208,9822,13,356,8458,76605,13510,1208,59251,409,26725,3625,32592,71098,1354,7930,1022,8135,220,1041,8654,385,285,1765,220,605,65838,732,8458,76605,13510,28201,13,3489,17771,54312,7930,513,39904,30,38891,89,6316,82653,648,7930,31435,220,508,4,951,97263,65207,1880,45602,4790,21581,1339,7010,220,1272,4,6316,9517,23985,409,733,60768,7010,514,54206,1620,13,356,8458,76605,13510,6316,82653,648,25945,36897,1880,75332,3486,9833,1105,11,17317,23423,2439,1744,274,35329,379,264,6316,82653,648,75107,25945,36897,11,665,42587,519,27750,13519,1759,11,45602,17317,87885,1137,3869,326,6,5389,404,1880,3869,71751,6316,11376,9517,41546,4008,8047,951,7591,81,1924,82653,8467,1880,1131,272,17771,6502,1131,272,17771,10415,978,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5084,430,279,1495,374,264,36815,315,264,8982,477,15864,555,64898,11814,389,279,8712,315,8752,323,3674,4500,13,578,19114,8111,311,387,25394,279,12939,315,13126,3674,9547,304,7100,11429,11,1701,10507,1778,439,279,5536,315,12434,53568,389,3674,1664,33851,627,198,8538,1401,3585,1903,555,279,19114,2997,1473,9,578,1205,311,2980,3674,9547,994,3339,7100,11429,198,9,578,12939,315,8830,279,3674,25949,315,7100,7640,11,1778,439,2683,9886,323,12434,53568,198,9,578,3560,315,34824,304,30090,279,3674,25949,315,7100,7640,198,9,578,1205,369,264,810,18751,5603,311,28989,323,3674,4500,198,198,791,1495,1101,5727,1063,70946,14269,11,1778,439,994,279,19114,2795,330,34,6,478,6502,1131,272,17771,10415,978,1,320,8370,17715,48018,311,330,2181,596,539,1131,433,596,927,4063,23377,430,814,527,8010,430,872,1984,1253,387,2322,449,13957,477,67233,627,198,28589,11,279,1495,8111,311,387,264,1650,311,1957,369,70978,323,2626,6164,311,63652,3674,4500,16662,7100,6650,13,128009],"total_duration":6810871657,"load_duration":252107,"prompt_eval_count":394,"prompt_eval_duration":783985000,"eval_count":203,"eval_duration":6025998000}
