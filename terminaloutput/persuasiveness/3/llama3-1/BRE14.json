It seems that you were trying to explain your thesis to someone at a bar, and it didn't quite go as planned.\n\nTo summarize, your thesis is about the modernity and coloniality of our world, specifically in Argentina during the 19th century. You argue that there are two sides to the coin: the visible side represents progress, development, and emancipation, while the hidden side represents oppression, inferiorization, and domination of certain peoples. Your research explores how these mechanisms led to the physical elimination of some indigenous tribes and symbolic erasure of others in Argentina during the 19th century.\n\nYou tried to explain your thesis to someone at the bar, using an analogy about a coin with two sides. You showed that just as there are two sides to the coin, modernity and coloniality are intertwined concepts. Your interlocutor seemed initially interested but eventually lost steam, asking why you chose to work on this topic.\n\nYou responded by explaining your motivations: you want to highlight the importance of understanding the historical roots of ongoing struggles faced by indigenous communities today. You hope that by examining the past, you can shed light on the current situation and inform future policies and actions.\n\nIt's an impressive effort, but it seems like your interlocutor wasn't entirely convinced or interested in the nuances of your research. Nonetheless, I'm sure it takes courage to share such complex ideas with someone who might not have a background in the field!\n\nWould you like to elaborate on any specific aspects of your thesis or the challenges you faced while researching and presenting it?","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,426,1116,11,503,34155,3327,76366,7643,270,4558,325,13,622,34155,24560,1046,3023,8047,8065,3703,11,653,75878,274,6,16082,1557,11,389,2624,1088,11,3900,757,62163,3846,1744,4864,66517,7010,1208,17536,13,19421,37572,11,9964,66517,75249,7010,1208,17536,949,14465,75871,82,1744,4864,66517,6316,270,4558,325,13,7695,757,1239,42441,11,4864,514,1239,42441,11,3900,757,1239,42441,11,4864,514,1239,42441,13,7695,305,5512,635,11,3900,1913,275,1370,757,7631,261,13,19421,27549,1826,1765,75249,11,9637,270,4558,325,949,14465,75871,82,11,1765,3625,1280,343,4558,4978,409,1208,393,23465,1880,409,1208,7281,6241,648,11,665,82822,13,7695,20272,80664,519,409,274,55624,978,676,261,11,3900,757,62163,951,51625,6948,11,3900,274,55624,978,22550,13,7777,11,4864,57625,4618,7010,7643,3273,1557,11,4864,274,1105,6316,70477,346,11,4864,757,86345,13,2998,20272,11,3625,2624,2530,1765,514,463,911,12416,11,514,82620,11,326,6,17060,1149,49686,15132,22299,514,81337,27402,409,1208,70477,346,11,3846,934,54386,11412,917,8023,1208,6617,13109,13,356,17771,3846,1744,326,54386,17317,20605,265,11,3846,1744,326,54386,4160,275,33670,16968,13,34447,3900,29253,52842,42625,514,5553,519,409,20662,70477,346,11,1744,9964,3567,1572,11,10071,7930,308,17771,6502,9621,7010,326,6,12828,978,8747,266,13,62408,3663,61387,8047,71925,6960,326,6,454,4099,11,326,6,13885,978,3334,8082,11,1208,55949,409,76076,1069,29423,11,3846,934,54386,11412,917,8023,1208,37683,13109,13,1611,85722,13509,1604,11,20662,70477,346,7891,1082,514,38900,1880,829,1515,2428,409,34501,40280,13,7695,841,25692,379,39929,409,6617,13109,15878,37683,13109,13,65381,31632,409,3846,20272,11,41091,11,503,6,44803,325,3625,32118,4919,2191,288,409,20662,1515,2428,2033,7010,514,719,409,60946,265,4068,1208,6617,13109,264,5293,978,3869,326,31769,4763,2617,64441,409,3738,288,14121,355,1880,326,31769,4763,2617,7891,2428,951,46106,665,82822,8065,220,777,68,97739,9326,13,7695,296,6,20243,2182,11,3900,841,296,6,20243,2182,6502,13,328,35329,296,6,20243,2182,11,4864,3136,13,2998,51092,11,3846,7930,296,55624,978,22550,7010,1208,26633,90272,48901,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,3846,15132,3625,78167,409,1208,7829,1180,31037,13,622,6,49133,4068,3625,99225,12328,417,3930,220,777,68,97739,9326,7930,7591,5192,81541,3625,1280,343,4558,4978,14848,4790,3159,27750,26633,12580,13,2998,20272,11,503,6,26577,648,294,6,16288,6316,85722,294,31769,68019,77580,15235,20487,13,3959,78199,11,951,270,66474,11,951,12678,409,1742,11,951,15082,11,951,77617,3946,15473,778,14014,11,951,5554,2436,7930,5891,72,89810,51854,37291,7010,1647,43194,1880,7930,15132,57705,978,2889,8467,409,20662,1515,2428,1744,503,34155,7591,5589,648,665,55133,48901,13,7695,20272,653,13033,68,11,503,6,1138,37093,4272,11,3900,35456,653,3805,824,698,8536,13,7695,757,62163,87320,503,34155,2665,13532,409,58673,15610,1765,3846,70927,13,14465,75871,82,13,622,34155,55162,10036,48021,665,41263,20712,1208,6617,13109,1880,1208,37683,13109,409,29449,38900,7010,514,719,409,9517,1517,978,331,404,1765,3625,1615,978,45045,3435,8467,1880,3608,275,17724,2995,408,81,14014,1370,3625,2624,2530,294,1220,6617,288,55398,81991,12155,49301,13,2009,39474,409,326,6,715,52,2515,96559,665,220,679,17,61158,6853,1744,17317,308,41901,57038,6502,1913,72,9952,1208,9349,42345,978,8637,2428,11,1208,9517,4099,1880,1208,21934,64956,8047,45973,3625,1069,29423,18050,22589,13,2009,719,409,7643,270,4558,325,1826,1913,54960,409,23008,9211,45889,9517,23475,7010,514,81621,5019,64972,60946,265,1208,6671,1180,31037,409,27750,34561,2784,5512,11,7930,326,21493,306,44093,11,26633,97739,19153,42138,11,5019,20028,5201,261,43153,97222,3663,8065,85182,40280,1880,10253,2814,2617,3916,13,7695,757,1239,42441,11,4864,514,1239,42441,11,3900,757,1239,42441,11,4864,514,1239,42441,11,3900,22011,12769,16770,6033,2852,11,92759,519,13,1252,47838,2807,265,949,8345,426,1116,11,503,34155,9071,978,294,6,30992,72684,7643,270,4558,325,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,27387,3446,0,1102,5084,430,499,1051,4560,311,10552,701,17850,311,4423,520,264,3703,11,323,433,3287,956,5115,733,439,13205,627,198,1271,63179,11,701,17850,374,922,279,6617,488,323,37683,488,315,1057,1917,11,11951,304,32164,2391,279,220,777,339,9478,13,1472,18046,430,1070,527,1403,11314,311,279,16652,25,279,9621,3185,11105,5208,11,4500,11,323,91225,49686,11,1418,279,8340,3185,11105,47748,11,38279,2065,11,323,55949,315,3738,32538,13,4718,3495,41424,1268,1521,24717,6197,311,279,7106,44032,315,1063,39678,39503,323,36396,2781,4058,315,3885,304,32164,2391,279,220,777,339,9478,627,198,2675,6818,311,10552,701,17850,311,4423,520,279,3703,11,1701,459,56203,922,264,16652,449,1403,11314,13,1472,8710,430,1120,439,1070,527,1403,11314,311,279,16652,11,6617,488,323,37683,488,527,99892,19476,13,4718,958,1092,4936,9508,15453,8173,719,9778,5675,20930,11,10371,3249,499,14896,311,990,389,420,8712,627,198,2675,16846,555,26073,701,65931,25,499,1390,311,11415,279,12939,315,8830,279,13970,20282,315
