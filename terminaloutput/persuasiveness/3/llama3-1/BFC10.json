You're telling the story of a fantastical industrial territory, 500 years after the destruction of the ring. The Comté has undergone the Industrial Revolution and is now facing difficulties in its industry, which is heavily dependent on energy production.\n\nThe situation is quite problematic, as the energy sector is dominated by two powerful figures: Alstorm the magician and General Electrician. These individuals are more interested in other regions than the Comté itself. The energy sector has changed dramatically, and competition is fierce. This has led to a series of negative consequences, including magicians leaving, breweries closing, and hobbits struggling to find work.\n\nTo make matters worse, these difficulties reinforce one another, creating a vicious cycle. So, how can the Comté escape this predicament? As an economist, I would suggest that diversifying its economy could be a key solution. However, this is where things get complicated. The Comté has a strong industrial heritage, and its hobbits have extremely specialized skills. This makes it challenging for the territory to pivot and change direction.\n\nI aim to understand which factors are hindering the Comté's ability to diversify its economy and which ones could help it shift course. To do this, I will first conduct a statistical cartography of the territory to gain a global understanding of its difficulties and blockages. Once I have this vision, I plan to study the strengths and resources of the Comté by conducting interviews with hobbits. This will allow me to observe how they take charge of their own destiny.\n\nI also want to examine the local \"Fellowship of the Ring\" community, composed of captains of industry, elected officials, citizens, and trade unions, which is united around common projects and public policies. My goal is to understand how this community functions, who its members are, what relationships they have with one another, and whether their public policies allow them to engage the territory in a new scenario.\n\nWhat a fascinating project!","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,362,9832,77492,88253,11,5019,9189,3327,72684,514,70927,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,91507,9189,15473,444,466,326,6,90446,64979,2428,294,22827,7317,6491,556,9047,22811,13,38891,89,1208,1219,123708,11,220,2636,8261,42138,1208,19814,409,326,6,20991,2933,13,4241,9425,11,3846,7317,6491,556,264,4635,84,1208,9517,65272,67965,6853,1880,74699,11,3625,5107,5512,409,326,6,485,592,7379,13,19421,272,17771,25945,52088,978,8637,2428,11,66021,1744,1120,1133,11,1208,1219,123708,1826,7591,3825,5048,409,326,6,485,592,7379,13,27058,23761,5636,51625,1082,11,1208,1219,123708,1826,1180,77776,11358,8047,1370,326,6,485,592,7379,409,326,31769,64374,1880,20662,9047,7379,1826,17576,8047,9465,3625,69236,3930,4983,3457,268,1708,27511,1880,3930,89175,98151,34395,11,26633,513,19388,1759,96308,92759,5512,1370,294,81979,38682,919,13,328,5757,412,1744,514,31237,12844,409,326,31769,64374,264,14707,2609,978,1880,1744,1208,3613,21201,1826,409,7287,17936,13,2009,5945,5979,11,272,17771,1744,27750,5107,5512,83786,25108,77,306,43905,6316,47528,294,81979,52088,66474,13,3959,4983,3457,729,7930,961,306,11,951,37138,4804,7930,68736,11,5636,79380,409,42775,5019,3625,69176,11777,13,2998,5636,11,26725,27750,33013,98942,308,19395,266,22589,513,5790,2000,1189,9465,84440,13,65381,31632,409,39015,11,4068,389,20272,5019,3460,404,3930,47562,273,32531,53819,949,445,31769,45317,17194,665,41091,11412,9189,13510,934,31109,48901,409,1208,6425,11,272,17771,1744,1208,1219,123708,71451,409,87325,31237,38647,3869,52895,716,1880,934,85217,25400,29557,73468,409,1375,11967,4538,82653,648,665,1208,21797,84554,13,34447,272,17771,39015,1744,39043,1080,1736,13,1611,326,414,5469,2793,15760,1392,1522,5512,11,6316,32118,97495,67965,6853,65058,11,951,69176,11777,10253,75332,2436,17508,76305,285,14014,11,39043,20272,1744,1208,16578,3930,48876,1826,4684,5118,8047,13,9648,55755,22011,11,1208,1219,123708,1826,14545,447,8047,7010,653,1156,10610,3370,13,1252,1156,10610,3370,7930,43989,47838,86633,20940,333,11,10071,7930,75804,88253,4751,483,7010,653,11957,6953,1355,582,13,6178,72,11,4864,5320,2249,60946,265,934,2053,15132,3625,33013,98942,7930,8654,5615,331,306,1208,1219,123708,409,21797,3125,4538,4197,13109,11,1880,3625,33013,98942,7930,11,8065,32150,556,11,5019,969,1188,326,26248,1814,3869,62439,409,9781,585,42827,13,27058,39043,11,4864,91507,294,6,370,541,1200,52424,653,15439,3930,7317,6491,556,77433,3869,6316,7558,3257,648,20719,2428,13,34447,4160,321,6496,11,6316,37291,934,54386,264,6316,11376,13509,1604,951,5107,5512,1880,951,41840,1154,3930,7317,6491,556,11,934,17771,54312,934,54386,20272,949,27058,75871,265,3869,20662,3488,11,4864,91507,14240,664,1291,3625,520,11934,1880,594,40751,409,1208,1219,123708,665,3026,519,951,1218,2171,80463,98544,81,12416,951,69176,11777,13,24703,7930,11412,757,29557,10367,294,6,31830,4068,46152,864,7521,306,28130,52087,665,1925,13,4366,346,1744,11,97507,11,3625,69176,11777,864,7521,306,28130,52087,665,1925,13,7695,47090,47929,934,35329,29253,6316,34561,94943,409,326,6,20991,2933,2254,11,40321,8047,409,61510,33903,294,6,485,592,7379,11,33013,355,11,6681,2303,729,1880,22013,292,1900,11,1880,9517,359,285,90053,409,22040,1441,1081,11099,11,951,3435,8467,78511,14295,13,3206,719,11,272,17771,409,60946,265,4068,20662,34561,94943,34501,818,11,7930,665,15132,15907,78957,11,26077,645,15132,43153,4398,9465,84440,11,1880,4502,3625,3435,8467,78511,14295,934,85217,2322,73468,665,2035,29557,73468,294,6,833,1435,514,7317,6491,556,7010,653,43453,1156,10610,3370,13,1252,25945,72006,1156,10610,3370,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,459,41765,8712,0,1472,2351,11890,279,3446,315,264,64979,950,13076,18455,11,220,2636,1667,1306,279,19814,315,279,10264,13,578,1219,123708,706,64238,279,25563,22910,323,374,1457,13176,27129,304,1202,5064,11,902,374,17345,18222,389,4907,5788,627,198,791,6671,374,5115,36033,11,439,279,4907,10706,374,30801,555,1403,8147,12678,25,1708,27511,279,90441,323,3331,21246,1122,13,4314,7931,527,810,8173,304,1023,13918,1109,279,1219,123708,5196,13,578,4907,10706,706,5614,29057,11,323,10937,374,42442,13,1115,706,6197,311,264,4101,315,8389,16296,11,2737,4983,9818,9564,11,73802,15676,11,323,69176,11777,20558,311,1505,990,627,198,1271,1304,13146,11201,11,1521,27129,55414,832,2500,11,6968,264,43510,11008,13,2100,11,1268,649,279,1219,123708,12731,420,79434,2908,30,1666,459,46215,11,358,1053,4284,430,21797,7922,1202,8752,1436,387,264,1401,6425,13,4452,11,420,374,1405,2574,636,17395,13,578,1219,123708,706,264,3831,13076,28948,11,323,1202,69176,11777,617,9193,28175,7512,13,1115,3727,433,17436,369,279,18455,311,27137,323,2349,5216,627,198,40,9395,311,3619,902,9547,527,48419,4776,279,1219,123708,596,5845,311,21797,1463,1202,8752,323,902,6305,1436,1520,433,6541,3388,13,2057,656,420,11,358,690,1176,6929,264,29564,7558,5814,315,279,18455,311,8895,264,3728,8830,315,1202,27129,323,2565,1154,13,9843,358,617,420,11376,11,358,3197,311,4007,279,36486,323,50
