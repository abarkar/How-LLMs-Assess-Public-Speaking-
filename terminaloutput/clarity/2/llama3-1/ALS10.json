The speaker, who is an anthropologist, is discussing their research and experiences working with the Tibetan people in the Himalayas.\n\nThe speaker begins by comparing their work to a TV show called \"Rendez-vous en terre inconnue\" (which translates to \"Meeting on Unknown Land\"), where a celebrity immerses themselves in the daily life of a distant population. The anthropologist notes that while their work is not televised, it does involve immersing oneself in a foreign culture and way of life.\n\nThe speaker shares their personal experiences living with a Tibetan family in the Himalayas for several months, learning their language, drinking tea with them, and laughing together. They used the method of \"participatory observation,\" where they built trust with the locals and gained honest insights into their lives.\n\nHowever, the speaker also notes that initial interactions can be difficult. They recall having to learn to communicate effectively and earn the trust of the villagers.\n\nThe main focus of the speaker's research is on the evolution of traditional Tibetan medicine and how it has changed between generations. Specifically, they are studying the differences in practice between Yeshi, a traditional Tibetan doctor who learned from his father, and Norbu, his son who received training at a Tibetan medical school and has traveled to the West.\n\nThe speaker observes that there is an important intergenerational gap between Yeshi and Norbu. While Yeshi's knowledge was passed down through generations, Norbu's education and travel have exposed him to new ideas and practices. This has led to innovation in their traditional medicine, such as the development of new medicinal products and the sale of incense to tourists.\n\nThe speaker also notes that while life may be easier for the villagers today, there are concerns about the future of traditional practices and rituals. Yeshi, the father, is worried about who will take over his responsibilities and continue the family traditions when his son is away for part of the year.\n\nOverall, the speaker's work as an anthropologist involves immersing oneself in a foreign culture to understand how societies evolve and what makes us human.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,7695,379,264,6316,4046,2796,43116,7930,274,53149,6853,12769,432,73602,45325,665,88026,304,5259,361,8345,7010,1208,88265,6316,272,29982,32414,978,961,274,6,19519,1414,7010,1208,17536,294,31109,7187,781,396,8511,13,23126,729,11,39043,757,61158,6853,3846,1744,4864,66517,11,10071,1208,2373,2536,32118,8747,266,2428,11,326,6,32329,897,38469,13,445,6,32329,897,38469,274,55624,978,22550,665,67781,10253,96642,30811,65970,2854,33903,1880,17317,22114,3869,48021,665,13356,29449,83187,3941,409,17536,13,19421,41091,11,27549,1826,39723,7643,88026,304,5259,361,949,38891,89,11,409,38546,20605,3326,288,665,818,343,14014,11,653,14458,3869,220,1758,410,296,75104,294,6,99111,11,6316,7187,8065,436,556,51794,11,3869,1208,49361,5954,77,37093,11,65198,11,4160,556,272,287,75,5048,11,17317,74533,7010,653,14458,409,326,68070,2931,12874,13,356,17771,39015,1481,300,1744,503,34155,81621,56321,37291,11,51854,46415,11,3869,18434,265,665,75657,7010,6316,7187,294,6,4775,483,259,581,10515,8511,294,41901,2842,220,3101,14464,1821,13,622,34155,25160,9952,27750,47104,11,1048,951,2807,417,9952,27750,47104,11,44314,978,28130,96282,13,27058,62998,949,4366,346,1744,272,17771,1208,98652,409,38317,409,1647,96839,294,57286,29246,11,326,6,79060,5293,5048,13,1952,1370,273,9952,3625,47104,11,389,3625,2322,665,2389,5397,1880,46152,17317,7591,34667,8135,6316,49361,5954,77,37093,13,13789,11,4864,841,9189,6636,6502,1744,514,21134,3729,1826,653,28800,77411,13,14465,757,5945,10176,729,11,4864,9189,16796,665,5589,1448,680,978,3869,1208,60172,294,22827,14458,30148,42676,11,6502,409,90509,13,1252,47838,14458,30148,39904,1880,757,22011,11,665,20272,11,13088,6868,285,6853,11,3900,47090,5790,95920,11,3900,841,47090,6502,1448,3183,13,622,6,40997,11,503,6,1683,6091,7010,1208,36105,44526,20487,11,99309,20043,2249,436,51058,757,5363,306,294,22827,3805,37539,11067,13,1952,296,6,10543,68,1913,54960,11,389,757,113147,514,76680,1880,5636,503,41901,66304,11,5636,389,296,41901,594,805,265,13,14465,841,11427,2852,6502,4068,5790,95920,11,4864,841,63762,5636,4068,31632,13,34447,1913,54960,11,4864,36731,1370,7287,3869,18434,265,7010,20662,67628,7010,1208,88265,3900,379,264,26633,32118,8332,1354,259,581,10515,1771,11,816,4385,72,514,281,12339,1880,8170,20218,514,89672,11,7930,55744,5118,306,6316,32118,8332,483,409,28130,14135,259,581,10515,8511,13,19421,272,17771,39043,7930,296,55624,978,22550,13,62463,26633,32118,8332,1354,55744,5118,306,7010,28130,47276,1880,3381,43153,35030,292,24469,3869,2385,409,6136,288,10253,447,37907,46152,14848,1046,12416,13,19421,7643,270,4558,325,60172,1765,326,31769,65272,951,92096,409,3846,47929,35030,950,13,19421,1765,3846,7930,2349,9465,1208,95234,409,816,4385,72,11,514,281,12339,11,1880,409,8170,20218,11,514,89672,13,4418,66,934,17771,54312,1744,503,6,49133,949,622,6,49133,665,20272,653,26495,978,958,70,32453,2214,8301,3062,13,816,4385,72,11,514,281,12339,11,264,917,6091,8065,14458,9952,4538,281,12339,28463,13,1708,1105,1744,4538,89672,8170,20218,264,18757,48908,7010,6316,4046,56745,409,32118,8332,483,259,581,10515,8511,11,3900,264,15925,1046,12416,3869,653,47929,5636,3544,1880,3900,264,18757,23933,1435,665,20522,1748,13,19421,75804,88253,11,3900,45640,1880,3900,95234,409,5636,665,5636,665,20522,1748,13,7695,513,17302,68,3869,409,80080,58395,3930,38900,934,35329,39474,68,3869,4538,14458,13,24703,7930,20272,1744,829,14135,6301,1009,13,4418,66,3900,11412,1370,51173,11,20028,665,5636,409,15907,35030,292,24469,11,409,326,6,967,729,35030,292,992,934,35329,19189,10253,31070,288,409,21765,13,3489,301,593,14896,1744,4538,281,12339,308,26248,6502,3930,16968,917,43711,5979,978,8065,65385,11,10071,934,35329,264,4287,978,46110,3869,46110,13,435,2259,1001,11,816,4385,72,11,514,281,12339,11,757,22011,1744,97507,11,14707,97717,11,1208,17536,8065,14458,75804,88253,11,27549,1826,5636,51794,13,34447,3900,841,4160,275,5636,22299,33670,11,951,53542,1765,3625,3091,6723,2249,45740,414,404,1208,20605,24812,13,7695,513,62163,7930,1826,54312,7930,35456,969,829,16578,5019,2515,8977,3625,21889,61244,409,1709,14081,3416,4502,4538,89672,1826,79988,1208,4647,12583,978,409,326,6,85335,665,20272,13,4418,66,272,17771,39043,326,6,32329,897,38469,13,356,17771,22842,4068,4046,12821,361,6316,77824,13,356,17771,274,6,19519,1414,665,88026,304,5259,361,5019,60946,265,3846,7930,20272,409,17317,951,20183,45632,2854,1771,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2028,374,264,36815,315,459,7855,477,2835,14975,11,4461,505,264,18181,477,7274,13,578,19114,11,889,374,459,41416,16549,11,374,25394,872,3495,323,11704,3318,449,279,73074,1274,304,279,76438,98440,627,198,791,19114,12302,555,27393,872,990,311,264,6007,1501,2663,330,49,73602,45325,665,88026,304,5259,361,1,320,8370,48018,311,330,65676,389,22435,11680,4063,1405,264,31544,4998,388,288,5694,304,279,7446,2324,315,264,29827,7187,13,578,41416,16549,8554,430,1418,872,990,374,539,76710,11,433,1587,21736,4998,388,287,57669,304,264,7362,7829,323
