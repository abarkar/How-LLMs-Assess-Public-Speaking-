The speaker discusses the importance of urine as a valuable resource for agriculture and the need to shift away from linear, polluting systems towards circular ones.\n\nThe speaker starts by sharing a personal anecdote about their grand-grandmother's request to pee on rhubarb plants. This led them to explore the scientific aspects of human waste management and its impact on the environment. They highlight how urine is rich in nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, which are essential for plant growth.\n\nThe speaker then delves into the history of urban waste management, pointing out that in the 19th century, Parisians valued their urine as a fertilizer. However, with the rise of petrochemicals in the 20th century, synthetic fertilizers became widely used, and human waste was seen as useless.\n\nFast-forward to today, where most wastewater treatment plants only recover about 5% of nitrogen from urine, despite having the potential to produce 25 million baguettes of bread per day. The speaker argues that this is a missed opportunity, as a circular economy approach could valorize human waste and reduce the environmental impact of agriculture.\n\nThe speaker concludes by emphasizing the need for social, economic, and cultural changes to support a transition towards more sustainable practices. They suggest that even small actions, like using a toilet separation system or composting at home, can contribute to this shift.\n\nOverall, the speaker's presentation highlights the importance of urine as a valuable resource and encourages listeners to think creatively about circular economy solutions.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,2052,261,20028,24547,72,1765,1208,22408,45597,1395,13,29179,321,6496,3846,1744,7631,1339,7643,6800,1474,12339,3869,15907,86696,21430,69,1821,13,362,326,31769,5481,593,11,4864,308,6,4202,2852,56316,23423,978,1744,503,65948,2852,20028,409,1208,38317,1765,514,24547,72,13,19421,76776,11,4864,308,6,4202,2852,56316,43306,978,1744,1370,20662,95234,11,7643,6800,1474,12339,5899,1339,25692,85815,6316,951,1206,5512,409,1208,9320,91329,1640,2428,13,46706,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,14425,1082,3625,100246,409,96642,49255,7330,333,8467,5019,8678,805,1208,59471,951,3521,81,10515,919,2854,33903,13,80905,294,6,370,541,11,1208,4571,72,38469,3930,34922,2854,467,20605,265,1744,272,17771,1370,3625,4433,1572,1744,514,34922,51913,582,361,1208,3682,13109,951,10184,6417,812,11,326,6,1394,1295,951,1760,978,1572,11,3625,274,2053,1332,76743,2249,22299,514,33088,461,6033,514,62275,13,445,6,351,2298,316,648,11,27549,11,17317,20605,265,1744,3625,6136,288,513,46798,81,79738,1120,1133,409,27750,10184,6417,812,1880,1744,326,6,324,483,1826,653,9250,51155,2852,13,2998,5589,11,3625,7135,80463,20605,8135,934,81991,12366,11,8065,1630,5511,68,97739,9326,11,653,951,1665,22589,21901,2908,12249,409,1208,59471,951,3521,81,10515,919,2854,33903,43989,409,14448,12329,3625,4433,1572,5019,30870,566,261,3846,11008,951,10184,6417,812,13,19421,44829,11,8065,30388,68,97739,9326,11,1208,281,10515,299,331,318,648,1826,69003,8047,13,1952,274,17771,5906,3869,43998,10515,12329,951,51155,2852,38094,8467,3869,6800,5790,4057,294,6,67229,7063,65,1439,26495,3742,1880,3625,4433,1572,2854,33903,15132,409,46469,304,332,3742,13,4366,1208,27306,668,3869,523,13559,294,93847,1880,514,16968,3869,326,6,19395,412,11,389,3625,264,17004,5512,3869,1208,44229,20712,13,5034,60128,409,326,93847,951,436,33920,31539,1826,409,7287,35205,22761,2428,11,45575,389,264,1913,72,1370,19477,52750,951,603,1572,294,31769,79,2060,13,34447,665,18027,519,3625,384,12249,294,6,19395,412,11,27750,603,1572,841,1370,10176,89810,6502,3869,79196,52424,326,6,833,41098,12657,354,978,13,3489,6853,4824,53410,758,12095,389,14448,285,1339,326,6,324,483,409,26725,3625,14464,1821,409,326,6,351,6200,316,53301,41958,26584,5019,36214,12329,3930,1529,978,11,389,92215,2558,556,220,914,11990,409,9145,14127,2392,409,6784,1370,9880,13,19421,5019,61512,11,75804,88253,7010,20662,945,6200,316,53301,11,514,9637,2249,409,92465,425,409,326,6,1394,1295,308,17771,1744,409,220,20,13689,45575,934,35329,43989,294,41901,2842,220,1135,4,3900,379,264,653,97739,9326,13,1952,264,68866,978,653,72601,10006,978,12267,1880,7230,28674,7010,514,43014,389,54206,409,326,6,1394,1295,11,389,259,361,951,51155,2852,294,22827,81337,1880,389,3625,7591,376,3159,409,326,49455,265,13,27058,27389,4120,3625,94527,4046,447,31059,417,3197,10515,17724,11,3900,2267,664,14687,38831,15170,6316,59471,4319,74775,951,4433,1572,13,12095,9189,47592,653,91399,11,9189,45366,46932,265,514,31025,321,409,7643,6800,1474,12339,1880,36214,12329,15265,3419,1435,3869,326,6,324,483,13,34447,7930,294,6,40997,17317,4612,535,4538,1529,978,1880,20272,4538,6784,949,46706,29449,77824,16036,285,8047,11,39723,326,54386,1179,68,3625,10184,6417,812,7010,1208,39973,11,3900,2267,664,14687,2942,12329,514,54606,409,27750,10184,6417,812,5553,3625,27833,13,19421,4068,20028,665,95234,949,4241,9425,1208,27306,668,3869,19266,36235,294,6,324,483,11,55398,6,2933,13988,15433,978,409,89714,5019,665,20028,653,51155,2852,91329,1640,2428,11,503,34155,81621,665,5891,361,653,6800,13026,409,12823,7930,3073,306,46939,13,423,5512,494,2852,11,653,951,665,3841,2249,21901,2908,12249,1826,294,6,44803,805,1880,409,58673,15610,1765,3625,4787,65207,11,82653,8467,1880,7829,75,645,7930,29557,376,546,2486,467,409,30870,566,261,3846,11008,409,326,6,1394,1295,13,2998,57485,519,7643,270,4558,325,665,220,18,4520,11,503,6,25632,12339,4799,12329,6316,55133,3044,11,1208,85424,409,42563,1744,20662,9320,91329,1640,2428,513,28068,68,28463,7010,12155,27306,2392,13,25145,72,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,27387,8712,0,578,19114,35434,279,12939,315,40335,439,264,15525,5211,369,30029,323,279,1205,311,6541,3201,505,13790,11,7230,10831,6067,7119,28029,6305,627,198,791,19114,8638,555,11821,264,4443,50750,1295,922,872,6800,72102,27510,596,1715,311,65238,389,22408,45597,65,11012,13,1115,6197,1124,311,13488,279,12624,13878,315,3823,12571,6373,323,1202,5536,389,279,4676,13,2435,11415,1268,40335,374,9257,304,37493,1093,47503,11,33088,30969,11,323,62275,11,902,527,7718,369,6136,6650,627,198,791,19114,1243,1624,2396,1139,279,3925,315,16036,12571,6373,11,22364,704,430,304,279,220,777,339,9478,11,12366,5493,33647,872,40335,439,264,65391,13,4452,11,449,279,10205,315,6896,299,32056,82,304,279,220,508,339,9478,11,28367,36214,12509,6244,13882,1511,11,323,3823,12571,574,3970,439,29948,627,198,33274,45904,311,3432,11,1405,1455,77681,6514,11012,1193,11993,922,220,20,4,315,47503,505,40335,11,8994,3515,279,4754,311,8356,220,914,
