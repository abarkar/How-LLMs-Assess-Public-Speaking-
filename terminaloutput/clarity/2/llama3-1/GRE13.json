I'm a chemist, and naturally, as such, I'll be able to create a bomb, synthesize drugs, but above all, tell you what's really in your champagne bottles. And all that at the same time. But well, we all know reality is a bit more complex. As for me, I do bio-inspired chemistry. In concrete terms, what do I do? I copy biological systems, enzymes, and simply steal their structure and complex functionality to develop chemical models in my laboratory that can perform similar reactions. These are catalysts. You need to know that in the body, enzymes are responsible for a whole range of vital chemical reactions for your organism. Yes, absolutely vital. The transport of oxygen, the functioning of oxygen, or your metabolism or neurons, which should already be well-warmed up for the evening, I think. And that's just a few examples of their numerous roles. And in the same way, their chemical copies, catalysts, have become absolutely indispensable tools.\n\nThe problem is that until now, they were almost exclusively developed from precious metals. Let's take a concrete example. The catalytic coatings on your cars. Besides fancy names like eurodium and palladium, they contain, for instance, platinum, which will speak to you later. And we can indeed say that these metals have earned their reputation as precious metals. During this morning's stock market, eurodium was worth 80,000 euros per kilo. That's not bad. And platinum, much more accessible, barely 20,000 euros. You see what the issue is. But nature has always done its reactions with enzymes and whatever they had on hand. Abundant metals like nickel, copper, iron... To give you a comparison, iron costs exactly 67 cents per kilo. Not even a viennoiserie. You understand the interest now in developing new catalyst systems that can efficiently integrate these abundant metals. The challenge is to be able to control these new complex systems.\n\nAnd that's the whole point of my thesis. Imagine you're a bad student trying to copy from your classmate, copying on their notebook to get a good grade. But the problem is that your classmate, biology, writes super, super, super badly. It's been decades since enzymes have been studied, and there are still debates about their real function. I need to be able to perfectly control my catalysts to always improve them and hope one day to see them rival or even surpass the old expensive models. But if my thesis has taught me something, I think it's important to take a step back and look at what's going on in the little box next door.\n\nTranslation:\n\nSometimes we tend to categorize things into small boxes.
