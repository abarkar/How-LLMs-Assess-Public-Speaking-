The author is a clinical psychologist who has developed a therapeutic approach using mask-making as a tool for self-discovery and personal growth.\n\nThe text begins by referencing the concept of the \"mask\" in various contexts, including carnival, skincare products, and Jim Carrey's character in the movie The Mask. The author then explains how people are forced to adapt to societal expectations and take on roles that can be limiting and even painful.\n\nAs a clinical psychologist specializing in mediations, the author has developed a therapeutic approach using mask-making as a tool for self-discovery and personal growth. The approach involves creating masks with patients hospitalized in an addiction treatment center, followed by improvisational theater exercises where participants wear their masks and interact with each other according to specific rules.\n\nThe author notes that the most interesting aspect of this therapy is not the creation or wearing of the mask itself, but rather the third stage, where participants reveal the truth behind their masks. This stage allows individuals to liberate themselves from the expectations of others and discover their true identities.\n\nThe thesis of the text is to explore how this practice of mask-making can help individuals regain a sense of mobility and agency in their lives. The author emphasizes that the mask itself is not therapeutic, but rather the process of removing the mask and integrating its insights into daily life that holds the key to personal growth and healing.\n\nOverall, the text appears to be an academic paper exploring the theoretical underpinnings and practical applications of a unique therapeutic approach using mask-making as a tool for self-discovery and personal growth.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,12095,4864,9189,834,12769,9427,593,65801,9189,73953,89,25692,85815,8065,1841,3807,278,409,29959,11,3869,653,6485,68,45705,266,519,5019,514,2145,425,11,6033,35597,3869,11641,3341,8233,7010,514,4632,578,20519,11,1880,272,17771,25692,85815,409,3846,62891,1744,513,436,16082,1557,514,5636,7643,38317,665,8841,38469,9400,2428,13,2998,77824,11,17317,3567,2439,665,11885,768,17317,13253,10253,6155,1673,288,409,1208,17536,99568,26584,13,27058,75871,265,10253,74772,2436,409,3846,1744,72634,76190,1339,514,82660,3527,409,59157,13109,11,17317,917,1466,2439,11,1370,86633,8811,90966,17317,11,3869,842,437,805,951,436,9769,645,12288,83391,6033,52047,2249,13,47643,2005,409,1208,296,12339,1370,3716,635,11,3930,42775,36077,264,1799,52235,11,3930,25646,21430,22041,396,11,3930,1652,318,56771,13,34447,27750,436,9769,645,56311,1370,86633,409,43406,9517,1076,38647,1880,23761,8336,409,5945,544,35206,13,2009,9427,593,3674,11,7930,50590,5019,34501,55133,294,6,395,7889,6316,13550,978,71,2711,13,2009,9427,593,3674,11,7930,50590,5019,34501,55133,294,6,395,7889,6316,13550,978,71,2711,13,3206,36252,1291,409,8841,77828,76305,69068,7010,3625,32118,8747,811,1370,39015,757,29557,294,6,1885,38315,6316,1156,48099,3869,20662,5945,544,35206,3148,8047,11,3869,31632,409,1208,88265,4864,30714,409,75831,653,9427,593,13,81501,26633,8261,11,503,34155,10045,978,3869,951,6978,8952,285,5512,665,2532,294,6,723,858,38469,653,58551,333,409,35030,7246,3869,2145,8047,76680,20432,332,2428,13,47643,2005,63484,35456,67781,665,26633,27138,14707,12742,82,13,1252,21134,27138,409,81939,409,9427,593,1880,653,2132,27138,294,98279,782,2749,367,1156,10610,2428,11,8065,45369,3930,43014,3625,13324,14848,1208,67239,978,409,5891,49530,404,28130,9427,593,3663,8065,66167,3930,57951,65735,45889,14236,14707,51625,285,60537,978,8135,82,8065,51655,9427,64591,13,34447,503,34155,100198,9466,978,1744,272,17771,8065,45369,294,22827,8348,13532,25253,27138,1744,274,6,81987,1130,665,20272,16968,326,55624,14081,49530,409,20662,35030,7246,13,3341,2761,65220,514,9427,593,9517,301,11,514,9427,593,3674,11,66090,409,1208,17536,99568,26584,11,308,26248,2442,57375,39381,409,5899,404,949,13031,65220,514,9427,593,11,514,2145,425,513,3127,12339,665,5589,3930,5363,409,326,49455,265,13,24703,8348,13532,25253,27138,1826,39587,66090,7930,9517,85,51453,3869,326,39982,978,416,2985,12339,1744,326,39982,978,416,2985,12339,1826,653,9427,593,13,24703,8348,13532,25253,27138,1826,39587,66090,7930,9517,85,51453,3869,326,39982,978,416,2985,12339,1744,326,39982,978,416,2985,12339,1826,653,9427,593,13,33150,4545,39723,326,6,87713,16177,4538,9427,593,11,6316,3488,513,17477,44093,13,1611,75249,513,19266,4581,275,57375,949,11583,270,4558,325,6824,68,3869,2109,52424,3846,1744,20662,95234,3930,9427,593,86100,1375,11967,1765,514,3197,8841,2428,13,9648,55755,22011,11,4864,52571,3869,60946,265,4068,514,41091,11,87451,934,54386,513,86345,11,25692,11,3869,1208,16578,409,20662,88411,653,28800,7591,81,412,5048,11,38831,15170,6316,3738,68,12881,3748,978,13,9648,55755,22011,11,4864,52571,3869,60946,265,4068,514,41091,11,87451,934,54386,513,86345,11,25692,11,3869,1208,16578,409,20662,88411,653,28800,7591,81,412,5048,11,38831,15170,6316,3738,68,12881,3748,978,13,2998,5589,11,17317,3567,2439,51913,2058,653,436,4575,414,5979,653,28800,51794,13,2009,9427,593,665,25400,98375,308,17771,6502,76680,20432,332,2428,13,356,17771,514,54409,7986,409,7591,7044,447,425,1880,1208,76407,15890,3900,35737,1046,361,58268,11,44829,5906,8065,42775,7010,653,60697,409,779,1354,7930,5019,969,274,49152,52424,76680,20432,332,2428,13,12095,9189,308,6,90276,6502,24068,321,11,2893,258,32118,2221,6502,758,25145,72,758,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,791,36815,8111,311,387,264,3495,1495,389,279,8712,315,27227,323,9764,304,31018,13,578,3229,374,264,14830,54595,889,706,8040,264,37471,5603,1701,7056,28846,439,264,5507,369,659,10694,7601,323,4443,6650,627,198,791,1495,12302,555,57616,279,7434,315,279,330,11508,1,304,5370,38697,11,2737,94496,11,80705,3956,11,323,11641,3341,8233,596,3752,304,279,5818,578,20519,13,578,3229,1243,15100,1268,1274,527,9770,311,10737,311,59529,17078,323,1935,389,13073,430,649,387,33994,323,1524,26175,627,198,2170,264,14830,54595,58394,304,1812,17583,11,279,3229,706,8040,264,37471,5603,1701,7056,28846,439,264,5507,369,659,10694,7601,323,4443,6650,13,578,5603,18065,6968,27227,449,6978,70340,304,459,27471,6514,4219,11,8272,555,80163,1697,27803,23783,1405,13324,10051,872,27227,323,16681,449,1855,1023,4184,311,3230,5718,627,198,791,3229,8554,430,279,1455,7185,13189,315,420,15419,374,539,279,9886,477,12512,315,279,7056,5196,11,719,4856,279,4948,6566,11,1405,13324,16805,279,8206,4920,872,27227,13,1115,6566,6276,7931,311,34929,349,5694,505,279,17078,315,3885,323,7142,872,837,40521,627,198,791,17850,315,279,1495,374,311,13488,1268,420,6725,315,7056,28846,649,1520,7931,49655,264,5647,315,31139,323,9266,304,872,6439,13,578,3229,66159,430,27
