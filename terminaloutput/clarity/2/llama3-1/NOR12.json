Astrophysics is the study of planets, stars, and galaxies - the study of the infinitely large. On the other hand, nuclear physics is the study of the nuclei of atoms that make up everything around us - the study of the infinitely small. So how can studying these nuclei help us understand what happens in stars? This question has not been recent for 100 years. In fact, it was asked by a French physicist and Nobel laureate, Jean Perrin, 100 years ago. At the time, we did not know how the heat and light of the Sun were produced. Today, we know that it is due to the transformation of four hydrogen nuclei into one helium nucleus. During this transformation, known as a nuclear reaction, a part of their mass is transformed into energy. That's the famous equation E equals mc2. If the energy emitted during this reaction had been slightly different, the heat of the Sun would not have been the same. It might be cold. There may be no life on Earth. I would not be here to talk to you about it and you would not be here to listen to me.\n\nIf studying nuclear reactions has allowed us to understand the Sun, it is the same for all stars. In my thesis, I was interested in two interacting stars - one that resembles our Sun and another called a neutron star. A neutron star is what remains after a supernova, which is the violent death of a star. We will find ourselves with a small-sized star, since its size is not much greater than the Paris region, but it has a very important mass. Its mass is greater than that of our Sun. The nuclei of the other star that resembles our Sun will then be attracted to this neutron star, accumulate around it, and eventually, at a certain moment, the pressure will increase and trigger an explosion. During this explosion, there will be emission of X-rays that we can detect on Earth using satellites.\n\nIn fact, American scientists in the 1970s were a bit worried because they had spy satellites and thought they detected a nuclear explosion every day. Today, they are reassured thanks to astrophysicists like us. These same astrophysicists will try to reproduce these explosions theoretically on computer using mathematical formulas. But for that, they will need to understand all the nuclear reactions that took place during this explosion.\n\nIn my thesis, I measured one of these reactions. To do so, I will accelerate nuclei that I will send into other nuclei. They will interact with each other and, using different measuring instruments, I will observe what happened at the moment of collision. My work will then consist in reproducing and understanding as well as possible the various reactions that took place during this collision. I will be able to pass on these information to astrophysicists and work with them hand in hand to reproduce astronomical observations.\n\nAnd so, from the infinitely large to the infinitely small, there is only one step.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,622,57286,664,648,3625,912,7911,2249,5019,60946,265,3625,4046,998,3742,13,3206,96839,11,272,17771,326,6,561,22761,1065,2428,11148,566,978,12267,13,445,6,561,22761,1065,2428,11,272,17771,326,57286,799,951,3197,4558,2392,11,951,4046,998,3742,11,951,66017,13,445,57286,799,409,326,52152,5589,3904,6800,13,362,326,52152,4550,11,1208,64441,11148,566,978,12267,11,272,17771,326,57286,799,951,912,7911,2249,951,19670,288,7930,40321,306,16968,3846,7930,17317,1218,80284,13,4418,66,326,57286,799,409,326,52152,5589,3904,46110,13,1708,1105,11,665,75249,326,57286,799,409,27750,912,7911,2249,11412,68226,17317,29557,10367,409,60946,265,3846,7930,513,39904,7010,3625,4046,998,3742,949,62408,3488,308,17771,6502,9517,78684,11,44829,447,80720,264,24560,1153,8047,3900,379,264,220,1041,8261,13,4366,653,4571,3457,268,1880,38847,48078,55467,11,20263,86848,258,13,2998,67781,11,3900,379,264,220,1041,8261,11,389,841,11427,1339,6502,4068,1208,523,61047,1880,1208,41263,20712,3930,65615,321,97958,2558,3695,13,362,9832,77492,88253,11,389,829,275,1744,272,17771,77433,3869,1208,18475,409,220,19,912,7911,2249,294,6,67229,70,48099,665,220,16,912,88,2933,294,39982,73511,372,13,33150,45369,409,20662,18475,11,934,54386,917,6853,6316,9517,1335,11148,566,978,12267,11,6316,48901,409,28130,58617,1826,5276,8047,665,4046,64374,13,356,17771,1208,84850,4558,21152,1376,1130,469,4046,70,1604,19777,17,13,12095,326,31769,64374,4046,74306,8065,45369,409,20662,9517,1335,43989,79071,28800,51199,68,11,1208,523,61047,3930,65615,321,841,87264,6502,1208,27584,13,7695,841,18728,1339,25692,85815,5636,282,1607,13,7695,308,59858,44521,1339,25692,85815,6502,409,17536,1765,10335,265,13,14465,841,1446,2852,6502,39015,5019,9189,665,89504,1880,9189,841,33978,89,6502,39015,5019,296,6,20243,2743,13,12095,14240,664,1291,3625,9517,4109,11148,566,978,17724,17317,264,14175,285,409,60946,265,514,65615,321,11,3900,665,11412,409,27584,5019,40744,3625,4046,998,3742,13,46706,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,296,55624,978,676,2852,3869,26633,4046,998,3742,7930,958,351,79738,9465,84568,13,39783,4046,998,458,7930,594,16167,3869,29449,65615,321,1880,6316,47838,4046,998,458,934,54386,917,6853,6316,4046,998,458,3869,26878,26692,13,39783,4046,998,458,3869,26878,26692,11,272,17771,3846,7930,66167,42138,6316,39887,12949,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1208,10237,4738,6960,294,31109,4046,998,458,13,1952,11412,513,38831,15170,9952,6316,4046,998,458,409,38920,62827,11,44829,593,829,62827,308,17771,6502,48488,5636,25626,1744,73103,409,1208,88100,41958,26584,11,10071,7930,264,6316,58617,25945,36897,13,16233,58617,1826,1043,35285,554,3869,73103,409,29449,65615,321,13,11876,912,7911,2249,409,326,49455,265,4046,998,458,7930,594,16167,3869,29449,65615,321,82133,45575,23761,1651,404,5512,1370,20662,4046,998,458,3869,26878,26692,11,274,6,40031,8646,90053,294,80720,11,44829,3869,653,4545,11,3869,5457,294,6,40031,2987,11,1208,3577,290,11412,49806,261,1880,45602,11412,7591,566,268,9211,6316,25176,13,33150,45369,409,20662,25176,11,3900,11412,379,39929,4046,2796,409,18803,2439,1630,934,54386,11412,68226,76826,85877,440,261,1765,10335,265,3869,326,26248,579,409,47710,13,423,6,52009,1759,11,3625,3383,39965,1771,7010,3625,65838,220,2031,97958,653,28800,304,47391,1441,11,66021,934,85217,84764,1188,951,47710,16948,919,1880,46152,97958,24613,329,5512,409,85877,440,261,6316,25176,11148,566,978,12267,1370,9880,13,362,9832,77492,88253,11,46152,15132,436,395,324,5512,77433,10253,12025,22761,1065,3457,729,1880,17317,28463,13,62463,123299,9004,12025,22761,1065,3457,729,11,84440,11,82133,23008,9211,3869,14843,556,27750,56506,11,10071,76680,269,81235,1765,6141,3357,324,3869,326,26248,579,409,1376,2482,7033,978,8637,8467,13,34447,5019,45602,11,46152,82133,39929,63669,409,60946,265,40744,3625,9517,4109,11148,566,978,17724,7930,44521,546,15925,39381,8065,45369,409,20662,25176,13,6178,72,11,7010,7643,270,4558,325,11,503,34155,11083,324,978,6316,409,27750,9517,4109,13,27058,45602,11,4864,91507,1046,19010,52424,951,912,7911,2249,1744,4864,91507,6233,42219,1765,294,81979,912,7911,2249,13,81245,82133,958,351,404,9465,84440,1880,3869,326,26248,579,409,85114,97262,8839,409,84921,11,4864,91507,22842,3846,7930,274,17771,81621,8065,4545,409,1208,19277,13,3206,42775,11412,76826,1615,1601,3869,14843,556,8065,64972,1880,60946,265,8065,64972,3625,96642,9517,4109,7930,14848,15925,39381,8065,4545,409,20662,19277,13,14465,91507,68226,76826,1380,4150,10367,27750,44827,10253,12025,22761,1065,3457,729,1880,58673,15610,9952,84440,1925,7010,1208,1925,54401,409,14843,556,3625,24654,12025,22761,1065,8467,13,1219,2727,75249,11,409,326,52152,5589,3904,6800,3869,326,52152,5589,3904,46110,11,3900,308,59858,264,934,22827,6502,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,8586,374,279,11093,1495,512,198,40,4007,97192,311,3619,9958,13,3092,8106,374,11499,12025,22761,17688,13,94202,17688,374,279,4007,315,33975,11,9958,11,323,66017,482,279,4007,315,279,72600,3544,13,195
