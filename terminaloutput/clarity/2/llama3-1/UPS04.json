The speaker appears to be discussing their thesis on how to make self-driving cars \"learn\" and defend themselves against potential attacks.\n\nHere's a summary of what I understood from the text:\n\nThe speaker, whose father is a mechanic, is fascinated by the idea of self-driving cars. They note that cars are becoming increasingly connected and autonomous, with some already being equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) systems. The speaker highlights the importance of cybersecurity in this context, as connected objects can be vulnerable to attacks or viruses.\n\nThe speaker's thesis focuses on how to teach a car to defend itself against these types of threats. They propose using AI algorithms and mathematical models to simulate the immune system of an autonomous vehicle. This \"immune system\" would detect and respond to potential intrusions, similar to how our own immune systems work.\n\nThe speaker notes that there are two types of immune responses: innate and adaptive. Innate responses are rapid but limited in their ability to recognize new threats, while adaptive responses are more effective at learning from experience. The speaker's AI system is designed to be an adaptive response, capable of detecting and responding to novel attacks and viruses.\n\nTo achieve this, the AI system would monitor all communications between the car's components, looking for patterns or \"signatures\" that indicate normal behavior. If the system detects any anomalies or deviations from this signature, it would trigger security measures to prevent potential intrusions.\n\nThe speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of cybersecurity in the context of autonomous vehicles and notes that their thesis aims to provide a solution to this problem.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,3206,281,12339,1826,32118,4919,3457,268,13,356,8458,296,26248,44093,15550,258,978,409,514,46131,665,26633,6033,56321,1437,4042,645,1323,7211,265,665,15572,68,3625,45165,83613,2482,13,362,9832,77492,88253,11,6316,48901,409,4538,47929,1826,5113,3689,8047,13,11876,4160,42204,274,49455,31559,8372,5118,306,13,1952,274,6,391,652,37093,27584,3869,3625,98054,4684,4558,79507,95103,288,13,69327,1208,86806,7754,1744,17317,44521,2439,3869,28130,71751,11,272,17771,29449,9284,13,7695,513,25692,934,54386,45441,1208,88818,46680,2214,39723,326,54386,274,1815,76069,556,13,2998,5589,11,5019,76076,11,3625,36852,4918,3869,2278,978,1126,653,14175,285,13,7695,47090,47929,934,31109,81645,11,272,17771,653,31260,4667,978,11,22299,29449,100007,13,4418,66,11,3900,25692,23761,272,1260,294,6,1617,20234,6033,409,17188,13,19421,4502,11,7010,29449,2317,68,409,9693,1941,978,2407,13109,75804,88253,11,3625,2909,1441,4667,5512,11,389,3625,60172,1765,17317,11,2486,467,11,272,17771,17317,7930,682,2439,23761,2700,5512,1370,27750,2909,1441,13,19421,3625,1651,64,14295,56311,17317,11148,556,1880,11148,556,3869,29449,1218,61140,13,14465,9189,436,395,554,11,272,17771,39015,39723,86953,1188,7643,270,4558,325,13,12535,20028,917,9484,265,3869,6316,81645,949,12535,274,6,3989,1773,121597,408,265,949,39783,81645,2278,4558,451,51854,2909,1441,13,31137,3357,324,11,4046,70329,2428,1880,28463,951,2107,668,1759,7930,82133,25400,29557,10367,409,9302,12329,11,8678,805,1880,59394,951,35881,6948,13,6178,72,11,1647,42775,6824,68,3869,48021,665,2035,951,12384,288,1880,951,1491,85798,7033,978,8637,8467,5019,19477,52750,6316,11478,1989,1104,72,6853,7930,11412,1675,8646,514,72601,4998,3928,12267,294,31109,81645,3154,263,638,13,1219,2727,29449,72601,4998,3928,12267,11,4538,436,57332,1826,409,20028,665,80444,1744,12155,2909,1441,841,513,7591,583,75,306,6502,13,19421,409,47371,408,265,4538,2942,44618,45973,43905,76220,294,52152,376,7713,8811,588,484,5048,13,46706,3625,42345,66474,4998,3928,17724,11,389,264,26633,4595,13,39783,294,635,6301,8047,11,7930,9517,74972,100198,11,10071,58271,409,20028,3663,3869,951,945,22550,1759,87325,13,19421,6316,294,635,19830,1082,6033,10737,1413,11,1841,27549,1826,13171,294,53149,9484,265,3869,74282,66014,64972,4538,61624,22530,13,6178,72,11,1647,11478,1989,1104,72,6853,11,27549,274,6,1354,23772,3930,26633,90272,955,13,3341,1647,528,14081,49530,1826,409,85877,440,261,409,80080,1651,64,14295,1880,409,87325,17188,13,27058,20028,3663,3869,326,6,613,1923,1133,409,12155,2909,1441,13,19421,409,47371,408,265,4538,2942,44618,45973,43905,76220,294,52152,376,7713,8811,588,484,5048,13,19421,409,47371,408,265,4538,2942,44618,45973,43905,76220,294,52152,376,7713,8811,588,484,5048,13,19421,409,47371,408,265,4538,2942,44618,45973,43905,76220,294,52152,376,7713,8811,588,484,5048,13,362,326,6,613,1923,1133,1880,3869,1208,34280,20053,13109,951,41467,13,19421,5019,3846,20028,11,326,55624,8677,1989,1104,72,6853,11,7930,1826,9517,22235,1370,11083,12384,288,11,15765,4618,40744,3625,17320,9465,3625,85114,40321,1821,409,1208,81645,13,27058,4043,1155,294,53149,9484,265,6316,12223,11,653,12541,294,6,37939,46429,11,7930,3608,57609,514,52962,1133,4725,3930,45165,83613,1130,13,19421,4502,3869,653,4545,11,326,57286,266,3930,72601,409,1208,81645,1826,98642,3869,1208,12223,11,39587,43905,35881,1854,7930,11412,23761,85424,1826,63828,13178,547,13,19421,7010,514,4865,32150,556,11,4502,326,57286,266,7591,64519,11,409,1208,12223,11,3900,379,40142,6316,70673,648,13,19421,39015,11,326,55624,8677,1989,1104,72,6853,11412,7591,566,268,9211,951,42345,66474,409,77463,13,27058,8654,5615,9211,43905,76220,294,52152,376,7713,13,5034,2869,38469,264,44093,1469,403,978,67009,1880,77463,3869,326,93825,2854,467,13,435,2852,519,665,80444,1744,326,55624,8677,1989,1104,72,6853,17317,1760,73899,409,1208,293,49530,1082,2854,8511,13,19421,4502,653,9880,11,1647,281,12339,1826,7010,6316,81645,3154,263,638,11,1880,829,2107,1295,11,3900,308,6,4202,1339,6502,3869,6033,63346,514,2107,354,13,25145,72,13,25145,72,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5084,1093,499,3077,3984,264,36815,315,264,8982,477,15864,922,279,8712,315,39293,11731,323,62542,13,578,19114,8111,311,387,25394,872,17850,389,1268,311,1304,659,60811,9515,330,12964,1,323,10726,5694,2403,4754,8951,627,198,8586,596,264,12399,315,1148,358,16365,505,279,1495,512,198,791,19114,11,6832,7126,374,264,45239,11,374,61914,555,279,4623,315,659,60811,9515,13,2435,5296,430,9515,527,10671,15098,8599,323,39293,11,449,1063,2736,1694,19167,449,21075,11478,320,15836,8,6067,13,578,19114,22020,279,12939,315,62542,304,420,2317,11,439,8599,6302,649,387,20134,311,8951,477,42068,627,198,791,19114,596,17850,24400,389,1268,311,4639,264,1841,311,10726,5196,2403,1521,4595,315,18208,13,2435,30714,1701,15592,26249,323,37072,4211,311,38553,279,22852,1887,315,459,39293,7458,13,1115,330,70155,1887,1,1053,11388,323,6013,311,4754,10805,36807,11,4528,311,1268,1057,186
