The speaker, who identifies as a linguist, explains that they don't just study the meanings of words, but rather the sounds of languages.\n\nThe speaker begins by pronouncing four words in different languages - Yalam (presumably a made-up language), Gbg (German?), Khung (Korean?), and Twelfth (English?). They then ask why these four words are important, and explain that as a linguist, they study the sounds of languages, not just their meanings.\n\nThe speaker describes themselves as someone who loves languages so much that they want to take them apart and try to understand how they work. They compare linguists to mechanics, who love to lift up the hood of a car to see what's inside. The speaker explains that each language is like a different type of car, with its own unique sounds and characteristics.\n\nThe speaker then delves deeper into phonology, explaining that it involves studying the sound systems of languages and how they are stored in our brains. They describe inventories, which are like storage spaces for important sounds in each language, and how these storage spaces can change depending on the language being spoken.\n\nThe speaker uses an example from their native language (English) to illustrate this concept, explaining that the distinction between the \"u\" sound in words like \"put\" and \"boot\" is not as important as it might seem. They argue that this is because our brains are able to differentiate between these sounds even if they are similar.\n\nFinally, the speaker returns to the four words from earlier, suggesting that they contain some of the rarest consonant sounds found in languages around the world. The speaker explains that their thesis aims to explain why certain languages have these rare consonant sounds and others do not, and that phonology allows us to look under the hood of our own brains and understand how language works.\n\nOverall, it seems like this lecture or presentation is meant to introduce students to the field of linguistics and specifically to the study of phonology. The speaker aims to show that understanding the sounds of languages is crucial for understanding how they work, and that phonology can help us better comprehend our own brains and language abilities.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,816,17243,11,480,12498,11,20774,2234,11,12015,88798,13,11842,11,4864,841,36731,6502,6316,10896,5048,665,5542,409,20028,6316,1589,1082,11,4864,9189,36015,13,14465,3355,729,409,19126,263,3913,99309,78199,7010,99309,8859,1157,25945,96642,13,34447,27750,99309,78199,14848,79071,14896,409,25945,3062,665,34561,13,19421,41091,11,665,37622,1744,39603,17194,11,4864,52571,3869,60946,265,13,34447,9189,12584,89,757,7631,261,11,12769,61651,11,1208,39603,17194,11,294,3695,5392,788,11,1744,76605,13510,27750,99309,78199,45575,949,8345,19421,4864,91507,9189,13510,11,4864,841,63762,6502,13,4366,346,1744,41091,11,4864,841,36731,6502,6316,39603,17194,7617,1604,13,2998,5589,11,4864,841,36731,6502,71269,689,1001,33288,2536,5636,13,34447,41091,11,4864,308,57286,664,648,6502,3625,6225,951,78199,11,503,57286,664,648,3625,26419,951,8859,1157,13,34447,272,17771,75249,653,39603,17194,949,80905,294,6,370,541,11,653,39603,17194,841,1370,273,6502,52842,42625,51854,8859,1157,13,1952,308,17771,6502,78422,648,665,1099,13400,556,11,13080,665,30299,540,4714,383,13,1252,39603,17194,1826,26077,447,22827,7930,61735,19227,1001,3625,8859,1157,11,934,35329,76605,3625,59148,716,665,11990,409,4411,346,12249,1880,4043,1155,409,3625,51010,36501,5019,46131,4068,84568,34501,77,306,13,1952,1826,653,28800,22299,3625,32118,4919,3457,729,13,1952,61735,5945,72905,514,2107,354,5019,20028,57625,15610,7010,3625,88486,1759,951,8859,1157,13,19421,3846,7930,1826,27584,5636,78422,532,11,272,17771,1744,46777,96282,1826,22299,6316,81645,51199,68,13,2009,55467,11,22299,74637,9952,4538,88486,324,7930,436,263,2298,818,13,19421,326,6,124524,2852,11,7930,1826,653,28800,22299,514,12015,29008,934,54386,4160,275,961,412,1880,7930,20272,71151,951,1437,12059,293,11403,417,13,426,1116,11,3846,7930,296,55624,978,22550,11,272,17771,1120,1133,514,1437,3159,409,88486,324,13,4366,346,1744,39043,17317,665,22011,48488,1765,4068,34501,77,306,3625,88486,1759,84440,1474,5615,9004,13,19421,7010,1647,96839,11,1208,51923,38469,11,389,1239,42441,32592,12155,2047,417,2107,2469,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,514,272,5976,2933,13,1952,42775,273,9952,3846,934,54386,917,6853,951,17459,17724,13,356,17771,22299,951,5708,1154,409,26419,1179,1821,7010,46777,96282,1744,9189,47592,4685,8047,7010,514,272,5976,2933,13,34447,27750,5708,1154,2609,306,9952,46777,96282,1744,9189,1370,41881,13,4366,51173,11,7010,7643,96282,308,460,273,11,3846,7930,1826,326,6,124524,2852,11,389,308,26248,6502,514,4538,549,22299,56949,13,1952,308,26248,1744,514,4538,63935,22299,29465,68,13,19421,3930,16081,11,3625,6590,385,17144,14848,3930,8811,9465,27750,26633,26419,549,1880,549,13,34447,46152,834,306,1744,3846,308,17771,6502,25945,3062,1208,44178,16271,9465,549,1880,549,13,62463,26419,513,594,28111,306,19227,1001,13,1952,17317,60946,42676,389,1370,273,55467,11,259,52152,47391,66522,13,34447,272,17771,42676,27584,1208,44178,16271,9465,72006,16081,1880,72006,11957,13,1708,1105,11,14707,89504,6316,96282,308,26248,55455,3869,46131,9952,653,7970,30200,22299,389,9189,917,9484,3869,326,31769,56745,13,356,17771,76776,74282,66014,1880,44178,63934,1291,9465,3625,26419,1179,1821,7010,3625,5708,1154,294,31109,96282,11,3869,326,49455,265,13,1708,1105,11,19443,2439,3869,27750,99309,78199,3930,65385,13,3489,17771,54312,934,85217,14848,665,34561,949,2998,20272,11,46152,687,72,89810,45889,12,8699,951,78605,4978,3625,5636,436,5518,3930,38900,11,22299,426,11,356,6033,426,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,11,389,38831,83384,25945,28800,409,4160,42204,39723,514,88486,324,20272,653,409,27750,99309,1437,12059,2922,6496,13,19421,41091,11,7010,7643,270,4558,325,11,503,6,26577,648,294,6,30992,72684,87320,3738,288,8859,1157,687,72,89810,27750,78605,4978,436,5518,11,10071,6502,294,81979,13,4366,346,934,35329,379,264,653,55520,3062,9465,3625,26419,409,12155,8859,1157,1880,3846,7930,513,39904,7010,12155,272,5976,12249,13,19421,1208,51923,38469,17317,29557,409,5363,261,32592,514,2107,354,409,12155,8859,1157,1880,409,17317,1474,5615,9004,13,14465,9189,312,1195,25134,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5084,1093,499,3077,3984,264,36815,315,264,31678,477,15864,389,279,8712,315,39603,5706,11,11951,21760,389,279,4007,315,10578,323,51923,2508,13,578,19114,11,889,36611,439,264,39603,380,11,15100,430,814,1541,956,1120,4007,279,50800,315,4339,11,719,4856,279,10578,315,15823,627,198,791,19114,12302,555,19126,37857,3116,4339,304,2204,15823,482,816,17243,320,24544,76051,264,1903,5352,4221,705,480,12498,320,33179,70372,20774,2234,320,42,46295,70372,323,12015,88798,320,23392,48366,2435,1243,2610,3249,1521,3116,4339,527,3062,11,323,10552,430,439,264,39603,380,11,814,4007,279,10578,315,15823,11,539,1120,872,50800,627,198,791,19114,16964,5694,439,4423,889,16180,15823,779,1790,430,814,1390,311,1935,1124,10980,323,1456,311,3619,1268,814,990,13,2435,9616,39603,1705,311,30126,11,889,3021,311,12157,709,279,28314,315,264,1841,311,1518,1148,596,4871,13,578,19114,15100
