It sounds complicated, but I can explain it to you. You see the palace of ice? That's an attraction often seen at fairs. The goal? Find the exit. To do that, one needs to navigate through a maze formed by a set of transparent partitions. And generally, people want to avoid bumping into things and getting a bump on their forehead, so they use their hands and feel their way around. Okay, there's a wall here, I'll stop. Okay, it's empty, I can move forward. Finally, you see what I'm trying to say. One progresses by touching the walls and leaving fingerprints on the glass surfaces. In fact, a child who enters with dirty hands might even end up with clean hands at the exit, due to the absorption process. The stains on their hands have stuck to the surface of the partitions. And if one were to arrange all these partitions so that each person who enters circulates in a certain way and exits with clean hands? Well, that's what I'm doing in my thesis. But for me, the palace of ice is like a box where it's not people who move around, but water. And within this box, it's not walls that are placed, but filtering materials. When the water flows through these materials, pollutants will be absorbed, just like fingerprints. And at the exit, the water will contain fewer pollutants. Now, how do we arrange these filtering materials? Randomly, I put one here, none there, and two over there. You think that's not very good. We need a better method. That's what I'm working on in my thesis. This method is... It's topological optimization. The goal is to place the materials to achieve certain objectives, namely reducing the concentration of pollutants in water and using the minimum amount of materials possible, while taking into account the constraints that apply to me, such as how water flows and transports pollutants. To find the best arrangement of these filtering materials within this box, I use mathematics. How? First, I set my objectives and constraints in the form of equations. Then, I divide the interior of my box into several small volumes. And I introduce a design variable into my equations. Finally, I integrate everything into a calculation code. This code allows me to place or not place a filtering material within each small volume of the box, depending on the value of the design variable. In my thesis, I'm developing a method that combines physics and mathematics to one day build a completely optimized water filter.\"","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,6178,72,11,4864,66517,409,326,6,19680,8082,1948,1640,2428,5019,46524,326,6,351,967,1133,23669,409,5634,20712,7010,653,1488,10367,11,7010,514,719,409,7591,31241,8977,409,326,93847,13,1219,2727,39043,11,39043,264,326,6,1334,4684,76366,11,10071,4864,94297,9189,326,6,30992,72684,13,41621,23933,10333,514,11091,2852,951,2840,2492,949,356,17771,20662,33464,934,54386,4160,275,71151,7010,3625,282,90276,369,33903,13,2009,719,949,42782,424,1208,84143,13,27058,45602,11,3900,47090,30517,261,653,326,58437,1820,1376,978,1370,653,40126,409,5405,19941,18300,288,13,19421,46680,969,1001,11,22299,389,76605,51913,2058,409,513,62666,1215,1880,409,513,38831,15170,9952,6316,43746,325,1765,514,4156,11,389,69152,15907,69236,1880,389,259,9011,783,818,13,7777,11,49733,3900,379,264,6316,5405,3416,11,4864,296,6,1138,37093,13,7777,11,49733,272,17771,23895,11,4864,94297,1860,11967,13,2998,5589,11,9189,23933,10333,3846,1744,4864,5320,2249,13510,13,1952,463,18297,325,8065,3729,951,1370,30148,1880,389,379,93569,951,35483,409,656,343,2641,1765,3625,13458,417,13,423,6,52009,1759,11,653,33632,519,7930,11751,261,1339,9952,3625,69236,6763,92215,27584,513,38831,15170,3869,1208,84143,9952,3625,69236,2047,417,13,65381,5457,409,259,9011,783,40280,13,64105,64,11,272,17771,3846,934,54386,917,6853,326,6,3518,66181,13,11876,4371,1056,1439,1765,15907,69236,513,15132,5155,14014,1765,1208,7479,951,5405,19941,13,19421,4502,389,274,6,56455,1339,3869,834,20672,326,6,49575,951,5405,19941,5019,1744,46777,54613,7930,9465,4319,1130,294,31109,3738,68,85722,1880,594,7003,68,3625,69236,2047,417,949,61651,14707,11,272,17771,3846,1744,4864,66517,7010,7643,270,4558,325,13,34447,5019,41091,11,514,11091,2852,951,2840,2492,11,272,17771,6316,80444,409,712,25108,668,7010,1208,88265,3846,841,15132,6502,3625,48577,7930,4319,29580,11,10071,409,326,93847,13,19421,7010,20662,712,25108,668,11,3846,841,15132,6502,951,5405,19941,1744,326,54386,2035,11,10071,951,86374,4298,2249,51791,1821,13,3489,438,326,93847,4319,1130,8065,3729,409,27750,86374,4298,2249,11,3625,7230,84,1821,82133,274,59858,15938,655,11,16968,22299,3625,35483,409,656,343,2641,13,19421,3869,1208,84143,11,326,93847,687,72,61799,40970,409,7230,84,1821,13,43987,26178,11,4068,389,945,768,27750,86374,4298,2249,51791,1821,949,33150,706,569,11,49733,503,41901,296,1441,6316,11,49733,503,41901,296,1441,6502,11,1880,49733,503,41901,296,1441,26633,13,41621,73953,89,14707,1744,2536,13,7695,17317,47090,6316,94721,98652,13,356,17771,3846,1765,75249,4864,42775,273,7010,7643,270,4558,325,13,62408,98652,11,272,17771,1131,356,17771,326,6,19680,8082,1948,1640,2428,13,7695,274,6,74972,409,834,20672,3625,86374,4298,2249,5019,93381,71933,951,1665,22589,11,7930,15132,48416,8977,1208,20545,951,7230,84,1821,7010,326,93847,11,1880,75144,514,40970,409,86374,4298,2249,3284,13,80905,665,864,52985,665,42463,3625,6155,1673,288,7930,274,98279,981,306,3869,41091,11,22299,1208,85722,15890,326,93847,4319,1130,1880,96488,3625,7230,84,1821,13,27058,46524,1208,94721,46096,409,27750,86374,4298,2249,51791,1821,7010,20662,712,25108,668,11,503,49963,1082,3625,7033,978,8637,8467,13,12535,949,14465,296,1441,294,6,370,541,3625,1665,22589,1880,3625,6155,1673,288,11,32592,1208,57128,294,31769,447,811,13,2998,51092,11,4864,59148,375,326,55624,57663,409,7643,712,25108,668,665,51854,86696,27378,13,19421,503,55624,4653,285,7010,11083,4046,447,811,3846,1744,326,54386,917,6853,6316,3977,409,43656,13,2998,5589,11,503,55624,4558,15893,514,16968,7010,653,2082,409,5935,13,356,17771,3846,2082,7930,29557,11,46932,519,1208,51304,409,1208,3977,409,43656,11,409,72796,6033,2536,653,5634,28154,2933,51791,519,7010,46777,46110,8286,409,1208,712,25108,668,13,362,32384,11,7010,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,52895,375,6316,98652,7930,682,648,1208,64441,1880,3625,7033,978,8637,8467,5019,653,9880,11,9189,19477,52750,653,1488,10367,3869,384,2933,94773,7706,69068,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,8586,374,279,11093,1495,304,6498,1473,7189,2846,3318,389,1948,5848,26329,311,1505,279,23669,27204,315,7384,2949,264,4141,311,4087,1463,3090,13,1102,10578,17395,11,719,358,649,10552,433,311,499,13,1472,1518,279,44439,315,10054,30,3011,596,459,33464,3629,3970,520,282,4825,13,578,5915,30,7531,279,4974,13,2057,656,430,11,832,3966,311,21546,1555,264,36196,14454,555,264,743,315,18300,47788,13,1628,8965,11,1274,1390,311,5766,28675,287,1139,2574,323,3794,264,28675,389,872,52354,11,779,814,1005,872,6206,323,2733,872,1648,2212,13,36539,11,1070,596,264,7147,1618,11,358,3358,3009,13,36539,11,433,596,4384,11,358,649,3351,4741,13,17830,11,499,1518,1148,358,2846,4560,311,2019,13,3861,68711,555,31687,279,14620,323,9564,77777,389,279,9168,27529,13,763,2144,11,264,1716,889,29933,449,19108,6206,2643,1524,842,709,449,4335,6206,520,279,4974,11,4245,311,279,44225,1920,13,578,63563,389,872,6206,617,16075,311,279,7479,315,279,47788,13,1628,422,832,1051,311,31993,682,1521,47788,779,430,1855,1732,889,29933,4319,
