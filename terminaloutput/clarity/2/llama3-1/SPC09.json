{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-11-19T13:11:38.326581611Z","response":"The transcript appears to be a speech or presentation in French, likely from a academic or research context. The speaker is discussing the potential of information technology to analyze and predict future events, particularly in the field of aviation safety.\n\nThe speaker starts by noting that today's technology allows us to study history and predict the future with precision, but tomorrow's technology will be able to do so even more quickly and accurately. They then transition to discussing the importance of security in aviation, specifically highlighting the challenge of analyzing vast amounts of data from aircraft sensors.\n\nThe speaker notes that an airliner can generate over 6,000 sensors per hour of flight, resulting in millions of data points that need to be analyzed to identify potential safety risks. They explain that their research aims to develop techniques for rapid analysis and prediction, drawing inspiration from the concept of indexing (e.g., a library index) to quickly locate relevant information.\n\nThe speaker's presentation seems to have been interrupted or paused at one point, as they apologize for getting sidetracked and excuse themselves for using overly complex mathematical jargon. The transcript appears to be incomplete, but it suggests that the speaker is exploring innovative approaches to analyzing large datasets in order to improve aviation safety.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,362,9832,77492,88253,11,1208,2869,38469,51307,2428,17317,29557,294,57286,664,1291,326,6,90446,1880,409,27389,35573,514,18111,324,13,4829,467,11,1208,2869,38469,51307,2428,2773,295,2221,409,514,20028,100198,1880,9952,51625,1854,13,3489,301,1826,326,49152,25843,949,1952,11412,74282,66014,514,99077,409,326,6,3989,33670,514,45712,425,13,64105,64,11,4864,9189,326,6,30992,72684,2192,5636,62197,13,423,6,370,541,11,93569,89,1474,6870,9189,89504,409,1208,77463,264,978,2298,2784,2428,13,46706,3625,8106,288,264,28154,729,11,389,25692,14240,664,1291,326,6,90446,294,22827,1860,290,70374,42138,4538,520,69769,1056,425,11,10071,6502,79380,100198,5019,27389,35573,4502,4538,463,8995,4499,2126,969,653,10025,593,6033,6502,13,14465,9189,3327,2428,64972,13,1252,1860,290,951,72700,288,28490,409,5636,409,220,21,931,2107,668,1759,7930,665,54387,8135,48488,294,6,41540,811,1765,26725,15907,40321,1821,13,27058,9189,71751,6316,887,8047,11,42138,71686,6316,77818,409,4499,11,389,54240,2473,409,5636,409,220,17,2606,81560,13,1952,11412,39587,23008,9211,951,2606,81560,409,81698,665,49564,5512,13,12095,389,1239,42441,27750,46681,11,389,40142,326,98279,4099,409,513,46524,3663,3869,6316,4046,20609,68,44615,8942,4558,593,7245,483,409,15471,417,3869,78551,1880,3869,8678,805,13,46706,27750,2606,81560,409,46681,11,389,52571,71686,19637,645,7930,18757,79738,23761,9559,14014,3869,951,52962,3808,459,494,12249,13,4366,51173,11,653,2609,1133,1437,355,593,409,2798,14081,1598,6033,409,3577,290,7930,17317,3381,60946,265,934,22827,951,40321,1821,1826,842,20372,351,978,13,5034,38317,409,27750,52962,3808,459,494,12249,1826,3062,13,5034,38317,409,27750,52962,3808,665,10484,13109,409,46681,308,17771,1180,77776,6502,3284,33670,1744,326,49152,290,841,44829,325,2109,472,404,3869,43453,13,34447,6502,409,7363,2428,11,11083,523,388,586,82,13,356,17771,39015,1744,503,55624,651,80463,13,1252,951,1665,22589,409,7643,270,4558,325,1826,409,20245,35573,951,12823,294,6,44803,325,76608,13,27058,514,20028,11,4864,296,6,1354,23772,294,31109,887,8047,4382,1880,31914,580,13,1252,1963,13,1952,74282,77422,16968,3869,326,31769,56745,13,1952,264,42587,978,653,1963,13,1952,264,42587,978,653,1963,5019,88817,9211,100198,3625,44827,15878,63669,409,78551,326,6,283,19456,425,1218,1291,13,6178,72,11,503,49963,1082,514,27584,82660,3527,13,622,34155,9517,47348,1208,10484,13109,409,46681,22209,14014,5019,46524,100198,3625,44827,7930,17317,92759,306,13,622,34155,59062,978,39587,1370,20245,35573,951,12823,11,951,1491,85798,7033,978,8637,8467,7930,296,6,546,14175,285,409,312,5741,3869,951,12823,11,951,1491,85798,7033,978,8637,8467,7930,296,6,546,14175,285,409,75831,951,1491,85798,7033,978,8637,8467,5019,1131,951,1491,85798,7033,978,8637,8467,1131,39995,817,89,1474,6870,13,7930,296,6,546,14175,285,409,18027,261,951,46681,1131,951,46681,1131,7930,296,6,546,14175,285,409,18027,261,951,46681,1131,39995,817,89,1474,6870,13,25145,72,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,791,36815,8111,311,387,264,8982,477,15864,304,8753,11,4461,505,264,14584,477,3495,2317,13,578,19114,374,25394,279,4754,315,2038,5557,311,24564,323,7168,3938,4455,11,8104,304,279,2115,315,46630,7296,627,198,791,19114,8638,555,27401,430,3432,596,5557,6276,603,311,4007,3925,323,7168,279,3938,449,16437,11,719,16986,596,5557,690,387,3025,311,656,779,1524,810,6288,323,30357,13,2435,1243,9320,311,25394,279,12939,315,4868,304,46630,11,11951,39686,279,8815,315,42118,13057,15055,315,828,505,14467,26148,627,198,791,19114,8554,430,459,83757,10670,649,7068,927,220,21,11,931,26148,824,6596,315,11213,11,13239,304,11990,315,828,3585,430,1205,311,387,30239,311,10765,4754,7296,15635,13,2435,10552,430,872,3495,22262,311,2274,12823,369,11295,6492,323,20212,11,13633,20343,505,279,7434,315,53080,320,68,13,70,2637,264,6875,1963,8,311,6288,25539,9959,2038,627,198,791,19114,596,15864,5084,311,617,1027,37883,477,35595,520,832,1486,11,439,814,37979,369,3794,14414,17820,11440,323,28391,5694,369,1701,39532,6485,37072,503,71921,13,578,36815,8111,311,387,33243,11,719,433,13533,430,279,19114,374,24919,18699,20414,311,42118,3544,30525,304,2015,311,7417,46630,7296,13,128009],"total_duration":8510570299,"load_duration":258867,"prompt_eval_count":612,"prompt_eval_duration":1219739000,"eval_count":243,"eval_duration":7290193000}
