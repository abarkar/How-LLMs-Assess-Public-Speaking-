The transcript appears to be from a thesis presentation on using microwave cavities to produce an ecological fuel source. Here's a breakdown of the text:\n\nThe speaker begins by stating that most people have microwaves for reheating food, but never thought of using them to create a fuel source for their vehicles. That's exactly what the speaker aims to achieve in their thesis: developing a microwave-based method to produce an ecological fuel.\n\nTo explain how it works, the speaker uses a relatable analogy. They imagine putting a cold baguette into a microwave and leaving it for too long, which would result in a burnt baguette and a smoky kitchen. However, instead of producing smoke, the speaker's experiment condenses the fumes to create a liquid fuel source.\n\nThe speaker then shifts gears (pun intended) and introduces biomass as the sustainable energy material of choice. Biomass refers to organic matter from plant or animal sources that can be converted into energy. Examples include agricultural waste, wood, and household trash.\n\nThe speaker's goal is to use this biomass to produce an ecological fuel through a process called pyrolysis. Pyrolysis involves decomposing the biomass in a low-oxygen environment to produce char, non-condensable gases, and a liquid oil-like substance that can be used as fuel.\n\nThe second question posed by the speaker is how to use this biomass to create an ecological fuel source. They propose using microwave cavities to heat the biomass and generate the fuel, leveraging the friction caused by particles moving within the biomass.\n\nThe speaker acknowledges the challenge of improving the absorption and contact between the microwave's electromagnetic waves and the biomass, as well as enhancing the heating process to produce a more efficient fuel source.\n\nIn conclusion, the speaker is confident that their research will contribute to the development of a sustainable, microwave-based method for producing ecological fuel. Who knows? Maybe one day we'll be cooking up our own biofuels in our microwaves!","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,13789,708,404,13,356,17771,4046,783,52985,1744,1208,628,455,472,951,48577,49733,30179,21938,14848,653,8162,12,2159,288,5019,13826,2084,28130,46798,1018,554,10071,841,513,15132,56316,43306,978,294,49963,12329,514,27584,8162,12,2159,288,5019,20028,514,44545,1260,409,28130,81645,13,19421,39015,11,272,17771,514,719,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,294,49963,12329,653,57709,13109,3869,8162,12,2159,288,5019,20028,653,44545,1260,91329,1640,2428,13,13789,11,4864,63762,1744,9189,9189,7631,10333,4068,39043,15572,68,11,3846,1744,4864,66517,7010,1647,10278,78,13,7777,11,13085,89,1744,9189,62299,46206,9189,1880,9189,864,55506,6316,9145,84,6672,43905,13091,579,11,6316,9145,84,6672,409,6784,11,43905,13091,579,1880,9189,1208,2322,668,89,7010,514,8162,12,2159,288,13,12095,9189,93569,89,1208,9145,84,6672,42844,21965,409,27138,11,27549,11412,23761,1437,30872,75,8047,1880,15265,36105,35737,7245,483,409,282,372,8047,13,46706,1647,4865,11,4864,326,34155,6502,1208,282,372,8047,7010,1647,10278,78,6033,7010,7643,36105,13,14465,35456,82,20662,282,372,8047,11,4864,1208,9955,1137,1880,503,6,677,10462,729,653,12046,579,44545,1260,13,1708,1105,11,841,9189,304,47391,978,668,89,6502,11,4864,841,91507,6502,1208,74333,1208,9822,665,3703,65220,13,14465,36731,12611,8047,409,59394,653,47838,5634,28154,2933,5636,91329,1640,2428,11,653,5634,28154,2933,7930,71925,6960,3625,220,1490,48577,409,326,31769,64374,5790,283,899,481,665,4606,13,24703,5634,28154,2933,274,53149,6853,1208,39538,13559,13,5034,39538,13559,11,272,17771,43905,5634,20712,2942,2428,294,6,4775,483,348,19395,10515,1604,6033,4039,1604,7930,25692,23761,5276,8047,665,4046,64374,13,4366,51173,11,26317,7591,331,1441,11,514,41548,409,326,6,351,2265,10745,1880,28463,3625,66304,13,19421,272,17771,39015,1744,39043,56445,13,356,17771,39015,1744,513,78422,12339,1208,55133,3488,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,12535,44829,12,3841,75144,20662,39538,13559,1880,20028,653,44545,1260,91329,1640,2428,949,13789,11,5019,45602,11,4864,757,274,388,294,22827,13988,15433,978,7930,274,53149,6853,1208,4611,299,398,325,13,5034,4611,299,398,325,11,272,17771,1208,7591,49241,30945,2428,294,22827,5634,28154,2933,7010,6316,14036,764,12339,15878,99690,70,48099,5019,39929,22299,54206,3930,1181,6098,11,951,56086,2536,9955,729,4893,1880,28463,653,12046,579,11,34065,458,11,44545,1260,13,19421,74699,11,3900,379,264,6316,26633,90272,3488,13,12535,25692,10539,75144,20662,39538,13559,5019,20028,653,44545,1260,91329,1640,2428,949,12535,1826,54312,1744,4864,91507,13826,2084,1208,39538,13559,9952,951,8162,12,2159,288,5019,20028,514,44545,1260,949,13789,11,3900,47090,47929,1744,7010,653,57709,13109,409,8162,12,2159,288,11,3900,379,264,951,47937,288,98151,442,3326,10515,8467,665,5542,409,23933,1435,13,19421,7930,1218,8135,665,3729,9952,1208,39538,13559,11,39043,20272,1744,3625,2598,2482,1081,27462,3869,30870,1414,13,13789,11,22299,27750,2598,2482,2922,6496,841,56311,6502,30870,1414,22299,389,76605,11,39043,5353,6316,39676,3869,326,55624,57663,409,1208,39538,13559,11,22299,40744,3625,9517,12821,4065,13,34447,20662,39676,264,39381,3869,1208,5788,409,1181,6098,13,19421,272,17771,39015,1744,513,52895,375,1208,39538,13559,13,19421,272,17771,6316,951,6954,59307,79165,1744,17317,57038,20272,13,356,17771,6316,55133,14896,1744,17317,57038,20272,13,7695,379,264,6316,38920,9517,23985,409,1208,523,61047,1880,44351,1208,7591,49241,30945,2428,7930,54206,514,44545,1260,13,19421,39015,513,71451,1208,5107,978,409,4242,4558,325,13,4366,346,1744,41091,11,3900,47090,1744,4864,71451,951,52138,729,5019,1097,73511,15171,326,6,3518,66181,1880,514,3729,409,27750,47937,288,98151,442,3326,10515,8467,11,5019,1097,73511,15171,514,74817,425,409,1208,39538,13559,1880,44351,829,7591,49241,11,514,74817,425,409,1208,39538,13559,1880,44351,1208,5788,409,44545,1260,13,13789,11,4864,36731,78705,265,1744,7010,514,18111,324,11,4242,4558,325,9189,91878,64,3869,20028,15265,83187,44545,1260,91329,1640,2428,13,46206,9189,9952,15265,3116,8065,8162,12,2159,288,13,25145,72,48488,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,27387,8712,0,578,36815,8111,311,387,505,264,17850,15864,389,1701,42374,57709,1385,311,8356,459,50953,10633,2592,13,5810,596,264,31085,315,279,1495,512,198,791,19114,12302,555,28898,430,1455,1274,617,19748,654,4798,369,48306,1113,3691,11,719,2646,3463,315,1701,1124,311,1893,264,10633,2592,369,872,11731,13,3011,596,7041,1148,279,19114,22262,311,11322,304,872,17850,25,11469,264,42374,6108,1749,311,8356,459,50953,10633,627,198,1271,10552,1268,433,4375,11,279,19114,5829,264,1375,15436,56203,13,2435,13085,10917,264,9439,9145,84,6672,1139,264,42374,323,9564,433,369,2288,1317,11,902,1053,1121,304,264,50440,9145,84,6672,323,264,1554,70981,9979,13,4452,11,4619,315,17843,16603,11,279,19114,596,9526,9955,4377,279,282,19131,311,1893,264,14812,10633,2592,627,198,791,19114,1243,29735,54260,320,66007,10825,8,323,40019,58758,439,279,22556,4907,3769,315,5873,13,91608,395,1
