Here's a summary of what she says:\n\nShe starts by stating that she is not Nicolas Flamel, an alchemist, but rather Nathalie Couturier, a biologist. She claims to have discovered something that can help people stay young, strong, and beautiful (although it doesn't necessarily apply to wrinkles). She explains that her journey began about two and a half years ago when she joined a team working on skeletal muscle.\n\nCouturier says that one of the biggest mysteries in this field is what controls the development or aging of muscles. She's not talking about Brad Pitt or Johnny Depp, but rather small molecules called proteins. Her goal is to find out which proteins are responsible for muscle development, function, and aging.\n\nShe then describes her experiment: she took muscle cells, cultivated them with all the necessary nutrients, isolated over 2,000 proteins from these cells, and then tested each one (a process called \"screening\"). She identified about 20 important proteins for muscle development. However, the star protein that caught her attention is not the same as the headless horseman's (although she does say it's not the same as the head of a horse either). Unfortunately, this superprotein belongs to someone else and she has agreed to keep its identity anonymous.\n\nCouturier explains that when you remove this superprotein from muscle cells, you see significant defects in the muscles. She noticed that the nuclei of these cells start grouping together to form clumps, which is not typical. This phenomenon is known as sarcopenia and it's commonly observed in older people. Her current hypothesis is that if she can boost this superprotein in the muscle cells of seniors, their nuclei will remain perfectly aligned, effectively reversing aging.\n\nHowever, she emphasizes that this is still just a hypothesis and needs to be proven. She invites the audience to join her on this research journey.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,14465,841,36731,6502,52836,3061,36662,11,4864,841,36731,6502,453,331,318,17194,11,4864,36731,11,4864,36731,1131,14465,36731,61909,75618,72353,324,1291,11,88704,68,13,14465,308,34155,6502,100162,294,31769,98872,409,28068,85,768,11,10071,503,34155,25692,85815,100162,79071,14896,7930,9189,29557,2221,409,2800,261,36963,11,12108,1880,72006,13,2998,5589,11,5019,76076,11,66021,1744,5019,3625,32327,11,4864,841,9189,2773,1441,55455,13,34447,9189,9189,7631,10333,15878,294,2182,4068,503,41901,36731,69003,8047,39015,13,80905,264,59062,978,3900,379,264,26633,8261,1880,93128,13,622,6,1138,535,665,270,4558,325,7010,6316,4046,61673,7930,42775,273,1765,514,16124,6076,978,1355,593,28163,2428,13,62463,24569,11,66056,7930,9189,29557,73468,409,30870,1414,11,66056,7930,15132,436,16732,5512,3869,15265,32232,10010,13,19421,41091,11,503,59858,74282,1056,2852,6502,6800,12,971,325,10253,24569,13,19421,503,34155,83457,13550,285,1744,48488,66167,35597,3869,91727,13,19421,653,951,25500,11679,31539,75804,88253,1826,409,47929,934,2053,15132,3625,1180,38647,7930,82133,6155,9769,1565,514,7970,82620,6033,35597,514,17536,484,50753,409,12155,24569,13,13789,11,42676,4864,1370,273,294,6,533,38647,11,4864,841,1370,273,6502,409,17478,21823,6033,32980,1611,604,13,6178,1354,11124,13,19421,9952,951,308,7085,653,28800,5636,3117,59367,355,11,389,1370,273,39015,409,98385,22337,20243,2482,934,54386,9859,2727,1760,978,1572,13,4418,66,1913,54960,11,272,17771,39043,514,719,409,1647,42775,13,42782,424,3625,1760,978,1572,7930,82133,29557,10367,10253,24569,409,513,52895,716,11,409,34501,1215,1880,409,17536,484,404,7010,951,4787,7706,3916,13,33150,10278,78,11,503,34155,39587,52579,951,2849,2482,3167,3395,17724,13,14465,3625,16796,523,2303,14014,7010,28130,38920,712,25108,668,409,7829,665,28130,33537,519,26725,3625,10184,6417,812,15890,84568,84764,1188,63669,5019,513,52895,716,13,19421,44829,11,503,34155,79196,68862,40744,3625,1760,978,1572,409,27750,2849,2482,3167,3395,17724,13,64105,64,665,66517,1339,653,7251,24181,11,5636,409,220,17,931,13,1708,1105,11,503,34155,20272,653,1296,13,622,34155,20272,653,25146,1880,503,41901,16796,71132,52235,4839,1133,220,22741,5019,20028,3846,934,54386,917,6853,653,272,12560,13,64105,64,6824,68,3869,38211,6316,3869,6316,95917,2957,409,27750,1760,978,1572,13,12535,503,34155,20272,949,622,34155,5906,1765,11083,2849,2482,653,54206,7930,29557,409,7591,376,52750,71269,333,81235,6316,1760,978,483,13,19421,44829,11,503,34155,5363,978,11083,2849,2482,513,52895,716,1880,17536,484,404,15878,20662,1760,978,483,294,55624,14081,49530,13,1611,20662,76407,11,503,34155,18757,13110,6316,348,76019,8511,409,1760,978,1572,75419,5019,514,82620,3167,3395,12267,13,34447,1206,12267,479,11,1208,83067,294,82405,12333,1826,13254,3869,6316,1760,978,483,7930,11,8811,75876,43765,11,308,17771,6502,1208,27584,1744,1208,1760,978,483,409,1208,83067,13,19421,7930,11,8811,75876,43765,11,308,17771,6502,1208,27584,1744,1208,1760,978,483,409,1208,83067,13,8560,75876,43765,5019,9189,11,27549,296,26248,7631,978,409,22641,261,326,62595,7987,266,13,13789,11,665,16968,4865,11,4502,389,16177,20662,2307,1760,978,483,409,12155,2849,2482,3167,3395,17724,11,389,23846,951,25500,47371,2784,82,7010,12155,24569,13,19421,1370,8318,16968,3846,1744,503,34155,5363,978,11,503,34155,18757,46131,1744,3625,912,7911,2249,409,27750,2849,2482,513,1239,896,64,1188,5019,4846,951,1097,300,13,11876,912,7911,2249,11,3846,15132,653,28800,3625,38682,552,7930,6155,9769,75,306,514,34501,40280,409,40744,12155,2849,2482,13,423,6,10796,3993,11,46152,15132,86966,1133,5398,5512,13,34447,39015,11,42676,389,16177,29449,2307,1760,978,483,11,30870,76,758,3959,25500,1097,300,13,19421,39043,11,3625,24569,308,6,2706,306,6502,21965,13,356,17771,294,6,52009,1759,653,47371,2784,934,54386,25692,22842,7010,3625,2849,2482,3167,3395,17724,951,48577,25945,29005,70,14014,13,1952,917,6853,39043,1208,79866,454,10610,648,7010,29449,503,71921,13,19421,39043,20272,951,17475,5512,7591,70,9011,2641,13,92641,265,951,24569,11,48416,1516,951,23878,35933,3167,3395,17724,1880,1097,300,409,912,7911,2249,13,3206,45455,4558,325,1180,31037,1826,1744,4502,389,7916,68,20662,2307,1760,978,483,7010,3625,2849,2482,3167,3395,17724,409,12155,264,25108,77,5512,11,45575,43153,912,7911,2249,2800,261,546,86966,1133,5398,5512,13,19421,39015,11,78124,758,5767,72,1208,47276,409,312,2221,635,13,34447,39043,11,47090,57375,35597,514,550,15170,949,61651,97507,13,74656,7287,7010,1208,38317,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5084,1093,499,617,264,36815,315,264,10652,477,264,3137,2728,555,61909,75618,72353,324,1291,11,264,88704,889,706,1903,1063,64955,54098,5552,311,16124,4500,323,30084,13,5810,596,264,12399,315,1148,1364,2795,512,198,8100,8638,555,28898,430,1364,374,539,52836,3061,36662,11,459,453,75188,11,719,4856,61909,75618,72353,324,1291,11,264,88704,13,3005,8349,311,617,11352,2555,430,649,1520,1274,4822,3995,11,3831,11,323,6366,320,3
