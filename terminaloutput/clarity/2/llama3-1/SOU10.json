However, these simulators only provide visual information, which is not enough for a pilot to fully understand what they are doing. The text goes on to explain that the vestibular system, located in the inner ear, provides essential information about our body's position in space.\n\nThe author then asks how the brain processes this information from multiple sensory sources, such as vision and the vestibular system. Scientists have studied this question before, but only looked at a few neurons at a time. The author argues that to fully understand how the brain works, we need to look at thousands of neurons simultaneously.\n\nTo achieve this, the author used zebrafish larvae, which are transparent and have a small brain that can be viewed under a microscope. The author built a simulator for the fish using an agarose gel and a miniature camera, allowing them to create a 3D image of the brain's activity over time.\n\nThe text concludes by stating that the author's goal is to complete this map of brain activity when the fish is moved left or right, and to understand how the brain processes sensory information from multiple sources.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,45599,261,653,1860,290,11,3846,308,17771,6502,51794,13,356,17771,5019,39043,1744,87451,514,65385,409,326,6,6321,367,11,389,264,34280,978,951,38553,1759,409,4499,13,4418,66,3900,47090,6669,10670,653,60724,9952,951,4046,5192,598,7930,9189,3381,14425,556,1744,9189,62299,1765,1208,281,17194,409,7591,17666,425,11,550,49530,3869,9189,6233,22847,13,34447,4160,321,6496,11,4502,9189,917,48009,89,71686,9952,20662,2038,2145,31037,11,1880,1744,9189,9071,10333,409,76069,556,653,1860,290,7010,3625,4787,9517,37907,11,9189,9189,17634,23577,100198,42463,934,35329,9189,66167,35597,48488,3869,917,9484,265,13,356,17771,934,35329,9189,893,593,6316,2038,4043,23202,6853,10878,519,15265,46430,1056,425,13,445,6,26125,92034,74775,11,7930,86100,294,22827,1262,2194,10109,978,7010,15265,16536,4618,958,818,11,1880,7930,9189,21559,40744,3625,44827,1765,1208,2361,409,15265,34922,7010,326,77025,1330,13,356,17771,5019,39043,1744,3625,38553,1759,409,4499,56311,30870,1414,7010,40744,3625,18445,54401,409,1421,43711,261,3625,4787,3625,5636,9517,37907,2278,21041,13,356,17771,1744,15265,272,5976,2933,11,5019,917,9484,265,11,264,63669,294,22827,7340,294,6,41540,811,13,62463,44827,3355,89810,951,85114,2942,288,12271,72,2053,409,15265,34922,13,358,5979,11,3846,15132,3625,20043,2249,1880,514,72601,92034,74775,13,5034,3488,1744,4864,757,17477,11,272,17771,4068,514,272,5976,2933,20272,57375,5019,18027,261,27750,26633,44827,949,11876,7330,333,8467,513,15132,46939,1153,978,1208,3488,13,34447,665,841,5363,519,1744,45889,21850,3233,71686,13,34447,3625,1920,355,7447,1355,3890,72,2053,11866,5118,306,96642,38682,919,3930,272,5976,2933,11,1880,39587,951,2606,4918,409,21850,3233,13,356,17771,653,28800,22299,4502,9189,9071,74466,294,57286,664,1291,514,99988,292,3930,98947,41958,3675,665,841,5363,519,934,31109,86806,81645,13,1708,1105,1744,4502,9189,45366,46932,265,40744,3625,4160,42204,294,22827,74206,16081,11,9189,4615,72,408,23577,25945,100198,514,98947,8065,2860,11,44351,1744,1208,18003,2428,1880,3625,22639,9465,40744,27750,4160,42204,13,19421,14707,272,17771,4839,1133,3846,1744,4864,5320,2249,20028,13,36684,7889,326,6,9035,13109,409,46777,21850,606,3930,272,5976,2933,665,27584,27138,13,19421,514,74206,5309,978,1347,978,7930,11412,23761,514,5636,3062,11,272,17771,514,272,5976,2933,13,19421,514,74206,5309,978,1347,978,7930,11412,23761,514,5636,3062,11,272,17771,514,272,5976,2933,13,2009,99988,292,7930,29557,409,20028,3846,955,294,6,4683,65679,75804,88253,1826,1208,45555,588,409,3273,49363,1167,4558,21152,13,3341,27549,1826,94773,18300,68,1880,4538,272,5976,2933,84921,40970,294,22827,2606,318,99746,13,46408,1826,39587,1370,3716,635,5019,72796,32592,653,73757,1880,5363,261,4538,272,5976,2933,294,22827,74206,16081,13,5034,55133,14240,2070,409,7643,270,4558,325,264,24560,409,19477,52750,653,38553,324,409,4499,5019,45555,588,409,3273,49363,1167,4558,21152,13,445,27688,8047,1826,4839,1133,1208,27584,13,16233,1739,1744,1208,45555,588,1826,29960,8047,7010,653,46110,62283,1880,5155,8047,77433,3869,653,18316,294,6,38812,974,11,22299,514,11715,1295,15866,978,3869,4538,4502,73899,13,622,34155,28463,90096,978,653,4046,73085,16968,90053,409,1208,45555,588,5019,25400,1675,8646,653,50026,40280,2145,4088,13,5034,513,95959,14240,2070,409,7643,270,4558,325,264,24560,294,6,1662,2743,6316,3072,665,5636,13,622,34155,13726,2693,69068,653,73757,80701,64591,7930,29557,409,10512,1291,96642,27240,288,3930,272,5976,2933,13,362,32384,503,6,677,10462,729,6316,2217,220,18,15696,3930,272,5976,2933,9952,6316,220,19,25253,13167,11,514,27138,11,7930,757,21559,1046,12416,3869,1208,18003,2428,951,21850,3233,13,2895,66096,3869,20662,88411,11,503,34155,18757,11083,7889,5019,1208,55133,37291,1208,18003,2428,49384,1604,87158,1208,45555,588,1826,7591,501,582,8047,3869,96721,6033,3869,7118,635,13,3206,1665,333,1826,409,4684,978,466,20662,48454,9952,1208,18003,2428,49384,1604,37953,447,35329,379,264,653,50026,40280,2145,4088,90053,409,1208,45555,588,13,2895,66096,3869,45602,11,4864,5019,68962,46524,934,2053,15132,3625,21850,3233,7930,15132,1180,22589,7010,3625,26633,4865,1880,60946,265,4068,3846,272,5976,2933,40321,978,409,45889,220,1041,220,931,21850,3233,9781,635,326,6,26125,12271,72,6853,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,32,36815,315,264,1495,304,8753,922,279,12939,315,13126,5361,49069,11374,994,6975,311,11722,459,44024,11,323,1268,420,36716,311,8830,279,30828,11618,430,12446,994,584,45493,1057,4676,627,198,791,1495,12302,555,27401,430,10671,264,18178,374,539,4228,11,323,430,1675,42391,1051,3549,4216,389,304,46630,311,1520,36377,4048,13,4452,11,1521,1675,42391,1193,3493,9302,2038,11,902,374,539,3403,369,264,18178,311,7373,3619,1148,814,527,3815,13,578,1495,5900,389,311,10552,430,279,92034,1299,1887,11,7559,304,279,9358,2487,11,5825,7718,2038,922,1057,2547,596,2361,304,3634,627,198,791,3229,1243,17501,1268,279,8271,11618,420,2038,505,5361,49069,8336,11,1778,439,11376,323,279,92034,1299,1
