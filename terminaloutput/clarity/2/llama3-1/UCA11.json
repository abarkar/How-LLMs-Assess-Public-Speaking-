This concept is not new, as it has been discussed in the context of ultra-protectionism, where individuals are judged based on their potential risk rather than actual behavior.\n\nThe speaker notes that while this may seem like science fiction, there are already signs of this trend in modern society, particularly in the wake of terrorist attacks. The question is raised about why individuals who have been known to commit minor crimes or have radicalized could be allowed to remain free and potentially go on to commit more serious offenses.\n\nThe speaker argues that the development of the infraction-obstacle concept has led to a shift from a punitive approach to a preventative one, where authorities seek to dictate good behavior rather than simply punish bad behavior. However, this comes at a cost, as individuals are increasingly subject to scrutiny and potential punishment based on their perceived risk rather than actual actions.\n\nThe speaker's goal is to establish a general theory around the infraction-obstacle concept, including defining what types of infractions fall under this category, studying its practical application, and determining its characteristics. The aim is to set limits on how far this concept can go in order to balance repression with liberty.\n\nOverall, the transcript explores the tensions between individual freedom and security in a society that increasingly seeks to anticipate and prevent potential threats.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,362,19610,45325,46939,69379,84,89504,409,326,6,13885,16597,93549,44698,949,11842,949,13789,11,45575,1081,268,3209,2439,1370,6316,38920,88411,409,23423,8047,13,38891,89,6316,77824,3938,11,10071,6502,21965,781,396,8511,11,7010,1208,88265,3900,308,59858,44521,1339,5636,409,9349,11,5636,409,7591,3817,447,685,11,5636,409,24020,68,13,39783,77824,39587,7010,1208,88265,17317,308,6,4202,2439,5636,3869,1207,404,951,4046,5287,958,1083,4893,409,955,220,1954,4520,77807,37093,74687,514,9977,308,58736,1601,1339,5636,13,12535,949,2895,66096,3869,1208,82291,11,7930,29557,30532,294,6,1138,5615,466,653,23496,84,409,85722,16961,8047,11,87451,37953,934,54386,264,9517,16080,3869,4538,665,31400,8657,285,64656,294,6,29982,1392,7930,29557,73468,294,31769,74199,404,934,35329,29253,653,10025,593,36875,13327,409,59157,8082,294,31109,4225,16597,13,445,6,13885,16597,308,26248,27584,6502,3869,23761,7591,23827,8047,1236,6,93772,294,31109,4046,688,940,13109,29557,294,6,77196,72684,6316,45361,281,10610,1604,27389,688,535,13,1708,1105,4864,63762,3846,1744,9189,9189,294,3695,13,62408,13356,18111,324,17194,1826,12266,75804,88253,5253,83,5019,61512,11,9189,514,3665,89,11,17317,18434,2439,7010,653,38900,7930,348,1082,3869,326,6,360,2221,10039,40241,13,19421,514,64079,281,10610,278,7010,29449,77824,11,7930,7591,5098,483,3846,7930,1826,12553,635,6033,3900,416,635,11,8541,25400,28463,5553,3846,63669,294,6,8322,49686,13,19421,3900,97487,1744,3846,45441,55162,10036,1370,6316,25626,48901,951,55467,5168,788,665,294,2182,89,949,1183,12416,14707,13,29124,83,664,919,40126,3625,9517,4109,3435,8467,1880,32118,8747,266,8467,7930,4046,1195,16149,3869,1208,16578,294,22827,52309,266,13,5034,55133,3488,7930,513,17477,1826,27058,62998,42067,23496,84,11,4635,84,951,3600,409,4379,11,5019,951,86696,326,8362,1354,6033,5019,274,93825,18336,69068,11,43989,57375,44093,665,22848,978,949,1952,3567,72,408,14687,39587,8818,17194,33670,27584,294,49152,13603,945,72,732,17771,665,16968,4865,6316,23423,8047,961,351,8047,1370,653,6800,13026,409,3613,275,2303,729,1880,409,12155,4294,4893,3435,8467,11,7930,4263,306,1880,4046,14717,69625,3625,781,285,13,19421,272,17771,3846,7930,1120,57609,326,31769,1195,29355,1880,514,82620,11,41199,514,83259,3930,30388,68,97739,9326,11,409,42067,704,321,16422,307,2428,9721,519,934,17771,326,6,13885,16597,93549,44698,13,2009,64079,281,10610,278,841,513,71080,5636,45575,70374,3869,45361,1215,11,10071,44767,3869,21945,466,3625,82134,52962,3808,3869,46932,265,8231,39904,7364,3869,7364,294,31109,34501,65461,60224,3869,6316,34501,20862,64829,13,356,13059,519,11,653,38847,1826,3869,70375,5019,1370,3716,556,514,82620,409,3846,32118,4919,44618,13,5034,5790,263,5979,367,409,12155,97222,21901,2908,12249,8065,9859,409,1208,11347,265,36959,68,77463,88661,361,5253,83,379,74533,5392,788,9517,301,1001,550,5615,2641,949,356,17771,49733,1744,11083,58673,2249,864,7521,306,2035,13,445,41901,3841,84,1826,294,31769,74199,404,6316,76680,30303,46680,46140,90053,409,326,6,13885,16597,93549,44698,11,1208,7591,5589,404,11,4046,2470,52424,26077,645,49276,5247,14848,7010,3846,60697,11,14240,664,1291,28130,3851,95234,1880,665,7591,23827,261,43153,57705,978,2889,8467,13,1611,39015,11,4864,5019,41098,4046,6414,3913,62321,1880,12108,26077,645,15132,3625,4017,288,73083,3916,7930,841,56311,1880,76776,841,97569,23761,704,265,6519,14014,7010,326,6,19010,4422,367,409,3846,955,294,6,13885,16597,74687,15878,9517,12287,290,1765,3846,70927,11,7010,326,6,5389,404,11,326,6,13885,16597,93549,44698,92215,23761,16898,30885,8047,9952,6316,79036,409,6667,68,665,58617,409,12155,46681,1880,409,12155,17320,17274,645,665,48234,294,31769,74199,404,5019,95917,359,294,6,40997,17317,85114,2848,8839,3869,10025,593,13,41621,326,26248,554,89,13550,285,11,11083,58673,2249,274,6,1354,5192,81541,39587,7010,6316,8335,738,5048,9465,9517,4099,1880,22848,978,13,5034,22848,978,11,5019,93224,554,11,14240,519,1208,67239,978,5019,95917,359,294,6,40997,17317,409,5293,261,3869,326,6,19010,4422,367,951,47371,4144,82,951,6155,1673,288,7930,274,6,77196,72684,546,1880,274,98279,20672,546,3869,17317,7010,326,6,5389,404,3587,68,9189,312,1195,25134,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,32,36815,35271,22755,922,279,7434,315,330,13885,16597,93549,44698,1,320,44297,369,330,8322,575,5382,16750,909,323,1202,25127,389,3927,11542,323,4868,627,198,791,19114,12302,555,77724,264,3938,8396,1405,1070,374,912,810,9349,11,9977,11,477,24020,11,323,1268,420,1436,387,17427,1555,459,16961,5382,47426,1887,430,6276,11527,311,55579,1603,264,4754,4225,16597,13980,13,1115,7434,374,539,502,11,439,433,706,1027,14407,304,279,2317,315,24955,10039,40241,2191,11,1405,7931,527,45487,3196,389,872,4754,5326,4856,1109,5150,7865,627,198,791,19114,8554,430,1418,420,1253,2873,1093,8198,17422,11,1070,527,2736,12195,315,420,9327,304,6617,8396,11,8104,304,279,15508,315,20320,8951,13,578,3488,374,9408,922,3249,7931,889,617,1027,3967,311,5379,9099,17073,477,6
