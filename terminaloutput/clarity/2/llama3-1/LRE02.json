It's a transcript of a geologist structuralist discussing their thesis about an extinct volcano called the Piton des Neiges, which has been dormant for over 20,000 years. The speaker is excited to explore the insides of this giant and uncover its secrets.\n\nThe text starts by describing the majesty of volcanoes, emphasizing that even though they're not immortal, they still have a lot to teach us. The speaker then introduces themselves as a geologist structuralist and explains their goal: to study the anatomy of an extinct volcano, specifically the Piton des Neiges.\n\nTo do this, the speaker will be walking miles of trails to create a geological map of the area, examining rocks and fractures, and conducting additional tests to determine the age and composition of the rocks. This process will allow them to reconstruct the volcano's history over the past million years, including its constructions and destructions.\n\nHowever, the speaker's real focus is on the fractures within the volcano, which they see as zones of weakness that can lead to landslides and rockfalls. They're interested in determining whether these fractures have been properly repaired or not.\n\nThe second part of their thesis will involve using geothermal energy to detect if hot water or steam is present beneath the surface. This could potentially lead to the discovery of a vast network of channels filled with hot water, which could be harnessed to generate electricity.\n\nThroughout the text, the speaker's passion and excitement are palpable, making it engaging to read. The use of vivid imagery and metaphors adds to the narrative's charm, drawing the reader into the world of geology and the thrill of discovery.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,11876,4499,66,598,15132,951,20183,45632,409,82711,13,11842,11,757,15550,86396,11,17317,15550,86396,13,34447,27750,4499,66,598,841,15132,6502,4998,371,2053,13,81245,1913,79738,84440,28463,1370,67683,404,13,11842,6502,294,22827,2961,49530,3786,689,593,11,10071,96308,294,22827,4043,283,544,1001,409,28130,272,89412,11,1208,30584,375,4983,8637,2428,13,6178,72,11,4864,36731,74672,77828,24693,17194,11,1880,514,719,409,7643,270,4558,325,1826,409,7591,23827,261,326,62595,22612,648,294,22827,36373,10237,1880,665,45369,409,7591,77907,13,24703,36373,11,272,17771,514,20428,263,951,841,52763,11,1880,45602,20272,5636,409,220,508,220,931,8261,934,35329,274,17771,4046,668,396,1880,1207,275,409,84871,57625,295,3625,528,3342,978,4108,13,43987,26178,1744,15907,1344,1149,82,15132,1922,355,5512,1370,3625,30570,14295,11,3625,26564,22626,1218,64,484,14014,1370,3625,436,33920,31539,11,1880,1744,3625,50510,15081,409,51655,513,3381,436,5518,11,41091,11,38920,10237,6853,11,296,6,833,283,544,265,7010,3625,11751,87455,409,3846,74672,519,13,8290,68,2933,1880,326,13649,665,1925,11,19227,653,32118,8332,258,9952,4538,357,978,339,63753,11,503,6,12119,93113,68,3625,938,8696,3930,20428,263,951,841,52763,13,7695,296,6,1138,535,294,6,31830,951,78332,11,47289,6489,625,1154,409,38546,35205,22761,288,7930,523,3042,11206,306,326,6,23156,409,1647,8893,1880,4684,5118,306,1647,15439,13,36684,58673,2249,13263,7010,653,21134,27138,3869,45740,414,404,951,15395,316,75104,409,3288,4918,54401,294,31769,74199,404,6316,48454,951,938,8696,1880,951,78332,30179,21938,46206,1647,8893,13,356,17771,3846,934,54386,917,6853,1208,7558,3257,648,74672,1640,2428,13,622,6,27153,361,44767,951,7151,729,4684,42625,17724,54401,409,7591,23827,261,1208,18528,951,938,8696,1744,503,34155,779,19388,43765,71132,77,14014,11,10071,28463,28130,29005,713,11,77433,3869,951,24654,8065,73757,1880,951,29060,38094,8467,19219,380,5118,14014,13,350,788,27750,15285,757,29557,73468,44351,409,312,1040,275,8977,6316,3610,294,6,1036,14014,294,6,90446,409,3846,92622,20428,263,951,841,52763,11,15907,96939,1880,15907,19814,82,13,34447,19443,2439,10253,78332,11,66021,1744,3625,78332,11,272,17771,7643,76305,13109,13,11876,78332,15132,951,26467,409,2267,21041,325,11,8508,121038,519,3625,4499,66,598,13,356,17771,294,6,52009,1759,84568,7930,15132,3869,326,6,4775,483,951,4046,65,11206,285,1880,951,2840,15760,1392,409,25911,13,7695,1826,39587,3062,409,47929,4502,27750,78332,513,15132,14707,9517,1768,14014,11,14707,1400,8637,14014,13,2998,20272,11,2536,1120,1133,11,66021,1744,4864,36731,74672,77828,24693,17194,13,19421,7930,22011,24693,17194,22011,6070,22011,59904,13,19421,39587,3625,78332,6502,14707,9517,1768,14014,11,272,17771,1120,1133,3846,7930,296,55624,978,22550,13,14465,841,36731,39587,6502,32118,8332,258,11,39587,4864,841,52571,6502,3869,3625,779,78756,11,10071,3869,47929,4502,653,490,5512,269,274,59858,6636,13,34447,26077,25692,14707,23761,3846,490,5512,269,1765,653,36373,4046,668,396,76190,978,514,20428,263,951,841,52763,949,5034,523,61047,11,4046,1325,336,479,13,356,17771,96308,326,93847,13826,799,11,3869,83195,13510,13,5034,74672,1605,74696,409,4538,46110,9859,13,34447,20662,384,2933,13826,799,11,4068,47929,4502,27549,274,59858,6636,9517,301,1001,949,356,17771,39015,16968,326,41901,3841,84,409,1208,26633,90272,48901,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,14465,91507,2515,8977,6316,4046,331,3257,648,514,1317,409,20662,270,4558,325,13,2998,66517,519,45347,653,37194,98151,34395,7010,514,2092,11,5019,47929,4502,951,15962,288,70412,82,6033,4170,5512,8065,30945,437,274,59858,61387,306,13,2998,294,81979,4751,288,11,503,6,26577,648,409,47929,4502,3625,78332,3930,20428,263,951,841,52763,841,75164,6502,11,665,59157,13109,11,653,348,5642,98947,409,649,35965,811,69241,285,294,93847,13826,799,11,8065,19910,3930,43014,3900,87264,3284,294,6,27153,8977,653,369,425,11,5019,20028,1323,263,466,20662,384,2933,13826,799,665,7479,11,5019,2558,556,409,326,31769,47262,13109,13,41621,326,26248,554,89,13550,285,11,11083,67,986,1880,9622,46138,11,4864,841,91507,78705,55755,6502,17459,261,326,93847,13826,799,11,10071,503,34155,56321,8261,5019,4043,1155,409,1208,46524,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,27387,1495,0,1102,596,264,36815,315,264,3980,16549,24693,380,25394,872,17850,922,459,69918,66306,2663,279,40079,263,951,4275,52763,11,902,706,1027,89460,369,927,220,508,11,931,1667,13,578,19114,374,12304,311,13488,279,1672,3422,315,420,14880,323,45063,1202,24511,627,198,791,1495,8638,555,23524,279,24906,41339,315,36373,7217,11,82003,430,1524,3582,814,2351,539,60214,11,814,2103,617,264,2763,311,4639,603,13,578,19114,1243,40019,5694,439,264,3980,16549,24693,380,323,15100,872,5915,25,311,4007,279,62690,315,459,69918,66306,11,11951,279,40079,263,951,4275,52763,627,198,1271,656,420,11,279,19114,690,387,11689,8931,315,33965,311,1893,264,86278,2472,315,279,3158,11,38936,23902,323,78332,11,323,31474,5217,7177,311,8417,279,432
