The speaker describes a hypothetical scenario where parents have access to various professionals who cater to their needs, including a private chauffeur, bodyguard, stylist, chef, and banker.\n\nThe speaker highlights how societal expectations place a heavy burden on parents, expecting them to always be happy and fulfilled. However, the reality is that being a parent can be exhausting, leading to burnout in many cases. The speaker notes that research shows that parents are more likely to experience burnout than business executives.\n\nThe goal of the speaker's work as a psychologist is to predict and prevent parental burnout by providing support and resources to help parents manage stress, cultivate mindfulness, and develop emotional regulation skills. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, the speaker uses hair samples (specifically, cortisol levels in hair) to measure the impact on parents' overall well-being.\n\nOverall, the presentation aims to raise awareness about the importance of supporting parents and recognizing their experiences, rather than simply blaming them for society's problems.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,38891,89,653,11159,1370,543,51453,7010,514,43014,9189,26725,28490,89,294,22827,74817,12844,6223,978,11,294,22827,22641,3675,3930,34922,11,294,22827,18078,65746,11,294,22827,31547,258,1291,7930,27389,3462,5019,9189,26725,26317,628,1900,27389,69,14081,5512,1880,294,22827,9120,33571,22176,64,7930,17452,26317,22040,1441,3625,5636,282,788,1880,7930,513,27389,14310,86577,1744,9189,779,9188,89,44093,77818,2249,13,356,295,11159,11,76190,2439,31307,326,41901,69,685,13,19421,40744,27750,48577,64555,17724,11,76190,2439,12,645,6699,13,4241,9425,951,35881,2734,552,11,3625,8841,1640,1157,14848,84788,72,3869,17780,8977,1208,4294,87782,409,16968,514,8811,383,324,3930,38900,10253,6699,13,356,13059,519,11,25945,28800,409,76305,75460,274,55624,978,676,306,3869,4068,3625,6699,11,84440,11,18434,306,28130,46679,13109,13,46706,29449,7829,11,3900,379,264,6316,1651,6960,5019,1744,1208,46679,13109,45441,44093,13,39783,88411,6928,13,11876,60120,6699,312,20822,81541,951,503,337,552,7558,288,11,951,58482,6154,811,1880,84871,409,86696,78418,12249,296,625,2439,13,11876,60404,15132,16265,8839,11,39587,3625,6699,3567,969,1188,23761,3625,5636,77818,2249,3930,38900,13,356,8458,1826,83195,11,10071,6502,16968,514,27138,13,2998,59157,13109,11,23761,2748,11,39043,36709,13,64105,64,36709,3869,19227,1486,1744,409,5636,665,5636,409,33820,598,1880,409,26365,300,308,6,1138,81541,5636,3869,513,75802,88778,5512,13,81245,274,31769,652,285,306,13,5034,38317,20605,265,27584,934,85217,274,31769,652,285,306,5636,1744,3625,53542,294,82405,17724,13,41621,62299,6350,285,949,9424,688,11,3625,6699,84440,1474,5615,9004,841,11427,306,6502,934,85217,5945,544,8135,409,8395,9994,46679,13,11876,1615,978,45045,409,8395,9994,46679,15132,25945,19266,85,31539,13,12623,409,83977,1220,11,5636,409,4738,2436,11,5636,409,38605,6200,343,2436,1880,409,8811,30532,3095,13,350,519,5019,326,41901,61827,11,3625,21961,11,3625,2138,31355,1218,59307,13,3206,436,57332,665,37622,1744,8841,77828,6824,68,3869,550,15433,556,13,19421,3869,27389,43406,326,53149,9425,1133,951,6699,13,62293,11083,4631,4558,70,1157,11,17317,57038,390,79884,653,18629,409,27389,7611,7930,348,1082,3869,2579,263,1215,10253,6699,409,1208,274,14081,10610,13109,11,3930,60020,11,409,1208,24617,13,33150,45369,294,6,84426,4918,11,503,6,57379,3625,6699,3869,917,9484,265,951,12823,409,59471,3930,8631,11,409,7245,483,42563,11,409,59471,951,4046,76,41356,61907,3742,13,34447,4068,47929,1744,1647,21623,1826,31914,580,949,61651,14707,11,4864,57625,4618,7010,1208,83067,951,6699,13,41621,5019,7379,89,9189,13510,11,12769,11876,8841,1640,1157,11,39587,11,272,17771,4725,13,8345,34447,4864,1239,42441,28463,43153,3091,588,2249,13,27058,4046,838,8977,326,6,6581,292,582,13109,409,20662,21623,11,4864,28130,550,19010,79351,951,98385,296,4558,8696,409,3091,588,2249,33670,1880,3869,1208,1913,3930,18629,5019,93455,514,9637,2249,409,89942,2107,6374,556,11,75467,324,3930,8631,27076,2428,11,1880,10484,3125,326,58591,73511,7769,409,28130,14240,266,409,77323,1880,409,14707,85815,13,1952,308,53149,9484,6502,3869,326,31769,56745,3869,23761,653,7970,2748,13,24703,87264,951,14707,21965,1317,1157,14240,29246,11,25692,85815,27584,4225,258,552,13,356,17771,87320,7010,11083,58673,2249,11,503,6,434,61055,409,46524,951,10105,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5084,1093,499,3984,264,36815,315,264,8982,477,15864,555,264,54595,389,279,8712,315,46679,8395,412,323,279,12939,315,12899,6699,304,872,3560,13,578,19114,16964,264,59159,15398,1405,6699,617,2680,311,5370,15749,889,29068,311,872,3966,11,2737,264,879,74817,12844,11,2547,27190,11,67473,11,30806,11,323,72759,627,198,791,19114,22020,1268,59529,17078,2035,264,8987,23104,389,6699,11,23132,1124,311,2744,387,6380,323,41834,13,4452,11,279,8903,374,430,1694,264,2748,649,387,79953,11,6522,311,8395,412,304,1690,5157,13,578,19114,8554,430,3495,5039,430,6699,527,810,4461,311,3217,8395,412,1109,2626,29509,627,198,791,5915,315,279,19114,596,990,439,264,54595,374,311,7168,323,5471,46679,8395,412,555,8405,1862,323,5070,311,1520,6699,10299,8631,11,67632,71705,11,323,2274,14604,19812,7512,13,2057,15806,279,27375,315,420,5603,11,279,19114,5829,7013,10688,320,52340,750,11,89942,5990,304,7013,8,311,6767,279,5536,389,6699,6,8244,1664,33851,627,198,28589,11,279,15864,22262,311,4933,17985,922,279,12939,315,12899,6699,323,49183,872,11704,11,4856,1109,5042,59771,1124,369,8396,596,5435,13,128009],"total_duration":8243775677,"load_duration":199335,"prompt_eval_count":672,"prompt_eval_duration":1327264000,"eval_count":230,"eval_duration":6915876000}
