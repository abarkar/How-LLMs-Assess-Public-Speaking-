The speaker is an engineer who is developing a new numerical tool to predict the threshold of tolerance and point of rupture for these materials.\n\nThe text begins by asking if the audience has ever seen a material that becomes fatigued or worn out. The speaker notes that while some materials do not fatigue, others can become exhausted and eventually fail when they reach their tolerance limit.\n\nThe engineer then explains that they are working on developing an innovative tool that uses chemical physical and mechanical equations to model the behavior of materials at different scales, from micrometers to meters. This allows them to predict when cracks or fissures will appear in a material and become dangerous before a catastrophic failure occurs.\n\nThroughout the text, the speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding the fatigue and failure mechanisms of materials in order to ensure the safety and reliability of automotive components. The text appears to be a presentation or lecture given by an engineer to an audience interested in materials science and engineering.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,362,19610,45325,46939,33614,653,5634,28154,2933,7930,274,31769,1215,588,30,41621,12584,89,757,13510,653,5634,28154,2933,841,274,31769,1215,588,6502,30,507,2005,13,423,69537,541,13,34447,3846,1744,4864,5320,2249,13510,934,41901,20272,653,5634,28154,2933,37953,447,80720,93381,396,4538,20607,321,409,39674,14081,685,3869,653,3738,4545,11,3900,92215,274,6,9600,3212,22299,17317,11,3625,20183,45632,2854,1771,13,6178,72,1370,51173,11,3900,379,264,653,4545,8065,1647,20607,321,409,39674,14081,685,1826,93381,396,11,4864,36709,11,4864,296,31769,1215,588,1880,503,308,6,4683,1497,13,1252,5634,28154,2933,3900,274,6,9600,547,28463,11,3900,513,36709,1880,3900,513,5052,97717,13,34447,87320,4864,9189,1370,273,409,16968,39043,30,4366,346,1744,41091,503,57286,664,648,11,4864,52895,375,653,35462,704,321,1661,78129,7930,757,29557,409,27389,35573,514,20607,321,409,39674,14081,685,1880,514,1486,409,89869,294,22827,43453,5634,28154,2933,7930,31605,2473,514,10095,265,1880,1208,60172,951,4160,42204,409,18111,324,13,46706,514,9511,67763,39723,4864,42775,273,11,934,17771,54312,1744,4864,66517,30,622,6,15824,285,653,46110,4411,346,2933,409,3846,5634,28154,2933,1880,4864,514,66517,18434,265,7010,653,50026,40280,39723,9189,45366,9189,38831,15170,9952,15265,81645,7010,76076,21935,11,653,951,281,3946,326,6,28400,307,13109,13,4418,66,4864,296,1441,7010,326,93847,1880,1744,20272,326,93847,30,5034,4160,321,6496,7930,8175,265,11,27549,281,46651,1880,27549,281,46651,13,19421,1744,20272,514,5634,28154,2933,30,7695,31807,17194,11,3900,308,41901,25692,5636,13,393,9425,3900,93381,396,272,729,978,409,409,39674,14081,685,13,19421,8065,25646,294,22827,3738,4545,11,3900,46141,593,11,4864,91507,13510,3900,18111,97717,11,6033,96308,3900,5568,8065,9314,97717,66021,1744,39043,841,513,4160,275,6502,13,19421,272,17771,3846,1744,503,57286,664,648,1208,42723,97717,11,66021,1744,326,6,31258,1744,4864,52895,375,757,29557,2221,294,6,14283,3869,6316,4046,331,6853,25945,38920,409,326,6,541,265,409,19748,442,99746,54401,409,757,7591,68019,26725,27750,1156,10610,10308,409,84364,13,34447,9604,10333,11,3900,308,59858,264,6502,1744,39043,7010,1208,17536,11,66021,934,41901,5636,409,326,6,28400,307,13109,409,11323,266,11,9189,6033,85,23577,9189,18728,1195,15265,60172,13,41621,6033,85,23577,9189,18728,1195,15265,10095,265,13,41621,6033,85,23577,9189,18728,1195,15265,60172,13,41621,6033,85,23577,9189,18728,1195,15265,10095,265,1880,503,6,283,49606,13,14465,18728,2727,1880,503,6,283,49606,11,4864,18728,2727,1880,503,6,283,49606,11,4864,18728,2727,1880,503,6,283,49606,11,4864,18728,2727,1880,503,6,283,49606,11,4864,18728,2727,1880,503,6,283,49606,13,14465,18728,2727,13,426,1116,11,9189,326,65496,9189,514,36709,89,13,19421,39015,3625,95159,1439,1081,27462,3869,513,46131,13,19421,1208,1913,308,17771,6502,25945,78060,13,1708,1105,4068,20028,30,356,17771,39015,1744,1208,26633,90272,48901,409,1647,704,321,86953,1188,9952,3625,4046,447,811,409,1208,38094,648,64441,1880,32118,4919,2428,1744,4864,1491,19010,1082,7010,1647,1515,78493,13,14465,94297,45347,409,326,31769,331,6853,8162,2445,454,2428,3869,326,31769,331,6853,8162,2445,454,2428,54401,409,27389,35573,3869,26077,4545,3625,95159,1439,7930,3073,306,294,31109,76407,304,118904,15729,7010,653,5634,28154,2933,3567,26584,58612,486,4881,33670,934,22827,1377,373,841,513,2558,1082,13,4366,346,1744,41091,11,4864,5320,2249,1744,39043,1913,275,14707,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,791,36815,8111,311,387,264,8753,1495,430,35434,279,36709,323,8060,315,7384,11,8104,304,279,2317,315,40508,6956,1778,439,14365,323,490,15655,13,578,19114,374,459,24490,889,374,11469,264,502,35876,5507,311,7168,279,12447,315,25065,323,1486,315,89869,369,1521,7384,627,198,791,1495,12302,555,10371,422,279,10877,706,3596,3970,264,3769,430,9221,8834,343,3340,477,24634,704,13,578,19114,8554,430,1418,1063,7384,656,539,36709,11,3885,649,3719,39019,323,9778,3775,994,814,5662,872,25065,4017,627,198,791,24490,1243,15100,430,814,527,3318,389,11469,459,18699,5507,430,5829,11742,7106,323,22936,39006,311,1646,279,7865,315,7384,520,2204,29505,11,505,19748,442,2481,311,20645,13,1115,6276,1124,311,7168,994,45963,477,95159,1439,690,5101,304,264,3769,323,3719,11660,1603,264,54677,8060,13980,627,198,60105,279,1495,11,279,19114,66159,279,12939,315,8830,279,36709,323,8060,24717,315,7384,304,2015,311,6106,279,7296,323,31638,315,40508,6956,13,578,1495,8111,311,387,264,15864,477,31678,2728,555,459,24490,311,459,10877,8173,304,7384,8198,323,15009,13,128009],"total_duration":8021344949,"load_duration":202482,"prompt_eval_count":706,"prompt_eval_duration":1435425000,"eval_count":219,"eval_duration":6585112000}
