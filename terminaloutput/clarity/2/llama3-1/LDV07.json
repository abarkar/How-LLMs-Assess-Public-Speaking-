It mentions how the development of pigeons' wings to steel, and the creation of air postal services, have enabled faster communication. Today, satellites transmit messages worldwide, and tomorrow, they will allow for direct access to the internet from anywhere on Earth.\n\n**Transcript**\n\nThe transcript appears to be a conversation between Antoine de Saint-Exupéry (author of \"Le Petit Prince\") and his wife Consuela. Antoine is stranded in the Sahara Desert and uses FaceTime to communicate with Consuela, who is elsewhere. He seeks advice from André, another acquaintance, on how to fix a technical issue with his device.\n\nThe conversation then jumps forward in time to Antoine being helped by André to repair his device using 3D printing technology. This allows him to return to Paris and develop new projects.\n\nThe main theme of the conversation appears to be the need for efficient communication and resource management, particularly in areas with high demand. The speaker mentions that their research involves developing a device that can optimize the use of available resources, reducing waste and increasing efficiency.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe transcript concludes with the speaker reflecting on the importance of making communication accessible to all, citing the current statistic that only half of the world's population has access to the internet. The goal is to make it universally accessible in the future.\n\nOverall, the text combines elements of science fiction, technology, and communication theory, using Antoine de Saint-Exupéry as a character to explore these themes.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,1611,16968,27138,11,326,6,87713,264,23008,75117,3869,1380,4150,10367,951,6743,3869,30517,4538,7317,6491,556,13,19421,100198,11,514,12088,301,3567,396,653,35174,3869,6155,9769,1565,7010,3846,719,13,11876,264,3742,951,50455,2439,45640,1759,3567,258,8135,294,6,54553,13,19421,3846,18111,1208,25626,264,46043,409,326,26248,978,897,537,1604,13,362,9832,77492,88253,11,17317,17317,74533,4046,76,1149,575,5512,409,326,6,266,8801,764,12339,2024,4014,265,1880,12155,47710,1380,4150,73468,12155,6743,961,412,7010,514,38900,13,4829,467,11,46152,17317,29557,376,546,653,1046,12416,2167,3869,8191,11,41199,308,6,94896,26077,1486,3930,24867,13,77533,258,2439,653,46110,28800,3846,1744,45602,71751,1339,13,91254,409,14539,12,849,455,125949,274,31769,5192,521,7010,514,46838,531,3930,89078,13,1708,1105,934,35329,513,3288,14707,5636,13399,978,934,22827,93562,34298,978,8065,83259,409,326,6,511,978,276,11,3900,274,6,391,652,37093,3869,274,6,408,494,404,1765,514,274,481,11,42676,11,16968,3869,16081,11,6316,38920,4538,1215,648,513,20272,69379,265,13,356,17771,7440,24669,11,829,18694,11,7930,25400,30714,653,19109,1489,13,356,17771,653,28800,22299,653,4632,13,423,5512,337,978,11,7643,16392,11,4864,841,5019,41098,6502,23761,57485,3846,57992,13,622,34155,15925,653,63828,1414,10672,15105,13,9589,54312,934,6,3112,43711,1826,9952,76420,949,622,6,4202,2852,14707,63669,409,15907,92980,13,85900,11,1239,42441,11,1647,35872,44486,461,1880,1647,5817,376,283,1331,69,537,11067,15132,26725,73354,462,447,5512,7010,326,22827,409,326,49455,265,13,356,17771,16968,281,39883,1880,4864,841,94297,6502,7591,17666,261,13,9589,54312,1744,9964,439,653,31025,321,3869,757,71751,949,2895,66096,8065,31025,321,15105,294,6,3112,43711,11,91254,264,24560,47281,409,54606,1215,3869,3765,307,23685,13,7695,379,264,100162,6316,737,18375,5048,220,18,35,7930,25400,264,14175,285,409,43116,42556,4538,100007,13,7695,264,39587,7591,21200,978,409,20028,653,46494,44829,409,9765,462,16339,3625,70477,1634,15890,3900,50590,63669,5019,54606,1215,3869,12366,13,80905,830,30148,11,3869,3765,307,23685,11,3900,379,264,48488,5636,294,49963,285,36306,90053,409,25400,1744,7010,514,46838,531,3930,89078,13,7695,1826,39587,100243,5019,514,24088,294,6,283,63346,51854,649,12249,409,10758,1880,409,97448,1208,10484,13109,409,46681,70720,9465,15907,85114,603,11467,13,1952,25692,44767,49806,261,1208,10484,13109,2458,1604,409,46681,70720,665,28068,519,1765,1208,95138,409,1448,978,4474,682,283,8047,10253,43116,44410,7010,1208,10353,13,356,8458,513,20272,16968,830,30148,8065,7591,14928,13,356,17771,514,7591,376,3904,951,26467,24894,288,13,19421,272,17771,16968,514,70927,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,51223,543,283,261,1208,594,2484,55852,39015,39723,389,264,63669,294,41901,834,20672,13,5034,48416,8977,7010,3625,46838,15916,11,7010,3625,18274,978,598,11,1208,85434,11,5019,326,6,19729,479,261,514,9880,7010,3625,26467,25945,1069,455,75,14014,13,33150,9511,67763,11,17317,58673,484,2439,3869,326,26248,579,294,98279,18375,15844,220,18,35,7930,17317,29557,73468,951,25492,409,82620,409,5636,665,5636,19359,13,14465,94297,39587,20245,35573,100198,951,47728,3930,58551,333,1765,514,43014,4864,42775,273,7930,42182,2800,261,3869,1208,37291,63828,1414,1880,17251,13,14465,94297,20245,35573,6316,2373,409,1647,58551,333,665,6316,72709,11,326,98279,48670,1208,72709,46932,5048,1880,514,11083,7889,1208,72709,294,6,60917,12416,13,2998,653,46415,11,503,34155,86595,978,653,25018,13,33150,45369,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,503,34155,44351,18757,38211,96642,2671,11,96642,67239,5512,1880,326,31109,294,6,40997,84568,264,24560,2126,27476,8047,409,94499,11,757,29557,61512,409,31659,1208,10484,13109,409,46681,1370,56321,9465,26633,14240,1900,12742,82,13,362,9832,77492,88253,7010,514,38900,11,86806,6316,54613,1765,26633,264,1046,12416,3869,8191,13,19421,2486,467,11,17317,16948,978,26692,39929,17634,84,15987,3869,26725,3846,12111,294,31769,3455,13,14465,9189,93569,13,622,34155,3930,42775,3869,13390,404,1880,7643,16392,296,6,57558,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5992,1093,499,3077,11093,1403,22755,25,459,17219,311,279,7057,315,10758,323,264,36815,315,264,10652,627,198,8586,596,856,4879,520,15061,1523,279,8970,1473,9,9,38255,334,198,198,791,1495,8638,555,39686,279,12939,315,78768,6743,4028,39543,11,505,14154,3115,311,6617,2919,13,1102,34945,1268,279,4500,315,50455,2439,6,27296,311,9699,11,323,279,9886,315,3805,40854,3600,11,617,9147,10819,10758,13,11450,11,47710,30382,6743,15603,11,323,16986,11,814,690,2187,369,2167,2680,311,279,7757,505,12660,389,9420,382,9,9,3246,1250,334,198,198,791,36815,8111,311,387,264,10652,1990,91254,409,14539,12,849,455,125949,320,3170,315,330,2356,92917,19912,909,323,813,7555,7440,24669,13,91254,374,63205,304,279,89078,43286,323,5829,19109,1489,311,19570,449,7440,24669,11,889,374,18403,13,1283,26737,9650,505,85900,11,2500,82407,11,389,1268,311,5155,264,11156,4360,449,813,3756,627,198,791,10652,1243,35308,474
