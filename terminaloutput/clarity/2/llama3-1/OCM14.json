Three cities, three examples of cities severely affected by terrorist attacks caused by so-called radicalization. So, in the face of this threat, public authorities in France have set up plans to fight against radicalization but which globally lack functionality. Why? That's one aspect I'm dealing with in my thesis and that we're going to see together. The objective of this thesis is to be able to give functionality and effectiveness back to these plans. So what's wrong with the notion of radicalization since it's what's causing the problem? First, it has no structure, neither legal nor scientific. For example, in my thesis, I looked at the national plan for preventing radicalization published by the government in 2018. And you can see that word \"radicalization\" used 112 times without ever defining what it means. As a result, you're free to interpret this notion however you like. That's it. That's the first point. Secondly, the notion of radicalization disqualifies. It accuses. And by doing so, it adds more emotion, more sensation, and never any sense. That's the second point. And the third point is that... The notion of radicalization does not distinguish well between what is moral and what is legal. If a woman wants to wear a hijab, one day you can suspect her of being radicalized or Islamist. But does she have the legal right to do so? Yes. So accusing someone of doing something legally allowed, that's suspicious. What can we do? First, we need to give more responsibility to the notion of radicalization. Reference to law because law is identifiable, morality is not. I can find a legal text, but not a moral one. Then, we can't leave on the same plan and with the same term the radicalization of someone who might be going to war and another person who is just living in... That's not possible. And then, we need to change our way of defining things. Talking about radicalization is too vague. Talking about violent activism is more precise. Talking about Salafism doesn't teach us anything. Talking about an isolationist group is clearer. And finally, we absolutely must stop trying to mobilize symbols as a means to parade. Fighting against radicalization with big words and Republic flags is very nice but means nothing. So in the end, Albert Camus was right. Misnaming things adds more trouble to the world. I'm not claiming to bring more happiness with this thesis, I hope for a bit more security. And that would make me happy.]\n\nNote: The speaker appears to be presenting their research on radicalization and its implications for counter-terrorism strategies in France. They criticize the concept of radicalization for being vague, accusatory, and lacking a clear definition. They argue that it is important to move away from moralizing language and focus on legal frameworks instead.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,25048,11,80693,417,1880,12366,13,19881,285,26886,645,11,56321,94320,645,409,26886,645,1448,680,14014,294,39346,1370,951,52309,1900,20320,288,53532,3869,3846,934,54386,917,6853,1208,18336,8082,13,1708,1105,3663,3869,20662,81695,11,3625,17258,3415,17260,586,82,665,9822,14848,5906,665,2035,951,6787,409,63922,668,45973,1208,18336,8082,10071,7930,13509,54960,893,17187,409,34501,43078,13109,13,27058,62998,949,356,17771,326,22827,951,13878,1744,4864,9781,635,7010,7643,270,4558,325,1880,1744,17317,682,2439,46131,40126,13,445,6,1735,333,409,20662,270,4558,325,272,17771,409,68226,2579,263,1215,34501,43078,13109,1880,31914,582,13109,3869,27750,6787,13,1708,1105,934,17771,54312,7930,841,11412,6502,9952,1208,23035,409,18336,8082,44829,593,272,17771,27549,7930,1826,665,5353,949,423,6,370,541,11,27549,308,26248,6502,409,6070,11,13080,16422,307,2428,11,13080,7330,52760,13,4366,51173,11,7010,514,60697,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,757,36731,92759,978,8065,3197,5426,409,27389,7611,409,1208,18336,8082,78511,978,665,220,679,23,1370,514,85182,40280,13,19421,3869,220,7261,312,26500,11,389,25692,379,46131,514,3937,18336,8082,10071,6502,6316,86806,37291,3846,1744,39043,76605,13510,13,432,5512,495,266,11,9189,62299,48647,294,6,2295,652,978,466,20662,23035,22299,7970,9189,97487,13,29179,321,6496,13,64105,64,272,17771,514,21134,1486,13,1611,2249,72,111908,1133,11,1208,23035,409,18336,8082,11,27549,841,5965,57609,6502,13,46408,834,1788,57609,13,46408,62742,13,19421,665,66517,519,45602,11,27549,26514,2182,44093,5636,409,63683,11,44093,5636,294,6,17060,6082,11,44093,5636,409,37392,11,44093,5636,409,37392,65268,13,34447,56316,5636,11,1880,272,17771,39015,514,10045,1744,503,34155,293,19395,352,978,10071,514,10045,1826,3062,66090,2922,6496,11,272,17771,56316,5636,409,6225,13,64105,64,272,17771,514,26633,90272,1486,13,19421,514,8348,13532,25253,1486,272,17771,1744,1131,5034,23035,409,18336,8082,11,27549,1612,287,361,25945,8811,3846,7930,1826,16033,409,3846,7930,1826,63828,16876,13,12095,6316,18694,409,1925,76605,88286,514,40884,569,11,3930,9880,8065,39580,93658,11,389,5019,969,1208,15562,261,409,18336,8082,11,409,18336,44618,6033,294,6,23265,309,44618,11,28800,1179,68,13,27058,3154,519,11,264,2442,12,6853,514,64079,63828,43310,409,514,20028,11,409,514,88286,949,507,2005,13,4418,66,15562,261,26077,447,22827,409,20028,79071,14896,409,63828,16876,11,39043,11,272,17771,15562,13,1708,1105,934,17771,54312,934,54386,25692,20028,949,423,6,370,541,11,3900,47090,71751,3869,1208,23035,409,18336,8082,6316,5636,25626,4294,87782,13,5034,91558,16271,8065,64079,11,66021,1744,514,64079,1826,72450,11,1208,63683,841,326,17771,6502,13,14465,94297,23008,9211,653,69067,409,64079,11,4864,94297,6502,23008,9211,653,69067,409,63683,13,2998,51092,11,389,841,25692,6502,1208,74333,1765,653,27584,3197,11,1880,9952,653,27584,98020,11,1208,18336,8082,11,6316,54613,7930,87264,48901,20028,1208,1709,67100,11,1880,6316,47838,7930,513,2322,30532,3869,18434,265,665,3941,1131,356,17771,6502,3284,13,19421,44829,11,3900,47090,62439,29449,85722,409,7591,5589,404,3625,79165,13,4366,1565,409,18336,8082,11,272,17771,21965,40146,13,4366,1565,294,6,9035,44618,16806,11,272,17771,5636,51625,285,13,4366,1565,409,4371,2642,44618,841,17317,917,9484,55455,13,4366,1565,409,57951,31398,77,17194,11,65268,11,1826,5636,1206,1334,13,19421,44829,11,3900,47090,88661,1143,272,37470,409,55162,385,404,29905,12329,951,8045,754,645,22299,91116,409,37604,13,445,6339,45973,1208,18336,8082,3869,6800,16081,409,51223,9780,37526,11,272,17771,25945,503,14559,11,10071,39043,841,76605,55455,13510,13,1708,1105,1913,54960,11,17971,8215,355,50590,73173,13,65381,8811,9859,1195,3625,79165,11,389,26514,2182,3930,8811,383,324,8065,38900,13,1708,1105,4864,841,550,10515,1438,6502,1469,90332,5636,409,7970,383,324,9952,20662,270,4558,325,11,503,6,25632,12339,653,28800,5636,409,77463,13,19421,409,45602,11,4864,1446,2192,14707,77818,2249,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,8586,374,264,14807,315,279,1495,512,198,49873,25823,284,510,38136,1907,11,7295,323,12366,13,14853,9919,11,2380,10507,315,9919,35906,11754,555,20320,8951,9057,555,779,19434,18336,2065,13,2100,11,304,279,3663,315,420,6023,11,586,11527,304,9822,617,743,709,6787,311,4465,2403,18336,2065,719,902,31550,6996,15293,13,8595,30,3011,596,832,13189,358,2846,14892,449,304,856,17850,323,430,584,2351,2133,311,1518,3871,13,578,16945,315,420,17850,374,311,387,3025,311,3041,15293,323,27375,1203,311,1521,6787,13,2100,1148,596,5076,449,279,23035,315,18336,2065,2533,433,596,1148,596,14718,279,3575,30,5629,11,433,706,912,6070,11,14188,5897,6463,12624,13,1789,3187,11,304,856,17850,11,358,7111,520,279,5426,3197,369,27252,18336,2065,4756,555,279,3109,304,220,679,23,13,1628,499,649,1518,430,3492,330,13584,950,2065,1,1511,220,7261,3115,2085,3596,27409,1148,433,3445,13,1666,264,1121,11,499,2351,1949,311,14532,420,23035,4869,499,1093,13,3011,596,433,13,3011,596,279,1176,1486
