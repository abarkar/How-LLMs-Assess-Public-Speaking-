It appears to be a transcript of a speech or presentation about sustainable development and the importance of using renewable resources. Here's a breakdown of the main points:\n\n1. The speaker draws an analogy between Matt Damon's character in \"Survivre sur Mars\" (Mars Survival) and our situation on Earth. Just as the astronaut must use his scientific knowledge to survive on a hostile planet, we need to work together to preserve our only home.\n2. The speaker highlights the urgency of addressing climate change, which is primarily caused by human activities, particularly the reliance on fossil fuels. To combat this issue, we must transition to renewable energy sources and reduce our carbon footprint.\n3. The speaker emphasizes the importance of considering oxygen in addition to hydrogen and carbon when choosing sustainable resources. This suggests that plant-based materials could be a viable alternative to fossil fuels.\n4. As a chemist, the speaker explains their approach to developing biodegradable materials from renewable sources. They aim to extract molecules of interest from plant-based materials, modify them chemically, and assemble them into a 100% biosourced material.\n5. The speaker highlights the importance of recycling fibers to strengthen the final product's mechanical properties. This approach enables the creation of durable structures using biodegradable materials.\n6. The speaker mentions two initiatives: using potato starch as an alternative to petrochemicals, and valorizing industrial food waste (e.g., orange peels) for its molecular components. They suggest that these approaches can be combined to build a sustainable future.\n\nThroughout the text, the speaker emphasizes the need for a paradigm shift in our approach to development. Instead of focusing on quick fixes or repairs, we must adopt a more sustainable mindset and transition to renewable resources to ensure a livable planet for generations to come.\n\nPlease let me know if you'd like me to clarify any specific points or provide further analysis!","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,29878,84595,1765,21725,1826,3284,13,11876,91806,1439,409,13678,73349,514,20605,8135,14707,13,7695,2322,665,99225,61480,40744,15907,74282,1056,3095,7330,333,8467,5019,259,1992,409,23589,265,74206,1765,6316,3197,66522,33615,13,19421,4502,17317,2322,83,919,12155,9045,665,34561,5019,27389,4120,1208,86806,3197,66522,1765,1208,88265,17317,18434,2439,26725,949,65381,326,6,75876,1180,31037,11,17317,1207,285,38448,514,2609,1133,11323,266,2428,1880,513,2482,3625,4197,35933,2854,33903,15132,665,7643,66014,665,5353,11,81186,29449,82620,7930,513,19477,3159,4043,306,13327,1001,1765,326,100017,3930,281,10515,5898,11,7930,1826,294,6,52009,1759,6316,594,2484,4046,5701,82585,13,8242,1677,466,42067,665,3841,84,841,25692,23761,5636,4684,76366,1744,1208,63922,668,409,7550,648,409,42067,23112,6863,1088,13,12095,17317,348,11206,2439,326,6339,45973,514,9517,6583,1386,1133,11323,266,2428,11,3900,47090,513,3127,52424,409,3846,3941,409,82620,1880,6223,321,19395,1291,96308,326,100017,951,594,40751,5790,283,899,4893,19227,645,1744,3625,5634,59307,294,6,4775,483,348,19395,10515,1604,13,12095,17317,5363,2439,3625,22337,20243,2482,4819,3930,281,10515,5898,11,389,71451,934,6,37907,15132,18525,91640,31605,14014,294,6,266,20969,294,6,67229,70,48099,1880,409,1841,20337,13,4366,45973,11,3625,22337,20243,2482,4819,3930,38900,348,19395,10515,278,15132,31605,14014,294,6,266,20969,294,6,67229,70,48099,1880,409,1841,20337,44767,11,10071,1391,1466,77,306,665,5636,326,6,61263,70,48099,13,62408,44178,16271,1826,100243,13,7695,1826,4043,306,13327,409,59394,665,77554,53301,5019,7706,12329,1208,9320,13,2998,37622,1744,38094,17194,11,1647,1665,333,1826,294,6,370,541,409,90194,1208,594,2484,5790,283,899,481,11,294,6,15824,556,3625,22337,20243,2482,294,55624,14081,49530,11,409,3625,23575,38094,81235,11,54401,409,68226,3625,89624,1880,4846,653,5634,28154,2933,220,1041,4,49554,30463,1339,978,13,1611,20662,76407,11,4864,1323,2050,514,1841,20337,294,6,4775,483,26495,458,1370,3930,1841,20337,348,19395,10515,278,7930,1826,5790,283,899,481,13,445,6,300,28111,425,409,27750,22337,20243,2482,8065,53052,409,28130,1486,409,10607,757,29557,294,6,677,2002,404,6316,18112,22337,978,3395,12267,665,56321,15696,7930,33956,57609,514,54206,1620,13,34447,33670,1208,18488,409,3846,5634,28154,2933,11,951,16178,417,92465,14014,15132,92528,412,14014,54401,409,5790,83110,43153,21744,10515,5512,32118,4919,8467,1880,39587,409,98054,514,5634,28154,2933,5636,31807,11451,13,62463,86374,4298,2249,5019,9598,45575,23761,42587,5512,665,37622,1744,86374,4298,2249,6033,70477,1634,409,6070,5019,1208,8246,27220,13,13678,73349,264,2665,13532,3625,30584,9004,409,88026,11,294,6,52009,1759,3625,67965,2053,28463,44829,447,54386,3625,38831,83384,26725,7010,3625,2307,76,1132,5512,9952,3625,11347,82,665,23442,263,13,6178,72,11,503,34155,2665,13532,294,81979,348,19395,978,2629,2249,13,622,34155,2665,13532,409,14448,12329,3625,7591,331,1441,409,326,6,485,592,7379,38450,12267,22299,1208,1069,2933,294,6,35264,1370,51173,11,6033,35597,951,22337,20243,2482,7930,56311,23761,11741,1339,288,409,1208,259,7404,951,6136,288,22299,514,259,3514,288,337,7930,3869,3846,9880,308,17771,6502,14448,69068,13,362,32384,11,3869,31632,409,27750,26633,28271,11,3625,30584,9004,409,88026,15132,665,5542,409,513,9517,1338,12329,13,19421,665,34501,951,81336,15433,4167,11,3900,1826,3284,409,19477,52750,1208,39973,409,2486,467,13,2998,67781,11,3625,6954,59307,57705,978,6091,811,4571,8467,8065,9511,67763,14848,1647,376,978,1744,27750,86374,4298,2249,220,1041,4,49554,414,66,5512,15132,7809,4893,3869,43153,4046,447,4023,812,2425,355,409,1208,281,10515,299,331,318,648,13,7695,841,274,6,74972,6502,409,46524,951,10105,5019,9517,62219,3625,7591,70,9011,2641,1744,17317,57038,25540,5512,11,10071,96308,409,62439,29449,11376,409,20028,3625,79165,13,3341,20662,9320,1826,6316,63846,13109,13,25145,72,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,32,27387,1495,0,1102,8111,311,387,264,36815,315,264,8982,477,15864,922,22556,4500,323,279,12939,315,1701,33268,5070,13,5810,596,264,31085,315,279,1925,3585,512,198,16,13,578,19114,27741,459,56203,1990,13678,73349,596,3752,304,330,63443,84595,1765,21725,1,320,44,1590,54451,8,323,1057,6671,389,9420,13,4702,439,279,47733,2011,1005,813,12624,6677,311,18167,389,264,33615,11841,11,584,1205,311,990,3871,311,21813,1057,1193,2162,13,198,17,13,578,19114,22020,279,54917,315,28118,10182,2349,11,902,374,15871,9057,555,3823,7640,11,8104,279,54180,389,31376,40373,13,2057,12896,420,4360,11,584,2011,9320,311,33268,4907,8336,323,8108,1057,12782,43972,13,198,18,13,578,19114,66159,279,12939,315,13126,24463,304,5369,311,35784,323,12782,994,19301,22556,5070,13,1115,13533,430,6136,6108,7384,1436,387,264,31528,10778,311,31376,40373,13,198,19,13,1666,264,8590,380,11,279,19114,15100,872,5603,311,11469,6160,536,78130,7384,505,33268,8336,13,2435,9395,311,8819,35715,315,2802,505,6136,6108,7384,11,5719,1124,8590,2740,11,323,42840,1124
