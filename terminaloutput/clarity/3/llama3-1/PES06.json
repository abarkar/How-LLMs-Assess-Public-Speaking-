Preventing this phenomenon is particularly complex because this gas is invisible, odorless, and tasteless. To establish effective treatments, it's also important to understand exactly how this seemingly harmless gas affects our bodies. One key answer lies in our respiratory mechanism. The oxygen we breathe is transported through the blood to a protein called myoglobin, which stores and redistributes oxygen to muscle tissues. And that's where our culprit gas comes in. It takes the place of oxygen in this protein, disrupting oxygen delivery to muscles and rendering our bodies unable to sustain themselves.\n\nMore specifically, carbon monoxide binds to an atom at the center of this protein, as you can see on the visual accompanying me. To study this phenomenon more deeply, it's important to be able to simulate it, for example using a computer. We use mathematical models that describe the interaction between the carbon monoxide molecule and the protein.\n\nWe then realize that the structure of the protein and therefore the contours of this maze change over time. The carbon monoxide molecule once inside the maze moves towards its center, trying to bind to the atom there. When it reaches an impasse, it simply waits for a change in the maze configuration before finding a new path. Well, you might say, these openings can take a very long time to appear, typically after millions of iterations on our algorithm. Meanwhile, the molecule remains stuck in the maze, and researchers get impatient at their computers.\n\nMy thesis work consists of proving that there exists a much faster way to simulate these appearances of paths. I claim that if my molecule stays stuck in this maze for a long time, it forgets its past trajectory. I can then find a way to simulate its future trajectory on multiple processors in parallel, which will allow me to significantly reduce the simulation time.\n\nBeyond this public health issue, there are actually many other physical systems where these results could be used. For example, mathematics, no matter how abstract they may seem, can help us better understand the world we live in.
