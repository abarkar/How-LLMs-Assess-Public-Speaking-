The speaker discusses how societal expectations often portray parents as always happy and fulfilled, but this is not always the case. They highlight that being a parent can be exhausting, leading to burnout, which can have severe consequences for children, couples, and entire families.\n\nThe psychologist shares their expertise on predicting and preventing parental burnout, using techniques such as stress management, mindfulness, and emotional regulation. To evaluate the effectiveness of their intervention, they even collect hair samples from parents before and after the program to measure cortisol levels (a marker of chronic stress) and quantify improvements in overall health and well-being.\n\nThe transcript also touches on the idea that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for parenting, as each family's experience is unique. The speaker aims to find solutions through their research.\n\nWould you like me to summarize this text further or help with any specific tasks related to this topic?","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,38891,89,653,11159,1370,543,51453,7010,514,43014,9189,26725,28490,89,294,22827,74817,12844,6223,978,11,294,22827,22641,3675,3930,34922,11,294,22827,18078,65746,11,294,22827,31547,258,1291,7930,27389,3462,5019,9189,26725,26317,628,1900,27389,69,14081,5512,1880,294,22827,9120,33571,22176,64,7930,17452,26317,22040,1441,3625,5636,282,788,1880,7930,513,27389,14310,86577,1744,9189,779,9188,89,44093,77818,2249,13,356,295,11159,11,76190,2439,31307,326,41901,69,685,13,19421,40744,27750,48577,64555,17724,11,76190,2439,12,645,6699,13,4241,9425,951,35881,2734,552,11,3625,8841,1640,1157,14848,84788,72,3869,17780,8977,1208,4294,87782,409,16968,514,8811,383,324,3930,38900,10253,6699,13,356,13059,519,11,25945,28800,409,76305,75460,274,55624,978,676,306,3869,4068,3625,6699,11,84440,11,18434,306,28130,46679,13109,13,46706,29449,7829,11,3900,379,264,6316,1651,6960,5019,1744,1208,46679,13109,45441,44093,13,39783,88411,6928,13,11876,60120,6699,312,20822,81541,951,503,337,552,7558,288,11,951,58482,6154,811,1880,84871,409,86696,78418,12249,296,625,2439,13,11876,60404,15132,16265,8839,11,39587,3625,6699,3567,969,1188,23761,3625,5636,77818,2249,3930,38900,13,356,8458,1826,83195,11,10071,6502,16968,514,27138,13,2998,59157,13109,11,23761,2748,11,39043,36709,13,64105,64,36709,3869,19227,1486,1744,409,5636,665,5636,409,33820,598,1880,409,26365,300,308,6,1138,81541,5636,3869,513,75802,88778,5512,13,81245,274,31769,652,285,306,13,5034,38317,20605,265,27584,934,85217,274,31769,652,285,306,5636,1744,3625,53542,294,82405,17724,13,41621,62299,6350,285,949,9424,688,11,3625,6699,84440,1474,5615,9004,841,11427,306,6502,934,85217,5945,544,8135,409,8395,9994,46679,13,11876,1615,978,45045,409,8395,9994,46679,15132,25945,19266,85,31539,13,12623,409,83977,1220,11,5636,409,4738,2436,11,5636,409,38605,6200,343,2436,1880,409,8811,30532,3095,13,350,519,5019,326,41901,61827,11,3625,21961,11,3625,2138,31355,1218,59307,13,3206,436,57332,665,37622,1744,8841,77828,6824,68,3869,550,15433,556,13,19421,3869,27389,43406,326,53149,9425,1133,951,6699,13,62293,11083,4631,4558,70,1157,11,17317,57038,390,79884,653,18629,409,27389,7611,7930,348,1082,3869,2579,263,1215,10253,6699,409,1208,274,14081,10610,13109,11,3930,60020,11,409,1208,24617,13,33150,45369,294,6,84426,4918,11,503,6,57379,3625,6699,3869,917,9484,265,951,12823,409,59471,3930,8631,11,409,7245,483,42563,11,409,59471,951,4046,76,41356,61907,3742,13,34447,4068,47929,1744,1647,21623,1826,31914,580,949,61651,14707,11,4864,57625,4618,7010,1208,83067,951,6699,13,41621,5019,7379,89,9189,13510,11,12769,11876,8841,1640,1157,11,39587,11,272,17771,4725,13,8345,34447,4864,1239,42441,28463,43153,3091,588,2249,13,27058,4046,838,8977,326,6,6581,292,582,13109,409,20662,21623,11,4864,28130,550,19010,79351,951,98385,296,4558,8696,409,3091,588,2249,33670,1880,3869,1208,1913,3930,18629,5019,93455,514,9637,2249,409,89942,2107,6374,556,11,75467,324,3930,8631,27076,2428,11,1880,10484,3125,326,58591,73511,7769,409,28130,14240,266,409,77323,1880,409,14707,85815,13,1952,308,53149,9484,6502,3869,326,31769,56745,3869,23761,653,7970,2748,13,24703,87264,951,14707,21965,1317,1157,14240,29246,11,25692,85815,27584,4225,258,552,13,356,17771,87320,7010,11083,58673,2249,11,503,6,434,61055,409,46524,951,10105,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5992,1093,499,617,264,36815,315,264,8982,477,31678,555,264,54595,389,279,8712,315,46679,8395,412,323,279,12939,315,12899,6699,311,5471,26885,11,9349,11,39332,11,323,11737,304,8689,13,578,19114,35434,1268,59529,17078,3629,25920,6699,439,2744,6380,323,41834,11,719,420,374,539,2744,279,1162,13,2435,11415,430,1694,264,2748,649,387,79953,11,6522,311,8395,412,11,902,649,617,15748,16296,369,2911,11,21961,11,323,4553,8689,627,198,791,54595,13551,872,19248,389,52997,323,27252,46679,8395,412,11,1701,12823,1778,439,8631,6373,11,71705,11,323,14604,19812,13,2057,15806,279,27375,315,872,21623,11,814,1524,6667,7013,10688,505,6699,1603,323,1306,279,2068,311,6767,89942,5990,320,64,11381,315,21249,8631,8,323,76498,18637,304,8244,2890,323,1664,33851,627,198,791,36815,1101,29727,389,279,4623,430,1070,374,912,832,7321,2269,1220,23148,6425,369,49058,11,439,1855,3070,596,3217,374,5016,13,578,19114,22262,311,1505,10105,1555,872,3495,627,198,29089,499,1093,757,311,63179,420,1495,4726,477,1520,449,904,3230,9256,5552,311,420,8712,30,128009],"total_duration":7873278467,"load_duration":145733,"prompt_eval_count":672,"prompt_eval_duration":1312112000,"eval_count":219,"eval_duration":6560486000}
