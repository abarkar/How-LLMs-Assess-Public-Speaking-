{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-11-19T13:33:11.150175207Z","response":"This text appears to be a transcript of a speech or presentation given by someone who has written a thesis on the topic of gay men who were deported to concentration camps during World War II. The speaker quotes Virginia Woolf and reflects on how they have known many people in their life, but most are now deceased, while others have been lost due to lack of strength or courage.\n\nThe speaker is passionate about breaking the silence surrounding this topic and sharing the stories of these men who were deported to concentration camps. They describe reading hundreds of books on the subject and feeling a sense of nausea and disgust at the brutality and violence inflicted upon these men. However, they also found solace in literature and used it as a way to connect with the stories of these men.\n\nThe speaker emphasizes that these men are not just statistics or names in a history book, but rather real people who exist through their words, testimony, and texts. They urge vigilance and attention to ensure that such dark hours do not return without warning, likening it to a crushing weight that would extinguish the bright sunlight of summer.\n\nOverall, this text appears to be a call to action to break the silence surrounding LGBTQ+ history and to honor the stories of those who were lost during times of persecution.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,14465,757,5945,10176,729,294,31109,17571,409,13286,47400,69,13,622,34155,4635,84,48488,409,48577,7010,7643,17536,13,5034,628,455,472,294,6,40997,84568,15132,10237,288,13,11876,46106,11,4864,3625,16796,824,1072,288,66021,1744,4864,308,34155,6502,15925,1208,5457,409,30517,261,1208,56949,13,6178,72,11,503,34155,55162,10036,30517,261,20662,56949,13,622,34155,55162,10036,60946,265,87320,220,868,220,931,28408,61244,84764,1188,24560,7591,403,5512,7010,3625,29135,409,29449,20545,13,29124,66,2182,89,11,90053,409,17317,11,9189,326,6,306,73602,949,9648,414,409,17317,11,3900,379,264,514,21847,13,62463,53542,11,41518,355,7010,3625,32118,438,417,409,326,6,90446,11,46152,14848,24560,7591,403,5512,7010,951,29135,409,20545,13,445,6496,1481,300,11,514,42775,1826,19259,519,7010,3625,1841,462,31539,13,11876,4020,1725,409,5634,969,593,951,18679,7245,84,688,1765,3625,4046,331,1572,2126,65,14014,13,11876,2107,2469,71151,3625,16806,11,10071,46152,841,834,306,55455,13,27058,62998,949,4366,346,934,85217,5320,29580,71686,23589,265,3869,29449,9880,13,12623,4864,41380,2852,27750,46681,409,326,6,90446,11,1880,5636,503,49152,2852,1208,4415,355,8047,13,14465,308,6,1138,344,2852,6502,3869,69379,265,3625,60053,11,3625,82113,8467,409,27750,7591,403,5512,13,14465,308,6,306,408,2852,35597,1744,514,21847,13,1708,1105,11,4864,757,36731,259,3514,978,5553,1208,60642,14081,1598,13,19421,272,17771,28463,514,70927,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,622,34155,8666,978,951,2960,33903,1880,951,2960,33903,294,6,283,19456,1154,1765,1208,7591,403,367,28408,31037,13,81245,87651,5808,1188,3869,1647,16536,4618,27750,7591,403,5512,13,6178,72,11,4864,841,348,11206,2852,6502,1744,7643,60120,325,45441,17475,13215,8047,32592,326,49455,301,409,1208,305,8511,13,622,34155,93974,1880,503,34155,93974,27750,6959,13,622,34155,912,2496,72,13,100178,11,35597,294,81979,6959,13,19421,74699,11,46152,15132,39015,13,622,34155,2579,434,258,978,3625,326,4558,85,417,13,622,34155,2579,434,258,978,3625,20043,2249,409,27750,7591,403,5512,13,81245,15132,409,1055,355,11083,1448,31539,13,46706,653,4046,10946,409,11939,11,409,30481,1744,1208,60642,14081,1598,757,29557,83,1339,11,4864,3625,16796,63034,5512,7010,3625,46496,13,19421,46152,296,6,546,44314,978,13,19421,503,6,25632,12339,68226,9189,20028,97448,75804,88253,7643,11939,5019,3846,42775,13,356,17771,653,42775,11,4864,5534,2852,11,294,6,1132,978,38469,60642,76743,556,13,7695,6824,68,11,9189,514,23933,10333,3846,21847,11,41091,503,34155,6233,648,409,514,1437,12329,13,622,34155,6233,648,409,69241,9779,514,21847,1370,951,78199,13,19421,26725,3625,78199,7930,757,87651,77065,3869,326,6,461,4618,11,26725,3625,78199,1744,4864,41380,7010,27750,10083,598,11,503,34155,6233,648,409,3625,22641,261,294,6,370,541,665,41091,1880,76826,409,9189,3625,20028,97448,13,62463,53542,2922,6496,11,46152,841,15132,6502,60019,10237,82,13,81245,3073,306,13,81245,15132,7010,12155,1495,288,13,81245,15132,7010,3625,47289,6489,625,1154,13,81245,15132,7010,26725,3625,78199,934,85217,14848,1208,1056,5512,13,34447,6666,13,58201,321,685,13,62463,76145,1794,65,417,5019,969,1188,19443,404,15878,1744,54613,841,274,41901,264,716,20822,535,13,19421,45575,11,39043,87264,22299,6316,38883,523,2070,409,628,2925,1437,285,519,42067,4046,566,266,519,13612,321,294,6,39883,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2028,1495,8111,311,387,264,36815,315,264,8982,477,15864,2728,555,4423,889,706,5439,264,17850,389,279,8712,315,8485,3026,889,1051,68210,311,20545,29135,2391,4435,5111,8105,13,578,19114,17637,13286,47400,69,323,27053,389,1268,814,617,3967,1690,1274,304,872,2324,11,719,1455,527,1457,43720,11,1418,3885,617,1027,5675,4245,311,6996,315,8333,477,25775,627,198,791,19114,374,25429,922,15061,279,21847,14932,420,8712,323,11821,279,7493,315,1521,3026,889,1051,68210,311,20545,29135,13,2435,7664,5403,11758,315,6603,389,279,3917,323,8430,264,5647,315,61880,323,68162,520,279,63132,323,9349,69177,5304,1521,3026,13,4452,11,814,1101,1766,2092,580,304,17649,323,1511,433,439,264,1648,311,4667,449,279,7493,315,1521,3026,627,198,791,19114,66159,430,1521,3026,527,539,1120,13443,477,5144,304,264,3925,2363,11,719,4856,1972,1274,889,3073,1555,872,4339,11,24365,11,323,22755,13,2435,33147,38494,685,323,6666,311,6106,430,1778,6453,4207,656,539,471,2085,10163,11,55385,287,433,311,264,14770,4785,430,1053,56807,819,279,10107,40120,315,7474,627,198,28589,11,420,1495,8111,311,387,264,1650,311,1957,311,1464,279,21847,14932,51042,10,3925,323,311,16044,279,7493,315,1884,889,1051,5675,2391,3115,315,56529,13,128009],"total_duration":8919160328,"load_duration":242794,"prompt_eval_count":688,"prompt_eval_duration":1321150000,"eval_count":253,"eval_duration":7597132000}
