Beyond the vague answer parents give their children, we really wonder: from a fertilized egg cell to whole organisms like you and me. What I'm particularly interested in during embryonic development are neurons, cells that transmit information. How do they position themselves at the right place in the organism and connect correctly with each other to form functional circuits? These questions have already been well-studied from a chemical perspective, with the discovery of molecules that guide neurons. The novelty of my project is to look at the role of mechanical forces in setting up neural circuits.\n\nTo do this, I use the zebrafish model, as you can see here on the left, with images taken either face-on or sideways. These images were taken about a day after spawning and zooming in on the embryo's head with a microscope, like the image at center, we can see the brain developing, with eyes forming to the sides and future nostrils of the fish above. In the fish's nostril, neurons migrate away from the surface of the brain while extending behind them a long arm, the axon, which allows them to connect with brain cells. That's the image you can see on the right. Neurons, just like other cells, have intrinsic mechanisms that allow them to migrate and advance in their environment. In the case of nostril neurons, surprise: even when these intrinsic mechanisms don't work, neurons move forward and extend their axon to connect with the brain. It's a bit like watching a car on a flat terrain whose engine is broken but still moving forward. We can then think of two hypotheses: either there are people with brain problems or there are people pushing the car or pulling it. It's the same thing for nostril neurons. We think that it's cells from the eye, located below, that pull the nostril neurons to the side, leading to the extension of their axon and connection with the brain.\n\nTo verify this idea, I looked at embryos with a genetic mutation that don't form eyes. I saw that on these embryos, the nostril neurons didn't move forward. These results come to confirm our hypothesis, according to which nostril neurons are more or less identical and therefore don't function correctly. This method shows that cells from the eye pull nostril neurons and demonstrates that it's not just chemical molecules that are important during development but also mechanical forces.\n\nBeyond the fish's nostril, better understanding the role of mechanical forces in development will shed new light on neurological disorders. So, may the force be with your neurons!","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,46706,1647,9511,67763,11,389,513,17477,6316,3488,79380,4382,11,1880,1744,9189,47592,78705,55755,46939,1153,8047,11,7930,1826,11,4068,389,20272,3625,90551,65,5512,949,33150,48226,6496,409,1208,90509,653,28800,4046,78134,1744,3625,6699,3381,3869,43153,60404,11,17317,389,513,62163,60019,11,4068,11,3869,31632,294,31109,2849,1130,69483,1739,58482,1321,8047,11,389,17782,3869,20028,951,47120,288,1218,4918,11,259,2053,1744,9189,1880,41091,13,24703,7930,296,55624,978,22550,5636,54008,67882,8065,45369,3930,82620,44481,13767,556,11,3846,15132,3625,21850,3233,11,3625,2849,2482,7930,1380,4150,73468,326,6,26125,13,12535,513,2361,77,306,12,8839,8065,7970,842,69596,7010,326,6,8629,44618,11,1880,513,4667,306,12,8839,4495,1133,3625,7120,9952,3625,46106,11,5019,4846,951,46121,34501,36527,949,62463,4860,14848,46939,24560,14707,14240,21178,14014,294,22827,1486,409,48234,38094,2428,11,9952,1208,35881,15170,668,409,22337,20243,2482,7930,1709,1748,3625,21850,3233,11,10071,1208,77701,94943,409,1647,46494,1826,409,5363,261,514,436,57332,951,8603,32118,4919,8467,7010,1208,57459,665,2035,951,46121,21850,6863,2249,13,27058,45602,11,503,49963,1082,514,83597,3930,3273,49363,1167,4558,21152,11,22299,9189,45366,514,46131,49733,3869,96721,11,9952,951,5448,550,5014,11,45441,409,3663,11,45441,1765,514,81337,13,62463,5448,14848,24560,550,5014,3869,50026,653,9880,42138,1208,37194,68,11,1880,665,15932,519,1765,1208,83067,409,326,6,9034,894,263,11,9952,514,73757,11,22299,1765,326,78337,8065,12541,11,389,25692,46131,514,272,5976,2933,7930,513,52895,375,11,9952,409,46777,81337,3625,20043,2249,7930,513,369,479,11,1880,8065,89429,355,11,3625,37923,44669,1572,3930,3273,49363,13,46706,1208,44669,483,3930,3273,49363,1167,4558,21152,11,3625,21850,3233,29444,8135,665,274,31769,385,59110,409,1208,7479,3930,272,5976,2933,11,16968,665,682,647,68,519,2761,65220,84440,653,1317,46496,11,326,6,710,606,11,77433,8065,43014,46152,513,4667,306,9952,3625,2849,2482,3930,272,5976,2933,13,356,17771,326,78337,934,54386,25692,46131,3869,7118,635,13,11876,21850,3233,11,16968,22299,3625,46106,2849,2482,11,14848,951,32118,4919,2191,288,10805,1354,4558,14295,7930,28130,29557,73468,409,9971,261,1880,294,49152,11967,7010,28130,50026,40280,13,46706,514,4865,951,21850,3233,409,1208,44669,483,11,13051,11,27584,87158,27750,32118,4919,2191,288,10805,1354,4558,14295,841,34501,77,306,6502,11,3625,21850,3233,1860,1149,306,1880,14240,29293,28130,3944,606,5019,513,4667,261,9952,514,272,5976,2933,13,356,17771,653,28800,22299,4502,389,5363,1339,6316,81645,1765,653,25911,46089,11,15890,514,88486,324,1826,45324,978,1880,934,54386,1208,23933,1339,42676,27584,1860,11967,13,1952,25692,45575,23423,261,3869,26633,45455,4558,9459,11,45441,3900,379,264,951,47104,7930,14848,951,52088,66474,409,272,5976,2933,11,45441,3900,379,264,951,47104,7930,17258,784,306,1208,81645,11,45441,3900,379,264,951,47104,7930,1208,28387,406,13,356,17771,1208,27584,14896,5019,3625,21850,3233,409,1208,44669,483,13,1952,73953,1744,3846,15132,3625,2849,2482,409,326,6,52822,321,11,7930,513,10109,306,665,21273,788,11,7930,28387,406,3625,21850,3233,409,1208,44669,483,1765,514,81337,11,83786,25108,52985,326,65948,647,1133,409,28130,3944,606,11,77433,8065,43014,46152,513,4667,306,9952,514,272,5976,2933,13,27058,77680,3125,20662,887,8047,11,503,34155,5363,978,951,44481,2439,7930,14848,6316,27472,78422,99188,1880,7930,841,369,479,6502,294,6,52822,321,13,622,34155,33614,1744,1765,27750,44481,2439,11,3625,21850,3233,409,1208,44669,483,308,49152,1149,306,6502,13,62463,100246,3355,89810,2389,404,1195,29449,45455,4558,325,11,65735,1208,88265,3625,21850,3233,409,1208,44669,483,11,15132,5636,6033,40970,3608,8467,11,1880,39587,11,46152,841,34501,77,306,6502,13,356,17771,6316,98652,65735,1208,88265,3625,2849,2482,409,326,6,52822,321,28387,406,3625,21850,3233,409,1208,44669,483,11,1880,20605,265,934,35329,308,59858,264,6502,1744,3625,22337,20243,2482,38094,8467,7930,15132,75419,8065,45369,3930,82620,11,10071,28463,3625,8603,32118,4919,8467,13,33150,48226,6496,409,1208,44669,483,3930,3273,49363,1167,4558,21152,11,64972,60946,265,514,436,57332,951,8603,32118,4919,8467,8065,45369,3930,82620,1469,403,2473,653,35462,4046,49272,425,1765,3625,8811,17491,3930,72601,32015,2249,13,1708,1105,11,1744,1208,5457,45441,9952,26317,21850,3233,758,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,8586,374,279,11093,1495,512,198,644,856,27692,11,584,2610,264,4856,4382,3488,430,499,617,4762,2736,4691,6261,25,1268,656,24869,1376,30,31886,279,40146,4320,6699,3041,872,2911,11,584,2216,5895,25,505,264,36214,1534,19151,2849,311,4459,44304,1093,499,323,757,13,3639,358,2846,8104,8173,304,2391,44481,14338,4500,527,34313,11,7917,430,30382,2038,13,2650,656,814,2361,5694,520,279,1314,2035,304,279,47120,323,4667,12722,449,1855,1023,311,1376,16003,46121,30,4314,4860,617,2736,1027,1664,5594,664,1142,505,264,11742,13356,11,449,279,18841,315,35715,430,8641,34313,13,578,67409,315,85
