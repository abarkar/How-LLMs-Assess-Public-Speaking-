I'll do my best to provide an accurate translation.\n\nHere's the combined text:\n\n\"It's the Odyssey of Ulysses, a state route that his name signified man of pain, the obstacles that face him and which he overcomes one after another. And now social economy, evolution of social economy, it's very important. The dynamics of social economy evolve very quickly and Maresex will carry the contribution on social economy in Europe. This means that today's environment is not good for social prices and social prices do not have much data to create a favorable commercial environment. This means that it's impossible to find the contribution. Maresex will carry the contribution of social economy by studying balance sheets and finding indicators. Once these indicators exist, I will find the contribution between social economies and prices.\n\nAnd now, why social economy? A month ago, an agreement was signed between Australia and France. This means the manufacture of all submarines that offer 100 jobs over 10 years. This is horrible. What's going on? Imagine an economy that makes up 20% of social enterprises and this would translate to a 40% reduction in taste for the final product. This means a very important and competitive economy.\n\nSo, we think that if there is a very important social economy, using these indicators, it will cost us in the future and give a reconciled vision of economic drifts... and that's it.\"\n\nPlease note that I've tried my best to provide an accurate translation, but some nuances may be lost in translation.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,356,17771,514,45640,294,6,52,61492,325,11,4160,648,294,6,27887,68238,1744,4538,9859,1879,333,689,275,40351,409,25595,36077,11,3625,32116,7930,274,6,83336,306,77558,25400,1880,934,35329,8508,275,3625,7120,42138,3625,46106,13,19421,74699,326,31769,45317,648,75107,11,326,31769,65272,409,326,31769,45317,648,75107,11,272,17771,25945,3062,13,11876,18003,2191,288,409,326,31769,45317,648,75107,4046,12821,11942,25945,100198,1880,64898,11814,2700,2473,1208,19035,1765,326,31769,45317,648,75107,7010,326,6,31880,732,8458,76605,13510,1744,326,41901,2842,40280,294,6,2933,69572,88253,11,3900,308,17771,6502,7970,5019,3625,38847,12288,83391,1880,3625,38847,12288,83391,308,6,546,6502,48488,409,46681,5019,75831,653,50026,40280,8518,37849,13,356,8458,76605,13510,934,35329,308,17771,6502,3284,409,46524,1208,19035,13,64898,11814,2700,2473,1208,19035,409,326,31769,45317,648,75107,665,14240,41939,3625,20934,598,951,38847,1880,665,26483,77282,3625,13519,1759,5368,818,37291,27750,13519,1759,3073,306,11,4864,46524,2192,1208,19035,9465,3625,82653,552,65207,1880,3625,38847,13,19421,74699,11,87320,326,31769,45317,648,75107,30,7695,379,264,653,46415,11,3900,264,24560,1879,978,653,14902,9465,326,52374,5523,648,1880,1208,9822,13,356,8458,76605,13510,1208,59251,409,26725,3625,32592,71098,1354,7930,1022,8135,220,1041,8654,385,285,1765,220,605,65838,732,8458,76605,13510,28201,13,3489,17771,54312,7930,513,39904,30,38891,89,6316,82653,648,7930,31435,220,508,4,951,97263,65207,1880,45602,4790,21581,1339,7010,220,1272,4,6316,9517,23985,409,733,60768,7010,514,54206,1620,13,356,8458,76605,13510,6316,82653,648,25945,36897,1880,75332,3486,9833,1105,11,17317,23423,2439,1744,274,35329,379,264,6316,82653,648,75107,25945,36897,11,665,42587,519,27750,13519,1759,11,45602,17317,87885,1137,3869,326,6,5389,404,1880,3869,71751,6316,11376,9517,41546,4008,8047,951,7591,81,1924,82653,8467,1880,1131,272,17771,6502,1131,272,17771,10415,978,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5084,1093,499,617,264,36815,315,264,8982,477,15864,304,8753,11,323,499,4265,1093,757,311,1520,499,16343,279,22755,1139,264,56887,6498,14807,13,358,3358,656,856,1888,311,3493,459,13687,14807,627,198,8586,596,279,11093,1495,1473,12348,596,279,66881,315,549,398,784,288,11,264,1614,6149,430,813,836,1879,1908,893,315,6784,11,279,32116,430,3663,1461,323,902,568,927,6716,832,1306,2500,13,1628,1457,3674,8752,11,15740,315,3674,8752,11,433,596,1633,3062,13,578,30295,315,3674,8752,38680,1633,6288,323,64898,11814,690,6920,279,19035,389,3674,8752,304,4606,13,1115,3445,430,3432,596,4676,374,539,1695,369,3674,7729,323,3674,7729,656,539,617,1790,828,311,1893,264,37849,8518,4676,13,1115,3445,430,433,596,12266,311,1505,279,19035,13,64898,11814,690,6920,279,19035,315,3674,8752,555,21630,8335,25112,323,9455,34824,13,9843,1521,34824,3073,11,358,690,1505,279,19035,1990,3674,37671,323,7729,627,198,3112,1457,11,3249,3674,8752,30,362,2305,4227,11,459,9306,574,8667,1990,8494,323,9822,13,1115,3445,279,30847,315,682,86642,430,3085,220,1041,7032,927,220,605,1667,13,1115,374,28201,13,3639,596,2133,389,30,38891,459,8752,430,3727,709,220,508,4,315,3674,40919,323,420,1053,15025,311,264,220,1272,4,14278,304,12945,369,279,1620,2027,13,1115,3445,264,1633,3062,323,15022,8752,627,198,4516,11,584,1781,430,422,1070,374,264,1633,3062,3674,8752,11,1701,1521,34824,11,433,690,2853,603,304,279,3938,323,3041,264,32545,2230,11376,315,7100,34738,82,1131,323,430,596,433,1210,198,198,5618,5296,430,358,3077,6818,856,1888,311,3493,459,13687,14807,11,719,1063,84889,1253,387,5675,304,14807,13,128009],"total_duration":10942038031,"load_duration":140093,"prompt_eval_count":394,"prompt_eval_duration":786576000,"eval_count":341,"eval_duration":10154786000}
