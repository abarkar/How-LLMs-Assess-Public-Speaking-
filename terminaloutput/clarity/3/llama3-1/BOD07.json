It's a transcript of a lecture by a linguist, and it's about the sounds of languages, specifically the rare consonants found in certain languages. The speaker starts by saying that she's not a typical linguist who studies word meanings, but rather one who loves languages so much that she wants to take them apart and see how they work.\n\nShe compares languages to cars, with each language being like a different vehicle with its own unique engine sounds (phonemes). She explains that her area of study is phonology, which involves looking at the sound inventories of languages - essentially, the storage of important sounds in our brains for each language we learn. She notes that these sound inventories can change significantly between languages, and gives an example from her native English to illustrate this.\n\nThe speaker then discusses how some consonants are rarer than others across languages, and she's trying to figure out why certain languages have them and others don't. She believes there's a link between the sounds of our languages and what happens in our brains, and that phonology allows us to look under the hood of our own language and ourselves.\n\nFinally, she mentions the four words from different languages that she started with - \"Yalam\", \"Gbg\", \"Khung\", and \"Twelfth\" (Non) - which all contain rare consonants. She says she's not sure what these words mean, but they're interesting to her because of their unique sounds.\n\nOverall, this text is a fascinating exploration of the sounds of languages and how our brains process them.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,816,17243,11,480,12498,11,20774,2234,11,12015,88798,13,11842,11,4864,841,36731,6502,6316,10896,5048,665,5542,409,20028,6316,1589,1082,11,4864,9189,36015,13,14465,3355,729,409,19126,263,3913,99309,78199,7010,99309,8859,1157,25945,96642,13,34447,27750,99309,78199,14848,79071,14896,409,25945,3062,665,34561,13,19421,41091,11,665,37622,1744,39603,17194,11,4864,52571,3869,60946,265,13,34447,9189,12584,89,757,7631,261,11,12769,61651,11,1208,39603,17194,11,294,3695,5392,788,11,1744,76605,13510,27750,99309,78199,45575,949,8345,19421,4864,91507,9189,13510,11,4864,841,63762,6502,13,4366,346,1744,41091,11,4864,841,36731,6502,6316,39603,17194,7617,1604,13,2998,5589,11,4864,841,36731,6502,71269,689,1001,33288,2536,5636,13,34447,41091,11,4864,308,57286,664,648,6502,3625,6225,951,78199,11,503,57286,664,648,3625,26419,951,8859,1157,13,34447,272,17771,75249,653,39603,17194,949,80905,294,6,370,541,11,653,39603,17194,841,1370,273,6502,52842,42625,51854,8859,1157,13,1952,308,17771,6502,78422,648,665,1099,13400,556,11,13080,665,30299,540,4714,383,13,1252,39603,17194,1826,26077,447,22827,7930,61735,19227,1001,3625,8859,1157,11,934,35329,76605,3625,59148,716,665,11990,409,4411,346,12249,1880,4043,1155,409,3625,51010,36501,5019,46131,4068,84568,34501,77,306,13,1952,1826,653,28800,22299,3625,32118,4919,3457,729,13,1952,61735,5945,72905,514,2107,354,5019,20028,57625,15610,7010,3625,88486,1759,951,8859,1157,13,19421,3846,7930,1826,27584,5636,78422,532,11,272,17771,1744,46777,96282,1826,22299,6316,81645,51199,68,13,2009,55467,11,22299,74637,9952,4538,88486,324,7930,436,263,2298,818,13,19421,326,6,124524,2852,11,7930,1826,653,28800,22299,514,12015,29008,934,54386,4160,275,961,412,1880,7930,20272,71151,951,1437,12059,293,11403,417,13,426,1116,11,3846,7930,296,55624,978,22550,11,272,17771,1120,1133,514,1437,3159,409,88486,324,13,4366,346,1744,39043,17317,665,22011,48488,1765,4068,34501,77,306,3625,88486,1759,84440,1474,5615,9004,13,19421,7010,1647,96839,11,1208,51923,38469,11,389,1239,42441,32592,12155,2047,417,2107,2469,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,514,272,5976,2933,13,1952,42775,273,9952,3846,934,54386,917,6853,951,17459,17724,13,356,17771,22299,951,5708,1154,409,26419,1179,1821,7010,46777,96282,1744,9189,47592,4685,8047,7010,514,272,5976,2933,13,34447,27750,5708,1154,2609,306,9952,46777,96282,1744,9189,1370,41881,13,4366,51173,11,7010,7643,96282,308,460,273,11,3846,7930,1826,326,6,124524,2852,11,389,308,26248,6502,514,4538,549,22299,56949,13,1952,308,26248,1744,514,4538,63935,22299,29465,68,13,19421,3930,16081,11,3625,6590,385,17144,14848,3930,8811,9465,27750,26633,26419,549,1880,549,13,34447,46152,834,306,1744,3846,308,17771,6502,25945,3062,1208,44178,16271,9465,549,1880,549,13,62463,26419,513,594,28111,306,19227,1001,13,1952,17317,60946,42676,389,1370,273,55467,11,259,52152,47391,66522,13,34447,272,17771,42676,27584,1208,44178,16271,9465,72006,16081,1880,72006,11957,13,1708,1105,11,14707,89504,6316,96282,308,26248,55455,3869,46131,9952,653,7970,30200,22299,389,9189,917,9484,3869,326,31769,56745,13,356,17771,76776,74282,66014,1880,44178,63934,1291,9465,3625,26419,1179,1821,7010,3625,5708,1154,294,31109,96282,11,3869,326,49455,265,13,1708,1105,11,19443,2439,3869,27750,99309,78199,3930,65385,13,3489,17771,54312,934,85217,14848,665,34561,949,2998,20272,11,46152,687,72,89810,45889,12,8699,951,78605,4978,3625,5636,436,5518,3930,38900,11,22299,426,11,356,6033,426,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,11,389,38831,83384,25945,28800,409,4160,42204,39723,514,88486,324,20272,653,409,27750,99309,1437,12059,2922,6496,13,19421,41091,11,7010,7643,270,4558,325,11,503,6,26577,648,294,6,30992,72684,87320,3738,288,8859,1157,687,72,89810,27750,78605,4978,436,5518,11,10071,6502,294,81979,13,4366,346,934,35329,379,264,653,55520,3062,9465,3625,26419,409,12155,8859,1157,1880,3846,7930,513,39904,7010,12155,272,5976,12249,13,19421,1208,51923,38469,17317,29557,409,5363,261,32592,514,2107,354,409,12155,8859,1157,1880,409,17317,1474,5615,9004,13,14465,9189,312,1195,25134,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,27387,1495,0,1102,596,264,36815,315,264,31678,555,264,39603,380,11,323,433,596,922,279,10578,315,15823,11,11951,279,9024,78605,1821,1766,304,3738,15823,13,578,19114,8638,555,5605,430,1364,596,539,264,14595,39603,380,889,7978,3492,50800,11,719,4856,832,889,16180,15823,779,1790,430,1364,6944,311,1935,1124,10980,323,1518,1268,814,990,627,198,8100,43565,15823,311,9515,11,449,1855,4221,1694,1093,264,2204,7458,449,1202,1866,5016,4817,10578,320,52801,16034,570,3005,15100,430,1077,3158,315,4007,374,51923,2508,11,902,18065,3411,520,279,5222,17459,2490,315,15823,482,16168,11,279,5942,315,3062,10578,304,1057,35202,369,1855,4221,584,4048,13,3005,8554,430,1521,5222,17459,2490,649,2349,12207,1990,15823,11,323,6835,459,3187,505,1077,10068,6498,311,41468,420,627,198,791,19114,1243,35434,1268,1063,78605,1821,527,436,61570,1109,3885,4028,15823,11,323,1364,596,4560,31
