These small applications are playful, easy to use, but do you realize that behind them are workers? These workers are presented by the platform as independent contractors. They are also referred to as freelancers with expenses. Being an independent contractor means what? It means escaping the fundamental criteria of employment contracts, which is legal subordination. This legal subordination is a game of cat and mouse. It dates back to the end of the 19th century and was originally designed to discipline factory workers. Today, legal subordination has changed significantly since it now compensates for the submission of employees by opening up new possibilities. In other words, legal subordination is defined as grouping powers of control, sanctions, and direction that an employer exercises over their employee.\n\nSo if I tell you that freelancers with expenses are independent, it means they do not see any imposition of these powers of control, sanctions, and direction. But is this really the case? Are there no indicators of legal subordination in the relationships between freelancers and platforms?\n\nAnd I come back to the question of legal subordination. That's where my thesis aims to analyze these working relationships and when these freelancers are not as independent as they seem, to take them back to the origin of salaried work.\n\nThe problem is that the platform model has already been fought over. Now this model is in a pyramid shape. At the top, there is a platform with authority. Below, you have freelancers, for example, delivery workers who have obtained some sort of promotion and have obtained some sort of power. And they too are holders of authority. At the third level of this pyramid, you find equipment rental companies that also hold authority. And at the bottom, there is a final freelancer who sees the authority of the three upper levels of the pyramid. So is this final freelancer subordinate? Well no, because the diffusion of powers among the hands of the first three levels of the pyramid prevents the platform from being taken over. And it also has formal recognition of legal subordination.\n\nSo what do we do? We go to our corpus of law and find a right that could account for these relationships of control, domination, and power. And there is only one, which is competition law. My idea is to take competition law and insert a part into labor law. The final objective is... it's to offer protection to this worker who is not really independent. And open up the right to labor protection for them.\n\nThank you.\"","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,48109,57038,26725,7010,12155,36122,6316,3851,409,955,28712,11,28712,469,1900,11,65752,2689,6033,80606,13,62463,98385,8522,11,84568,15132,45064,8467,11,84568,15132,3547,3742,294,6,97675,11,10071,47592,45325,42563,1744,2761,65220,513,61387,306,951,42775,77660,949,62463,42775,77660,11,46152,15132,57485,5512,1370,1208,12235,76701,22299,14240,519,951,1280,978,3825,1821,13,1952,3625,917,6853,44767,951,23095,93551,10253,91653,13,1717,232,10367,1280,978,3825,519,11,39043,76605,13510,75249,949,64105,64,76605,13510,934,54386,4046,331,34531,10253,4742,31539,21901,2908,12249,3930,88103,409,42775,11,7930,1826,1208,1207,99344,16422,307,2428,13,62408,1207,99344,16422,307,2428,11,272,17771,653,51655,1448,292,467,13,46408,2457,409,1208,1913,3930,1630,5511,68,1880,27549,50590,24560,23423,8047,3869,326,6,4775,483,5019,15869,10670,3625,6033,85,17740,409,1208,25626,9047,7379,13,362,9832,77492,88253,11,1208,1207,99344,16422,307,2428,264,14707,2609,978,44829,447,80720,86100,14573,261,1208,5945,2796,3930,4371,2850,978,665,25400,6033,19456,519,514,29340,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1744,1208,1207,99344,16422,307,2428,11,27549,513,47371,2381,22299,1239,896,519,3625,17258,3415,17260,409,6155,57332,409,24679,1880,409,5216,934,22827,3539,12844,7591,668,396,1765,4538,4371,2850,978,13,1708,1105,76826,11,4502,4864,9189,834,1744,3625,23095,93551,10253,91653,15132,1280,978,3825,1821,11,39043,76605,13510,934,85217,841,4160,1188,6502,274,98279,20672,1765,84440,27750,17258,3415,17260,409,6155,57332,409,24679,1880,409,5216,13,34447,1826,54312,60019,514,4865,949,452,59858,264,2442,57375,85624,57182,409,1207,99344,16422,307,2428,7010,3625,4398,9465,23095,93551,10253,91653,1880,12235,76701,949,19421,503,41901,5891,80463,3869,1208,3488,409,1208,1207,99344,16422,307,2428,13,356,17771,39015,1744,326,6,1735,333,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,7930,348,1082,3869,8678,805,27750,4398,409,42775,1880,11,87158,27750,23095,93551,10253,91653,841,15132,6502,19227,1001,1280,978,3825,1821,1744,39043,11,3869,3625,45712,261,5553,326,6,4775,483,3930,4371,41979,13,2009,80259,11,272,17771,1744,514,83597,12235,76701,264,46939,326,21493,978,13,423,5512,494,2852,11,3846,83597,1826,32592,57128,47897,1604,13,33150,1794,4150,11,389,264,6316,12235,76701,7591,73468,23994,409,326,49455,269,13109,13,2998,21273,788,11,389,264,951,23095,93551,10253,91653,11,1370,51173,951,56984,1759,11,7930,40142,1188,4615,1509,6316,80444,409,20862,1880,7930,40142,1188,4615,1509,6316,80444,409,20862,13,19421,84440,28463,15132,85877,6960,1759,294,49455,269,13109,13,33150,8348,13532,25253,14240,425,409,20662,4611,2453,579,11,389,38831,83384,951,15983,10515,5512,409,3813,409,86374,22811,7930,44767,15132,85877,24677,1238,294,49455,269,13109,13,19421,16968,665,3122,11,389,264,653,23095,66749,10253,91653,1620,7930,513,4160,275,917,24332,326,49455,269,13109,951,56321,6954,4918,14240,1154,409,1208,4611,2453,579,13,1708,1105,11,3846,23095,66749,10253,91653,1620,1826,54312,934,35329,1826,1207,22231,52235,949,61651,14707,2536,11,66021,1744,326,31769,1768,79,321,1001,951,17258,3415,17260,9465,3625,69236,951,56321,6954,4918,14240,1154,409,1208,4611,2453,579,8654,5615,1557,1208,312,9868,409,1208,12235,76701,13,19421,3900,264,28463,1208,88605,294,31109,1207,99344,16422,307,2428,1376,6853,13,1708,1105,11,934,17771,54312,934,54386,20272,949,61651,14707,11,389,11412,48908,23008,9211,7010,29449,43194,16422,307,2428,653,64079,7930,44521,1339,18757,1645,444,3458,66014,409,15907,4398,409,6155,57332,11,409,55949,1880,409,68226,13,19421,3900,308,41901,1826,934,22827,11,272,17771,514,64079,409,1208,3613,21201,13,19421,1647,887,8047,11,272,17771,409,59394,514,64079,409,1208,3613,21201,1880,294,6,1354,52424,6316,48901,5553,514,64079,3930,42775,13,445,6,1735,333,1620,11,272,17771,75249,949,356,17771,294,6,1885,38315,6316,9313,3869,3846,42775,36077,6502,60019,1280,978,3825,519,13,19421,28130,6033,63346,64079,3869,1208,9313,3930,64079,3930,42775,13,14465,9189,312,1195,25134,13,25145,72,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,8586,374,279,6498,14807,315,279,1495,1473,10944,682,617,459,28712,11,28712,469,1900,11,65752,2689,477,24526,269,3851,389,1057,36122,13,4314,2678,8522,527,57169,11,4228,311,1005,11,719,656,499,13383,430,4920,1124,527,7487,30,4314,7487,527,10666,555,279,5452,439,9678,33840,13,2435,527,1101,14183,311,439,32231,32842,449,18512,13,21347,459,9678,31072,3445,1148,30,1102,3445,53754,279,16188,13186,315,14740,17517,11,902,374,5897,1207,99344,13,1115,5897,1207,99344,374,264,1847,315,8415,323,8814,13,1102,13003,1203,311,279,842,315,279,220,777,339,9478,323,574,13517,6319,311,26434,8803,7487,13,11450,11,5897,1207,99344,706,5614,12207,2533,433,1457,14573,988,369,279,21142,315,8420,555,8736,709,502,24525,13,763,1023,4339,11,5897,1207,99344,374,4613,439,50284,13736,315,2585,11,24679,11,323,5216,430,459,19683,23783,927,872,9548,627,198,4516,422,358,3371,499,430,32231,32842,449,18512,527,9678,11,433,3445,814,656,539,1518
