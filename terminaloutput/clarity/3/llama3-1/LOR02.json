The speaker describes their work at a laboratory where they analyze rocks from other planets and moons, including meteorites, lunar samples, and Martian rocks.\n\nThey discuss the importance of xenon, a rare gas that serves as a tracer for understanding the origin of the atmosphere. They have analyzed the xenon content in rocks from Earth's depths and compared it to the xenon found in meteorites, which has an identical composition. However, they note that the xenon in the atmosphere is different, with a greenish tint instead of the yellow or red colors associated with the meteorite and solar emissions.\n\nThe speaker suggests that the missing blue component needed to explain the greenish color of atmospheric xenon may be found in comets, which were visited by the European Space Agency's Rosetta spacecraft. They report that the instrument on board the spacecraft detected a blue-colored xenon signature in comet samples.\n\nBased on this finding, they propose that Earth's atmosphere had an initial yellow or reddish hue due to the influence of meteorites and solar emissions, but later acquired its current greenish tint due to the addition of cometary material. The speaker concludes by emphasizing the uniqueness of Earth's atmosphere and how it has evolved over time.\n\nSome key points from the text include:\n\n* The origin of Earth's atmosphere is still a topic of debate.\n* Xenon is a rare gas that can serve as a tracer for understanding the evolution of the atmosphere.\n* Meteorites and comets may have played a role in shaping the composition of Earth's atmosphere over time.\n* The current greenish tint of atmospheric xenon may be due to the addition of cometary material.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,5034,10335,265,1826,5016,8065,19910,3930,72601,2092,12267,13,12103,14036,764,12339,11,1208,30179,768,294,6,511,978,598,1880,409,17536,3869,829,7479,3381,294,80720,6316,824,273,9024,13,34447,294,94572,15273,3355,89810,27750,56086,1744,17317,33515,2439,1880,7930,14848,17634,84,29449,3197,66522,14464,481,949,33150,9511,67763,11,503,34155,3869,7643,46096,6316,4526,409,938,8696,11741,977,4014,417,11,18916,28674,951,36252,978,269,3695,11,951,4046,11943,484,2439,33073,17724,123537,5512,951,25664,36250,11,6033,35597,951,2211,484,41670,4046,585,5512,41199,1208,7479,409,21725,13,19421,41091,11,4864,3625,7591,376,9425,11,665,3625,74817,519,55398,81991,3625,21901,265,5019,3127,52424,3625,56086,11741,977,4014,417,1744,27750,938,8696,687,72,89810,13,3959,56086,1744,503,6,44803,325,76826,1880,1744,4864,9616,3869,1208,18528,409,326,6,1334,9049,5485,13,12623,51625,285,42625,11,503,6,44803,325,1208,12223,294,22827,56086,9024,11,514,865,978,6414,11,653,11917,324,887,63497,5019,77807,5615,466,1765,326,6,4775,483,409,326,6,266,8801,764,12339,13,3206,719,11,272,17771,39587,409,7591,23827,261,26077,955,409,938,8696,11741,977,4014,417,14848,18757,1469,90332,1765,10335,265,3625,56086,7930,17317,1218,283,8135,75804,88253,13,2998,21134,39381,11,503,34155,22209,978,514,865,978,6414,76354,7010,3625,938,8696,951,2848,17675,1759,409,1208,10335,265,1880,7930,1323,53377,3869,1208,7479,665,3460,519,1370,3625,4499,66,598,13,16233,18528,1826,3608,2428,3869,73103,3930,865,978,6414,991,652,3416,52235,7010,3625,36252,978,269,3695,13,77533,258,2439,1370,51173,1744,3846,865,978,6414,409,1208,10335,265,1880,951,36252,978,269,3695,45441,409,76651,12203,2957,13,13789,11,1647,80259,11,272,17771,1744,514,865,978,6414,57485,7010,326,6,1334,11,1744,17317,33515,2439,11,66090,409,326,6,266,8801,764,12339,11,308,26248,6502,1208,27584,18528,13,356,17771,22299,4502,11,8065,39381,294,93825,12203,2957,11,3900,43989,409,76651,67861,13,2582,11,42676,4864,1239,42441,1765,7643,27404,409,1069,396,554,11,7930,71925,6960,1208,4526,409,36252,978,269,3695,11,4864,100164,3930,12203,2957,11,4864,100164,27584,3930,85059,11,7930,8024,8065,56086,4046,34965,1370,514,13612,321,13,34447,503,34155,72006,6669,10670,26725,3625,32118,5317,288,2278,21041,11,3900,757,893,593,52842,42625,6316,15119,1557,409,12704,84,5019,3327,72684,20662,76651,67861,3930,865,978,6414,294,6,266,8801,764,12339,13,2998,220,1049,19,11,326,6,351,768,63983,20487,95199,26193,264,60630,978,6316,4538,451,9859,76,8047,16870,27625,5019,48908,665,5589,958,299,1414,6316,47838,8415,97193,409,5634,59307,11741,977,4014,417,13,11876,470,4558,2392,11,27750,30870,645,409,2840,580,1880,409,17258,784,20712,11,2800,14014,3197,447,14014,8065,1913,21901,3930,72601,2092,12267,41199,1208,85434,951,27138,13,362,39002,409,20662,4538,451,63983,20487,513,26483,85,1339,514,27584,14473,1744,66090,1744,503,49963,1082,3869,35336,5019,8678,805,514,865,978,6414,13,5767,17154,220,679,21,11,514,36543,18111,15878,76190,13,8242,29449,27404,409,1069,396,554,11,17317,57038,6316,4538,451,7930,1826,25945,36897,13,62293,20662,27404,409,1069,396,554,6669,68976,11,514,865,978,6414,951,470,4558,2392,44521,1339,6316,18528,12704,361,13,9648,55755,22011,11,1208,10335,265,11,1376,8047,409,5634,59307,92892,17724,10253,36252,978,269,3695,11,264,14707,15925,6316,14036,764,12339,3003,20487,409,76651,12203,2957,13,34447,3900,4498,1339,379,26514,2743,45889,281,2910,14014,62197,1924,409,12704,84,470,978,71237,5019,64290,404,829,18528,1180,31037,11,7930,296,41901,40142,20272,46131,951,5309,288,1880,951,6502,296,30872,417,13,5034,10335,265,1826,39587,5016,11,294,6,21068,359,834,593,27549,841,893,593,6502,294,6,1334,13,7695,8657,285,1339,409,43643,1553,15907,4020,77660,13,27058,85877,408,265,326,6,266,8801,764,12339,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,791,1495,374,264,36815,315,264,10652,922,279,6371,315,9420,596,16975,323,1268,433,706,28995,927,892,13,578,19114,16964,872,990,520,264,27692,1405,814,24564,23902,505,1023,33975,323,81260,11,2737,42142,3695,11,57811,10688,11,323,82128,23902,627,198,7009,4358,279,12939,315,53265,263,11,264,9024,6962,430,17482,439,264,65406,369,8830,279,6371,315,279,16975,13,2435,617,30239,279,53265,263,2262,304,23902,505,9420,596,43957,323,7863,433,311,279,53265,263,1766,304,42142,3695,11,902,706,459,20086,18528,13,4452,11,814,5296,430,279,53265,263,304,279,16975,374,2204,11,449,264,6307,819,49104,4619,315,279,14071,477,2579,8146,5938,449,279,42142,635,323,13238,20748,627,198,791,19114,13533,430,279,7554,6437,3777,4460,311,10552,279,6307,819,1933,315,45475,53265,263,1253,387,1766,304,470,1441,11,902,1051,12263,555,279,7665,11746,16784,596,16870,27625,42640,13,2435,1934,430,279,14473,389,4580,279,42640,16914,264,6437,58822,53265,263,12223,304,71086,10688,627,198,29815,389,420,9455,11,814,30714,430,9420,596,16975,1047,459,2926,14071,477,63244,819,40140,4245,311,279,10383,315,42142,3695,323,13238,20748,11,719,3010,19426,120
