Here's a breakdown of the main points:\n\n1. The presenter asks what is the most vital need for all living beings, and suggests that it is not food, sleep, but rather breathing pure air.\n2. The speaker notes that air pollution is responsible for the death of 7 million people worldwide each year, which is more than the number of deaths caused by tuberculosis, diabetes, and traffic accidents combined.\n3. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 9 out of 10 people breathe ambient air that is too polluted.\n4. The presenter emphasizes the importance of knowing the sources of atmospheric pollutants in order to develop strategies for reducing emissions.\n5. The speaker explains that their thesis aims to identify the origins of air pollutants and how they change as they move away from their source.\n6. Using an analogy about grouping people born in a specific region, the presenter illustrates how understanding the origin of air pollutants is key to developing effective reduction strategies.\n7. The speaker highlights the different stories or \"histories\" that air pollutants can tell about where they come from and what happens to them as they move away from their source.\n8. The presentation notes that air pollutants can also produce secondary pollutants, which are even more harmful than their parent pollutants and contribute to issues such as acid rain, climate change, and building degradation.\n9. Finally, the speaker encourages the audience to think about what they can do personally to improve the quality of the air they breathe.\n\nOverall, the presentation emphasizes the importance of understanding the sources and effects of air pollution in order to develop effective strategies for reducing its impact on human health and the environment.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,24082,263,9189,11,26077,1826,514,63669,514,5636,16595,5019,43905,23761,18434,5048,1744,326,54386,35456,25945,71151,5019,1645,9383,949,386,4091,949,98632,404,949,57895,40906,6502,13,356,17771,514,20272,409,33515,261,13,34447,6502,308,6,94896,26077,3805,13,1611,326,6,1334,4087,1880,2536,1499,72,13,921,20234,76132,11,1208,25793,409,326,6,1334,1826,77932,409,1208,10237,409,220,22,11990,409,48577,7010,514,38900,13,356,17771,5636,1744,3625,35881,12416,12454,360,5512,294,1220,28463,39015,13,362,1208,15286,69293,974,11,8065,1891,370,66522,1880,10253,33788,409,1208,6149,13,19421,65735,326,6,24105,8082,62940,20487,409,1208,77323,11,5636,409,220,24,48577,1765,220,605,9216,556,406,409,326,6,1334,9049,5485,21965,1499,72,13,4418,66,9189,62299,294,69537,541,9952,41091,1744,14707,74282,66014,3625,8336,951,7230,84,1821,14036,764,28154,14295,1826,25945,3062,13,3341,272,17771,1208,55133,14240,2070,7930,29557,2221,294,6,19010,4422,261,951,44397,19395,552,409,9517,23985,951,4046,5287,409,27750,7230,84,1821,13,356,17771,39043,1120,1133,326,6,1735,333,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,19421,5019,64972,514,60946,265,1131,14465,91507,9189,71751,653,51173,25945,4382,13,6433,981,2439,1744,326,54386,757,62163,409,1239,583,716,40744,3625,48577,308,14014,7010,653,27584,39381,74672,3257,2428,7010,20662,71632,13,27058,3846,20028,11,272,17771,4382,13,7695,8657,275,409,9189,1153,261,1208,3488,11,308,17771,54312,6502,949,1708,1105,682,2439,12303,13,24703,2249,7930,15132,308,5512,665,33150,424,68255,11,4864,9189,281,7379,294,31769,72905,3625,69236,13,25145,72,13,19421,66056,7930,15132,308,5512,264,4618,1759,949,25145,72,13,41621,45366,98004,805,3625,69236,13,43987,26178,11,91329,2182,89,52309,91640,13,24703,2249,7930,15132,308,5512,665,33150,424,68255,14848,1208,27584,2780,483,13,386,23034,4502,9189,308,6,90276,6502,409,1208,27584,67628,11,272,17771,514,27584,82660,3527,9952,11083,7230,84,1821,13,14465,7591,5098,483,43153,8336,294,31769,5287,11,39587,43153,2780,1572,11,665,3625,66517,519,89504,3869,7643,85722,11,3869,326,26248,579,294,6,412,8839,294,6,44803,325,71269,333,8467,13,48109,7930,841,74533,6502,308,5512,665,33150,424,68255,11,17317,308,49152,2439,6502,20272,514,27584,63128,295,5019,96586,49733,11,13080,11142,978,3625,123299,9004,52138,729,409,7710,13,2998,25500,11,17317,57038,951,77617,3946,96642,13,356,17771,1120,1133,27750,77617,3946,1744,4864,5320,2249,60946,265,9952,11083,7230,84,1821,665,9071,519,409,47929,3846,934,85217,3567,72,89810,37953,447,85217,274,31769,385,625,306,409,43153,8336,294,31769,5287,13,80905,22299,76076,294,6,40997,17317,7930,14848,45740,414,84,951,2960,33903,11,4160,556,951,2606,4918,409,15395,316,75104,5019,96586,3869,33150,424,68255,11,3625,7230,84,1821,56311,28463,45740,414,404,951,2960,33903,409,15395,316,75104,1880,7230,8977,294,81979,842,299,1220,13,81245,56311,44767,665,31278,466,951,90551,65,5512,7230,84,1821,16578,3869,951,9517,4109,38094,8467,7010,326,6,266,8801,764,12339,13,62463,90551,65,5512,7230,84,1821,11,76190,5512,7230,84,1821,2132,17724,11,15132,16968,28463,6033,35597,5636,76597,22589,1744,43153,6699,665,6044,28674,8065,1343,98078,48099,951,121696,552,1645,3422,11,8065,9517,6583,1386,1133,11323,266,2428,1880,27584,3869,1208,7591,49241,951,293,64272,12843,1880,951,27833,13,41621,23933,10333,934,6,2933,48226,6496,409,43153,3369,1441,76597,22589,1765,326,6,87713,1880,3625,4039,12249,11,1208,25793,409,326,6,1334,1826,28463,38605,69,5642,5019,326,41901,2842,40280,1880,514,11323,266,13,19421,5019,61512,11,389,841,25692,6502,513,550,1553,409,33515,261,11,308,17771,54312,6502,949,356,13059,519,11,389,25692,46939,1081,20099,3869,19830,14081,404,3625,82134,9517,12287,288,13,4418,66,11,33670,409,31632,3846,57992,11,503,6,2706,81356,1744,95917,359,409,17317,513,17477,20662,3488,25945,4382,13,14465,9189,22114,3869,48908,46131,1208,57146,409,1208,72709,463,331,8511,13,25145,72,13,5034,55133,3488,1826,25945,36897,13,3489,17771,54312,1744,4864,66517,5019,1097,73511,15171,1208,60128,409,326,6,1334,1744,4864,9216,556,949,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,791,1495,8111,311,387,264,36815,315,264,15864,477,8982,922,3805,25793,323,1202,6372,389,3823,2890,323,279,4676,13,5810,596,264,31085,315,279,1925,3585,512,198,16,13,578,34756,17501,1148,374,279,1455,16595,1205,369,682,5496,23837,11,323,13533,430,433,374,539,3691,11,6212,11,719,4856,27027,10748,3805,13,198,17,13,578,19114,8554,430,3805,25793,374,8647,369,279,4648,315,220,22,3610,1274,15603,1855,1060,11,902,374,810,1109,279,1396,315,16779,9057,555,88234,11,20335,11,323,9629,33788,11093,13,198,18,13,10771,311,279,4435,6401,21021,320,78847,705,810,1109,220,24,704,315,220,605,1274,37397,35288,3805,430,374,2288,95869,13,198,19,13,578,34756,66159,279,12939,315,14392,279,8336,315,45475,83661,304,2015,311,2274,15174,369,18189,20748,13,198,20,13,578,19114,15100,430,872,17850,22262,311,10765,279,33472,315,3805,83661,323,1268,814,2349,439,814,3351,3201,505,872,259
