{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-11-19T13:36:16.308378569Z","response":"It looks like you have a transcript of a lecture or presentation on the topic of climate change and its impact on biodiversity, specifically in relation to animal size. The speaker seems to be discussing the concept of Bergman's rule, which states that larger animals tend to live in colder climates.\n\nThe transcript appears to cover several key points:\n\n1. The relationship between animal size and temperature: the speaker notes that large animals are better adapted to hot temperatures than small ones.\n2. The importance of physical factors (such as body mass) in determining an animal's ability to survive in a given climate.\n3. The impact of climate change on biodiversity: the speaker suggests that some species may adapt by changing their size or activity patterns, while others may struggle to survive.\n\nThe transcript also includes several examples and anecdotes, including a personal experience where the speaker noted that their coffee cooled down faster than their cafeti√®re due to differences in thermal mass.\n\nOverall, the transcript appears to be discussing the complex interplay between climate change, animal size, and biodiversity, highlighting the importance of considering these factors when studying the impact of climate change on ecosystems.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,1252,9880,11,389,264,84228,64591,1744,39015,39723,3900,20272,70412,11,653,10065,39015,1481,300,1826,71151,40970,25500,13,9424,688,46206,3625,297,1082,12249,6033,35597,46206,3625,36041,333,31539,13,393,1466,2439,1370,51173,653,11604,1499,12267,13,47643,2005,63484,1826,5636,25500,1744,4538,36271,665,8560,2852,648,13,64105,64,272,17771,653,51173,11741,23034,11,10071,39043,15572,68,28463,49733,11,665,56747,12279,6809,11,3869,12366,11,39723,3900,20272,653,28800,9165,4558,451,13,7695,35737,40970,25500,1744,4538,259,546,263,8065,83259,409,1208,17360,4558,451,13,24703,308,17771,6502,6316,3190,24812,409,27389,7611,45973,3625,924,5192,4804,11,272,17771,1208,83229,3491,409,31782,1543,13,2998,6160,540,978,3257,648,11,3900,22011,1744,3625,94527,22641,306,64972,1208,523,61047,1744,3625,86696,13,4418,66,274,35329,20272,70412,1744,9964,1560,21965,25500,11,9964,10025,14295,6316,17508,700,74696,13,622,41901,16796,20272,326,6,4683,65679,11,9165,729,11,6502,5636,62197,934,39982,1291,13,11583,259,13559,409,53050,2098,1607,275,5636,83457,1744,1208,30203,295,20712,13,4418,66,951,4046,19926,30945,8467,13,445,6496,4864,9189,1370,273,409,64441,11,10071,3900,29253,28463,951,2144,38647,6160,1640,8467,13,46706,514,30281,11,42676,326,6,2530,3460,11,3900,20272,653,282,1607,19266,85,12339,13,7695,308,59858,264,5636,55455,3869,296,4091,11,39587,9964,757,1759,665,305,1553,13,34447,4502,9964,1560,5636,6800,11,9964,439,5636,409,31807,13583,13,5250,332,85815,1744,39015,9964,1765,2749,11,8941,34922,1826,6316,712,25108,668,409,78548,13,1611,326,31769,447,11067,5553,3625,281,9769,645,11,4502,503,34155,14707,13550,285,11,272,17771,514,11323,266,7930,6155,57332,13,19421,274,35329,20272,282,1607,11,9964,6800,285,13,34447,87320,949,23126,729,11,272,17771,1377,57332,11,4864,9189,1370,273,409,39043,75804,88253,13,14465,91507,9189,89504,409,11323,266,11,10071,76776,409,2798,14081,1598,13,41621,3665,89,25692,85815,1744,514,11323,266,2349,1880,1744,3625,27138,15132,294,1759,13,9605,20272,1208,56594,1986,13109,3663,8065,2609,1133,11323,266,2428,949,61651,14707,11,39043,7591,3825,951,16948,4558,1634,11,1370,86633,272,17771,13859,266,2428,13,39783,3488,5019,23589,265,11,4068,46524,3930,282,1607,949,4418,66,11,30870,713,2439,5553,514,31837,13,2009,48734,11,39043,35737,40970,70412,39015,1481,300,13,19421,272,17771,1208,55133,951,9517,23475,11,62439,409,2035,13,5034,56594,1986,13109,75871,665,2349,519,7010,326,77025,1330,13,34447,4068,4864,66517,4502,4864,841,94297,6502,30870,1414,949,29749,308,6,300,934,81991,7591,64184,9637,84411,536,294,6,9035,13109,13,5034,296,2227,51111,11,1370,51173,11,20272,15907,60404,5636,259,35657,13,2009,92942,523,13559,5636,62197,7010,1208,85434,5019,523,3376,951,15975,2469,13,19421,272,17771,1208,26633,90272,951,9517,23475,8065,9517,6583,1386,1133,13,5034,56594,1986,13109,75871,665,2349,519,7010,514,27138,13,14465,5320,2249,14707,11,22011,514,85059,2427,6809,11,10071,3900,379,264,653,490,1791,7930,757,342,5615,818,13,11583,84411,536,294,6,9035,13109,1826,29059,8047,7010,11083,342,4558,4978,13,2998,5636,11,7643,47276,11,1647,39646,1826,49733,13,64105,64,841,87264,6502,5636,4382,4502,503,31769,2629,285,70374,5636,46110,13,19421,272,17771,1208,8348,13532,25253,951,9517,23475,8065,2609,1133,11323,266,2428,13,5034,56594,1986,13109,75871,7010,3625,20934,598,4046,39624,10515,8467,13,19421,272,17771,3846,1765,75249,2700,306,11083,58673,2249,409,38317,13,1952,829,275,74699,1744,514,11323,266,1880,1208,62827,15132,409,296,4558,1557,13,34447,4502,514,11323,266,2349,7010,514,27138,11,3625,4039,12249,82133,12,8839,62439,409,62827,5019,3154,519,949,27058,514,47929,11,4864,91507,75144,653,51173,13,1952,69152,653,51655,409,46681,38883,11,951,98733,17724,7930,11083,77065,951,297,1082,12249,7010,43905,1208,9822,13,11246,92759,519,11,27750,77617,3946,409,86696,1880,409,94527,13,34447,5019,1208,56594,1986,13109,11,834,1474,6870,11,665,75249,272,17771,3062,949,61651,14707,11,665,27750,27138,409,25626,23851,11323,266,2428,11,1208,62827,11412,62439,26725,3625,20934,598,4046,39624,10515,8467,13,46408,7958,68,1208,7550,648,951,16948,4558,1634,1765,10335,265,13,64105,64,25692,27584,62439,9637,2035,7010,1208,13826,25108,818,38450,12267,13,5034,24408,33537,8047,3869,1208,62827,27750,36852,4918,27138,11,27549,20605,68,13,19421,272,3433,10333,31307,6033,6502,11,1208,62827,11,39043,42463,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5992,1093,499,617,264,36815,315,264,31678,477,15864,389,279,8712,315,10182,2349,323,1202,5536,389,73119,11,11951,304,12976,311,10065,1404,13,578,19114,5084,311,387,25394,279,7434,315,31782,1543,596,6037,11,902,5415,430,8294,10099,8541,311,3974,304,76214,92399,627,198,791,36815,8111,311,3504,3892,1401,3585,512,198,16,13,578,5133,1990,10065,1404,323,9499,25,279,19114,8554,430,3544,10099,527,2731,30464,311,4106,20472,1109,2678,6305,13,198,17,13,578,12939,315,7106,9547,320,21470,439,2547,3148,8,304,26679,459,10065,596,5845,311,
