{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-11-19T13:32:01.505835444Z","response":"A fascinating story! It appears to be a French text about a blacksmith who is struggling to produce high-quality parts, but then decides to use his own industrial presses and experiments with different settings to improve the process. He discovers that by using lasers and measuring devices, he can optimize his production and eliminate defects.\n\nThe story highlights the importance of experimentation, innovation, and perseverance in overcoming challenges. The blacksmith's decision to rely on his own expertise and resources rather than seeking outside help is a bold move that ultimately leads to success.\n\nSome interesting points from the text include:\n\n* The use of industrial presses as a means of improving production quality\n* The development of new techniques and tools, such as laser measurement devices\n* The importance of experimentation and testing in refining a process\n* The value of independence and self-reliance in overcoming challenges\n\nOverall, this is an inspiring story that celebrates the power of human ingenuity and the importance of taking calculated risks to achieve success.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,7695,43989,6316,37291,11,7010,653,938,7911,3972,781,396,467,11,653,490,17194,369,1414,263,7930,80664,1339,3709,7770,13,24703,34300,40351,11,665,67781,11,43989,14707,8126,49530,978,13,7695,841,1370,1055,1339,6502,3869,6316,51651,60128,13,350,5612,3625,70477,1634,934,35329,57728,1339,11,2145,11,1841,2785,1157,11,2995,1466,1154,11,97958,40744,2098,355,14014,1880,296,5014,3869,1208,7591,14215,13,356,96287,15878,294,2182,1208,2267,1088,3869,15907,47590,13,39783,14240,2070,100243,7930,513,20272,665,1097,546,13,2009,36252,278,934,35329,57728,1339,14240,519,8811,76773,978,11,15907,4631,4558,70,1157,25400,97057,13,12769,2722,4160,321,6496,8126,49530,978,949,435,2852,39587,76190,3869,17317,7930,57038,951,12933,71269,689,1001,27389,85,1157,5019,951,1367,28154,2436,35018,13,2998,1296,519,8941,36252,278,11,9964,5019,13075,11,15878,3577,290,11,7970,3125,8941,83597,1880,51309,47590,13,8345,34447,514,369,1414,263,22011,3869,64160,17274,11,12769,14465,5320,2249,20028,11083,4043,2852,1765,1685,325,67965,6853,13,11583,270,4558,325,1826,1744,4864,94297,9952,11478,7684,2058,326,6,266,68249,5019,5636,294,6,485,978,3825,685,13,12095,503,6,1138,535,9952,11083,54063,409,220,20,296,75104,409,62321,8065,27584,65285,266,1744,11083,281,17724,8065,10278,78,11,45602,1647,376,2473,934,35329,1826,3284,11,37572,64972,11,409,513,45347,409,70375,951,7177,834,3825,53819,13,8345,7695,4685,64,1765,15907,54063,13,1252,2107,668,324,10737,978,5019,11083,7889,8065,64972,3625,9045,68866,5512,13,19421,9952,56321,72475,1765,326,6,412,48164,348,1056,978,11,272,17771,1208,7591,1659,934,35329,264,18757,11083,7889,13,7695,1367,14081,3904,64,15907,54063,1765,978,36847,14014,1765,409,69406,43021,485,417,35881,13649,5512,7010,326,6,54553,13,2009,1296,71132,52235,11,4382,10071,6502,15858,17194,11,4046,5192,300,1339,3625,43021,485,417,9465,26633,12235,12249,326,85460,13,2009,369,1414,263,26483,6723,11,77433,3869,20662,88411,11,3625,1719,75104,3930,83597,8791,458,3869,829,8198,13,5767,72,514,84129,1880,3625,70477,1634,2536,26965,288,11,40744,27750,47590,97958,665,5589,10253,7617,288,13,34447,9465,27138,11,15907,4631,4558,70,1157,384,77065,1913,72,43153,4043,2852,13,19421,294,81979,1719,75104,282,77065,26483,85,5512,9952,94499,13,34447,5019,514,27584,5634,28154,2933,949,27058,514,27584,83597,949,356,8458,841,513,25692,13,7930,1826,514,5636,33204,51453,949,64027,4631,4558,70,1157,3930,10278,78,13,356,17771,42676,27584,28130,30870,9363,13,34447,3625,91329,7183,9465,84440,841,15132,6502,409,21965,13,62293,45889,9045,1880,45889,65838,11,653,9880,3355,61799,514,27138,39723,16968,35737,9517,6200,978,13,2009,369,1414,263,31736,275,39587,4538,42775,1880,3900,45165,10453,77818,2249,1880,84871,409,86696,10896,1900,13,5767,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,32,27387,3446,0,1102,8111,311,387,264,8753,1495,922,264,3776,34117,889,374,20558,311,8356,1579,22867,5596,11,719,1243,28727,311,1005,813,1866,13076,54063,323,21896,449,2204,5110,311,7417,279,1920,13,1283,52114,430,555,1701,72475,323,30090,7766,11,568,649,30536,813,5788,323,22472,42655,627,198,791,3446,22020,279,12939,315,66196,11,19297,11,323,99841,304,74017,11774,13,578,3776,34117,596,5597,311,17631,389,813,1866,19248,323,5070,4856,1109,11125,4994,1520,374,264,14265,3351,430,13967,11767,311,2450,627,198,8538,7185,3585,505,279,1495,2997,1473,9,578,1005,315,13076,54063,439,264,3445,315,18899,5788,4367,198,9,578,4500,315,502,12823,323,7526,11,1778,439,21120,19179,7766,198,9,578,12939,315,66196,323,7649,304,74285,264,1920,198,9,578,907,315,24589,323,659,5621,747,685,304,74017,11774,198,198,28589,11,420,374,459,34147,3446,430,49193,279,2410,315,3823,6892,90589,323,279,12939,315,4737,16997,15635,311,11322,2450,13,128009],"total_duration":6947236542,"load_duration":247542,"prompt_eval_count":563,"prompt_eval_duration":1112248000,"eval_count":196,"eval_duration":5834176000}
