They use an analogy with a \"palace of ice\" where people navigate through a labyrinth by touching and feeling their way around. Similarly, when designing a water filter, one needs to find the optimal arrangement of filtering materials to remove pollutants from the water.\n\nThe speaker explains that they are working on a thesis project that uses mathematical optimization techniques to design an optimal filtration system. They describe how they break down the problem into smaller parts, define the objectives and constraints, and use a computer code to simulate different scenarios and find the best solution.\n\n**Translation:**\n\n[Me, I'm doing topological optimization to find the optimal arrangement of materials in a filter, with the goal of de-polluting water. It looks complicated, but I can explain it to you. You see the ice palace? That's the attraction we often see at fairgrounds. The goal is to find the exit. To do this, one must navigate through a maze formed by a set of transparent partitions. And generally, since one wants to avoid bumping into things and ending up with a lump on their forehead, one uses their hands and feels their way around. Okay, here's a partition, I'll stop. Okay, it's empty, I can move forward. Finally, you see what I'm trying to say. One progresses by touching the walls and leaving finger marks on the glass surfaces. Actually, a child who enters with dirty hands could even end up with clean hands at the exit, thanks to all the feeling around. That's what we call absorption. The dirt on their hands has stuck to the surface of the partitions. And if one amused themselves by arranging the entire set of partitions so that each person who enters circulates in a certain way and leaves with clean hands? Well, that's what I'm doing in my thesis. But for me, the ice palace is a kind of box where it's not people who move around, but water. And in this box, it's not partitions that one places, but filtering materials. When the water flows through these materials, pollutants will absorb onto them, just like finger marks. And at the exit, the water will contain fewer pollutants. Now, how do we arrange these filtering materials? At random, I put some here, none there, and two over there. You think that's not it. We need a better method. That's what I'm working on in my thesis. This method is... It's topological optimization. It's about placing the materials to achieve goals, which are reducing pollutant concentrations in water and using the minimum amount of materials possible. All while taking into account the constraints that apply to me, such as how water flows and transports pollutants. To find the best arrangement of these filtering materials within this box, I use mathematics. How? First, I set out objectives and constraints in the form of equations. Then, I divide the interior of my box into several small volumes. And I introduce a design variable into my equations. Finally, I integrate everything into a calculation code. This code allows me to place or not place a filtering material in each small volume of the box, depending on the value of the design variable. Thus, in my thesis, I am developing a method that combines physics and mathematics to one day build a completely optimized water filter.]","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,6178,72,11,4864,66517,409,326,6,19680,8082,1948,1640,2428,5019,46524,326,6,351,967,1133,23669,409,5634,20712,7010,653,1488,10367,11,7010,514,719,409,7591,31241,8977,409,326,93847,13,1219,2727,39043,11,39043,264,326,6,1334,4684,76366,11,10071,4864,94297,9189,326,6,30992,72684,13,41621,23933,10333,514,11091,2852,951,2840,2492,949,356,17771,20662,33464,934,54386,4160,275,71151,7010,3625,282,90276,369,33903,13,2009,719,949,42782,424,1208,84143,13,27058,45602,11,3900,47090,30517,261,653,326,58437,1820,1376,978,1370,653,40126,409,5405,19941,18300,288,13,19421,46680,969,1001,11,22299,389,76605,51913,2058,409,513,62666,1215,1880,409,513,38831,15170,9952,6316,43746,325,1765,514,4156,11,389,69152,15907,69236,1880,389,259,9011,783,818,13,7777,11,49733,3900,379,264,6316,5405,3416,11,4864,296,6,1138,37093,13,7777,11,49733,272,17771,23895,11,4864,94297,1860,11967,13,2998,5589,11,9189,23933,10333,3846,1744,4864,5320,2249,13510,13,1952,463,18297,325,8065,3729,951,1370,30148,1880,389,379,93569,951,35483,409,656,343,2641,1765,3625,13458,417,13,423,6,52009,1759,11,653,33632,519,7930,11751,261,1339,9952,3625,69236,6763,92215,27584,513,38831,15170,3869,1208,84143,9952,3625,69236,2047,417,13,65381,5457,409,259,9011,783,40280,13,64105,64,11,272,17771,3846,934,54386,917,6853,326,6,3518,66181,13,11876,4371,1056,1439,1765,15907,69236,513,15132,5155,14014,1765,1208,7479,951,5405,19941,13,19421,4502,389,274,6,56455,1339,3869,834,20672,326,6,49575,951,5405,19941,5019,1744,46777,54613,7930,9465,4319,1130,294,31109,3738,68,85722,1880,594,7003,68,3625,69236,2047,417,949,61651,14707,11,272,17771,3846,1744,4864,66517,7010,7643,270,4558,325,13,34447,5019,41091,11,514,11091,2852,951,2840,2492,11,272,17771,6316,80444,409,712,25108,668,7010,1208,88265,3846,841,15132,6502,3625,48577,7930,4319,29580,11,10071,409,326,93847,13,19421,7010,20662,712,25108,668,11,3846,841,15132,6502,951,5405,19941,1744,326,54386,2035,11,10071,951,86374,4298,2249,51791,1821,13,3489,438,326,93847,4319,1130,8065,3729,409,27750,86374,4298,2249,11,3625,7230,84,1821,82133,274,59858,15938,655,11,16968,22299,3625,35483,409,656,343,2641,13,19421,3869,1208,84143,11,326,93847,687,72,61799,40970,409,7230,84,1821,13,43987,26178,11,4068,389,945,768,27750,86374,4298,2249,51791,1821,949,33150,706,569,11,49733,503,41901,296,1441,6316,11,49733,503,41901,296,1441,6502,11,1880,49733,503,41901,296,1441,26633,13,41621,73953,89,14707,1744,2536,13,7695,17317,47090,6316,94721,98652,13,356,17771,3846,1765,75249,4864,42775,273,7010,7643,270,4558,325,13,62408,98652,11,272,17771,1131,356,17771,326,6,19680,8082,1948,1640,2428,13,7695,274,6,74972,409,834,20672,3625,86374,4298,2249,5019,93381,71933,951,1665,22589,11,7930,15132,48416,8977,1208,20545,951,7230,84,1821,7010,326,93847,11,1880,75144,514,40970,409,86374,4298,2249,3284,13,80905,665,864,52985,665,42463,3625,6155,1673,288,7930,274,98279,981,306,3869,41091,11,22299,1208,85722,15890,326,93847,4319,1130,1880,96488,3625,7230,84,1821,13,27058,46524,1208,94721,46096,409,27750,86374,4298,2249,51791,1821,7010,20662,712,25108,668,11,503,49963,1082,3625,7033,978,8637,8467,13,12535,949,14465,296,1441,294,6,370,541,3625,1665,22589,1880,3625,6155,1673,288,11,32592,1208,57128,294,31769,447,811,13,2998,51092,11,4864,59148,375,326,55624,57663,409,7643,712,25108,668,665,51854,86696,27378,13,19421,503,55624,4653,285,7010,11083,4046,447,811,3846,1744,326,54386,917,6853,6316,3977,409,43656,13,2998,5589,11,503,55624,4558,15893,514,16968,7010,653,2082,409,5935,13,356,17771,3846,2082,7930,29557,11,46932,519,1208,51304,409,1208,3977,409,43656,11,409,72796,6033,2536,653,5634,28154,2933,51791,519,7010,46777,46110,8286,409,1208,712,25108,668,13,362,32384,11,7010,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,52895,375,6316,98652,7930,682,648,1208,64441,1880,3625,7033,978,8637,8467,5019,653,9880,11,9189,19477,52750,653,1488,10367,3869,384,2933,94773,7706,69068,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,8586,374,279,36815,449,264,10015,12399,323,14807,1473,9,9,3936,68063,31197,4954,7054,5848,7127,369,10164,16807,376,367,198,198,334,83136,68063,578,3229,315,279,17850,11,25394,872,3495,389,74142,1948,5848,2955,369,3090,76038,382,9,9,19791,68063,198,198,791,19114,43565,9455,279,23669,27204,315,7384,304,264,4141,311,60499,264,36196,13,2435,1005,459,56203,449,264,330,19866,580,315,10054,1,1405,1274,21546,1555,264,99810,555,31687,323,8430,872,1648,2212,13,35339,11,994,30829,264,3090,4141,11,832,3966,311,1505,279,23669,27204,315,30770,7384,311,4148,83661,505,279,3090,627,198,791,19114,15100,430,814,527,3318,389,264,17850,2447,430,5829,37072,26329,12823,311,2955,459,23669,76038,1887,13,2435,7664,1268,814,1464,1523,279,3575,1139,9333,5596,11,7124,279,26470,323,17413,11,323,1005,264,6500,2082,311,38553,2204,26350,323,1505,279,1888,6425,382,9,9,25416,68063,198,198,58,7979,11,358,2846,3815,1948,5848,26329,311,1505,279,23669,27204,315,7384,304,264,4141,11,449,279,5915,315,409,2320,980,10831,3090,13,
