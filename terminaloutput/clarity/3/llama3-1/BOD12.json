The author is discussing the concept of \"naître avec une cuillère d'argent dans la bouche,\" which translates to \"being born with a silver spoon in one's mouth.\" This phrase refers to being born into a wealthy and privileged family, which gives one an advantage in life.\n\nThe author then applies this concept to a study on house sparrows. They are exploring whether certain individuals within the species have an equivalent of a \"silver spoon\" - namely, parents who provide them with ideal conditions for growth and development. The author is investigating how stress, or the absence of a \"cuillère d'argent,\" affects the health of young sparrows.\n\nThe study involved raising two groups of house sparrow chicks: one group was raised under stressful conditions, while the other group was raised in ideal conditions with plenty of food and no stress. The author then measured various aspects of the adult birds' attractiveness, such as the length of their beards (which are considered attractive to females), as well as their reproductive success.\n\nThe results show that birds raised without a \"cuillère d'argent\" have smaller beards, but they are actually more successful at producing offspring. Despite having less mating success, they produce larger and more numerous chicks than the control group.\n\nOverall, the author is arguing that having a \"cuillère d'argent\" is not necessarily a guarantee of reproductive success in house sparrows.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,10467,89,45325,3846,1744,1879,57609,326,6,29199,12769,4415,66014,9952,6316,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,7010,1208,30870,1557,8345,949,46408,97583,265,514,20272,934,22827,23496,84,11,53066,294,31109,67628,436,12333,11,40142,16968,3846,934,35329,25400,47090,5019,59394,653,7970,76235,7010,1208,17536,13,7695,35737,15878,85624,294,2182,653,56430,72006,11,6800,11,12108,11,10071,76776,665,7245,483,77323,13,13789,11,10071,26077,1826,514,55520,9465,20662,87810,409,7015,484,12339,1880,3625,4647,483,12249,74522,8467,949,61651,14707,272,17771,16968,326,41901,3841,84,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,7591,23827,261,4502,11,46206,3625,4647,483,12249,28463,11,76076,23496,355,56311,4415,66014,9952,6316,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,7010,514,106508,13,1708,1105,11,4068,25692,10539,7591,5589,404,6316,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,5019,653,17258,784,258,409,4647,483,2933,949,27058,653,17258,784,258,11,272,17771,951,6699,6666,77,5512,7930,73661,79738,653,1689,991,16491,5019,20028,28130,72039,3869,326,6,370,462,951,27389,1045,1759,13,34447,272,17771,28463,653,72006,13612,321,11,653,39646,436,12333,665,27080,288,1880,951,100164,1354,6502,21965,1437,4168,1821,13,445,1105,593,326,22827,409,27750,33013,98942,1826,893,31548,11,1370,51173,11,1208,5103,6853,308,17771,6502,35597,13254,409,4538,39646,11,1880,514,8811,1826,21965,10366,978,3869,19266,1072,556,294,81979,5103,37907,11,3625,17258,784,1354,15132,1208,1056,5512,513,14630,8065,72039,11,3869,1208,16888,72,951,27389,1045,1759,1880,3611,309,5512,13,19421,45602,2605,61652,653,8631,46206,3625,17258,784,1354,13,19421,514,8631,11,9189,665,5804,72,408,23577,11,3846,308,17771,6502,25945,7970,5019,1208,77323,13,622,57286,664,648,39587,5636,51625,285,42625,4068,3846,8631,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,20662,19821,409,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,11,85434,3869,1208,77323,951,17258,784,1354,13,27058,45602,11,17317,57038,4046,3532,978,951,17258,784,1354,409,4647,483,12249,13,81245,14848,24560,9517,4581,285,665,26633,1912,288,12742,82,13,11876,17258,784,1354,3930,21134,57951,14848,312,79884,10878,519,28130,14425,24918,951,45555,2396,294,52152,9885,288,15921,14014,9952,6316,36908,409,8631,25945,9517,79,438,361,46206,3625,297,1082,12249,11,1208,23100,292,537,14081,606,13,356,8458,264,14175,285,294,6,19729,479,261,28130,53052,409,8631,11,14843,285,519,44351,3846,7930,513,39904,5019,653,17258,784,258,4046,3532,978,15878,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,13,11876,17258,784,1354,3930,2132,57951,14848,10484,3869,84440,312,79884,951,45555,2396,294,52152,9885,288,7138,13,81245,14848,39587,24560,4046,3532,5512,7010,951,4787,887,978,3916,11,15878,8631,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,9952,6316,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,7010,514,106508,13,39783,37291,409,1055,355,88025,11,503,34155,14240,21178,978,4068,514,20272,294,49152,13603,24560,47371,3372,285,5512,6033,2536,10878,519,28130,14425,24918,28068,1339,1765,28130,9504,344,13109,1877,31037,1880,28130,23878,13109,3869,409,43406,409,82134,6699,13,1708,1105,11,4068,20272,10539,5019,47929,4502,653,4647,483,2933,1826,72006,342,437,325,949,432,3675,409,5636,4382,13,11876,296,9011,645,4647,483,12249,57485,306,6316,3703,1395,13,19421,11,22299,46206,3625,2854,1771,11,3625,3703,10551,15132,77554,14081,5512,22299,3625,5636,11124,13,622,34155,39587,11083,324,978,1208,1317,79623,409,27750,3703,9620,1880,503,34155,5363,978,7930,951,4647,483,12249,409,12155,26633,1912,288,50590,3625,5636,38546,13,27058,4046,838,8977,3625,20697,21237,2748,3916,951,4647,483,12249,11,503,34155,42587,978,951,12823,409,71132,13,622,34155,55056,978,514,13026,409,86696,934,85217,2558,10994,1188,10878,519,6316,76132,11,44351,1744,1208,62827,1880,514,97418,409,15907,17258,784,1354,13,19421,8065,1620,11,934,17771,54312,1744,39043,264,33537,978,949,622,34155,9466,978,1744,3625,4647,483,12249,7930,308,6,2979,1188,6502,312,79884,409,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,7010,514,106508,10878,519,28130,14425,24918,84764,1188,951,3703,9620,5636,98385,11,39587,46152,97958,40970,11124,1744,43153,1391,31539,13,27058,61512,11,1880,272,17771,39015,653,65285,266,25945,92759,519,11,8811,90966,514,20272,934,85217,264,1188,40970,409,17393,409,2605,78,16339,653,16081,409,272,89412,46206,6316,5103,6853,11,87158,66090,63484,513,54206,11,46152,14848,6316,3703,1395,5636,38920,1744,28130,1391,12339,13,19421,665,5636,11,46152,82133,2558,556,951,17258,784,1354,5636,25500,1880,665,5636,6800,13026,1744,43153,1391,1590,288,13,362,32384,11,6502,63669,409,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,5019,409,43406,653,7970,312,3107,12844,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2028,1495,8111,311,387,264,17850,9232,477,15864,11,5439,304,8753,13,578,3229,374,25394,279,7434,315,330,3458,66014,9952,6316,7015,484,12339,294,6,77217,7010,1208,30870,1557,1359,902,48018,311,330,35214,9405,449,264,15310,46605,304,832,596,11013,1210,1115,17571,19813,311,1694,9405,1139,264,28994,323,47361,3070,11,902,6835,832,459,9610,304,2324,627,198,791,3229,1243,17208,420,7434,311,264,4007,389,383
