{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-11-19T13:25:49.627447443Z","response":"This appears to be a transcript of a lecture or presentation on the topic of anthropology, specifically the author's experiences conducting research among the Tibetan population in the Himalayas. The text is written in French, and it discusses the concept of \"immersion\" in anthropology, where researchers engage with local populations and immerse themselves in their daily lives.\n\nThe author describes her own experience living with a family in a small village at an altitude of 35,000 meters, where she participated in everyday activities, learned the local language, and formed connections with the people. She notes that this was part of her research methodology, which involved observational participation.\n\nThe text also discusses the author's research focus on the evolution of traditional Tibetan medicine, specifically the practices of two doctors, Yeshi and Norbu, who run a family clinic in their home. The author observes an important intergenerational gap between the two doctors, with Yeshi having learned from his father and Norbu having received formal training in a Tibetan medical school.\n\nThe text highlights the ways in which globalization and modernization have influenced the traditional practices of these doctors, particularly Norbu's increasing involvement in Western medicine. The author notes that this has led to innovations in their practice, such as the production of medicinal incense for sale to tourists.\n\nThe lecture concludes by emphasizing the importance of anthropology in understanding how societies evolve and change over time. The author suggests that immersion in \"terra unknown\" (unknown territory) is essential for gaining a deeper understanding of what makes us human.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,7695,379,264,6316,4046,2796,43116,7930,274,53149,6853,12769,432,73602,45325,665,88026,304,5259,361,8345,7010,1208,88265,6316,272,29982,32414,978,961,274,6,19519,1414,7010,1208,17536,294,31109,7187,781,396,8511,13,23126,729,11,39043,757,61158,6853,3846,1744,4864,66517,11,10071,1208,2373,2536,32118,8747,266,2428,11,326,6,32329,897,38469,13,445,6,32329,897,38469,274,55624,978,22550,665,67781,10253,96642,30811,65970,2854,33903,1880,17317,22114,3869,48021,665,13356,29449,83187,3941,409,17536,13,19421,41091,11,27549,1826,39723,7643,88026,304,5259,361,949,38891,89,11,409,38546,20605,3326,288,665,818,343,14014,11,653,14458,3869,220,1758,410,296,75104,294,6,99111,11,6316,7187,8065,436,556,51794,11,3869,1208,49361,5954,77,37093,11,65198,11,4160,556,272,287,75,5048,11,17317,74533,7010,653,14458,409,326,68070,2931,12874,13,356,17771,39015,1481,300,1744,503,34155,81621,56321,37291,11,51854,46415,11,3869,18434,265,665,75657,7010,6316,7187,294,6,4775,483,259,581,10515,8511,294,41901,2842,220,3101,14464,1821,13,622,34155,25160,9952,27750,47104,11,1048,951,2807,417,9952,27750,47104,11,44314,978,28130,96282,13,27058,62998,949,4366,346,1744,272,17771,1208,98652,409,38317,409,1647,96839,294,57286,29246,11,326,6,79060,5293,5048,13,1952,1370,273,9952,3625,47104,11,389,3625,2322,665,2389,5397,1880,46152,17317,7591,34667,8135,6316,49361,5954,77,37093,13,13789,11,4864,841,9189,6636,6502,1744,514,21134,3729,1826,653,28800,77411,13,14465,757,5945,10176,729,11,4864,9189,16796,665,5589,1448,680,978,3869,1208,60172,294,22827,14458,30148,42676,11,6502,409,90509,13,1252,47838,14458,30148,39904,1880,757,22011,11,665,20272,11,13088,6868,285,6853,11,3900,47090,5790,95920,11,3900,841,47090,6502,1448,3183,13,622,6,40997,11,503,6,1683,6091,7010,1208,36105,44526,20487,11,99309,20043,2249,436,51058,757,5363,306,294,22827,3805,37539,11067,13,1952,296,6,10543,68,1913,54960,11,389,757,113147,514,76680,1880,5636,503,41901,66304,11,5636,389,296,41901,594,805,265,13,14465,841,11427,2852,6502,4068,5790,95920,11,4864,841,63762,5636,4068,31632,13,34447,1913,54960,11,4864,36731,1370,7287,3869,18434,265,7010,20662,67628,7010,1208,88265,3900,379,264,26633,32118,8332,1354,259,581,10515,1771,11,816,4385,72,514,281,12339,1880,8170,20218,514,89672,11,7930,55744,5118,306,6316,32118,8332,483,409,28130,14135,259,581,10515,8511,13,19421,272,17771,39043,7930,296,55624,978,22550,13,62463,26633,32118,8332,1354,55744,5118,306,7010,28130,47276,1880,3381,43153,35030,292,24469,3869,2385,409,6136,288,10253,447,37907,46152,14848,1046,12416,13,19421,7643,270,4558,325,60172,1765,326,31769,65272,951,92096,409,3846,47929,35030,950,13,19421,1765,3846,7930,2349,9465,1208,95234,409,816,4385,72,11,514,281,12339,11,1880,409,8170,20218,11,514,89672,13,4418,66,934,17771,54312,1744,503,6,49133,949,622,6,49133,665,20272,653,26495,978,958,70,32453,2214,8301,3062,13,816,4385,72,11,514,281,12339,11,264,917,6091,8065,14458,9952,4538,281,12339,28463,13,1708,1105,1744,4538,89672,8170,20218,264,18757,48908,7010,6316,4046,56745,409,32118,8332,483,259,581,10515,8511,11,3900,264,15925,1046,12416,3869,653,47929,5636,3544,1880,3900,264,18757,23933,1435,665,20522,1748,13,19421,75804,88253,11,3900,45640,1880,3900,95234,409,5636,665,5636,665,20522,1748,13,7695,513,17302,68,3869,409,80080,58395,3930,38900,934,35329,39474,68,3869,4538,14458,13,24703,7930,20272,1744,829,14135,6301,1009,13,4418,66,3900,11412,1370,51173,11,20028,665,5636,409,15907,35030,292,24469,11,409,326,6,967,729,35030,292,992,934,35329,19189,10253,31070,288,409,21765,13,3489,301,593,14896,1744,4538,281,12339,308,26248,6502,3930,16968,917,43711,5979,978,8065,65385,11,10071,934,35329,264,4287,978,46110,3869,46110,13,435,2259,1001,11,816,4385,72,11,514,281,12339,11,757,22011,1744,97507,11,14707,97717,11,1208,17536,8065,14458,75804,88253,11,27549,1826,5636,51794,13,34447,3900,841,4160,275,5636,22299,33670,11,951,53542,1765,3625,3091,6723,2249,45740,414,404,1208,20605,24812,13,7695,513,62163,7930,1826,54312,7930,35456,969,829,16578,5019,2515,8977,3625,21889,61244,409,1709,14081,3416,4502,4538,89672,1826,79988,1208,4647,12583,978,409,326,6,85335,665,20272,13,4418,66,272,17771,39043,326,6,32329,897,38469,13,356,17771,22842,4068,4046,12821,361,6316,77824,13,356,17771,274,6,19519,1414,665,88026,304,5259,361,5019,60946,265,3846,7930,20272,409,17317,951,20183,45632,2854,1771,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2028,8111,311,387,264,36815,315,264,31678,477,15864,389,279,8712,315,95044,11,11951,279,3229,596,11704,31474,3495,4315,279,73074,7187,304,279,76438,98440,13,578,1495,374,5439,304,8753,11,323,433,35434,279,7434,315,330,12828,1349,1,304,95044,11,1405,12074,16988,449,2254,22673,323,26612,325,5694,304,872,7446,6439,627,198,791,3229,16964,1077,1866,3217,5496,449,264,3070,304,264,2678,14458,520,459,36958,315,220,1758,11,931,20645,11,1405,1364,31408,304,18254,7640,11,9687,279,2254,4221,11,323,14454,13537,449,279,1274,13,3005,8554,430,420
