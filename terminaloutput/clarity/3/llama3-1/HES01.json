{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-11-19T13:35:57.892732596Z","response":"The transcript appears to be a recording of a conversation or presentation in French, with the speaker discussing their research on materials that can fatigue and fail due to overuse. The speaker mentions developing a new numerical tool that allows them to predict the tolerance limits and point of rupture for a new material that will be used in car doors and trunks.\n\nThe speaker explains that they are studying how the material responds when it is subjected to environmental factors such as humidity, and how it can fatigue and fail over time. They mention that the material can exhibit similar behavior to humans, becoming tired and eventually failing after reaching a certain tolerance limit.\n\nThe speaker also discusses the importance of considering not just external factors like humidity, but also internal factors like usage patterns (e.g., opening and closing doors repeatedly) which can contribute to fatigue and failure. They explain that their tool allows them to model these internal and external factors at a very small scale (micrometers), allowing for more accurate predictions about when the material is likely to fail.\n\nThe transcript appears to be a lecture or presentation on the speaker's research, with some personal anecdotes and asides thrown in.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,362,19610,45325,46939,33614,653,5634,28154,2933,7930,274,31769,1215,588,30,41621,12584,89,757,13510,653,5634,28154,2933,841,274,31769,1215,588,6502,30,507,2005,13,423,69537,541,13,34447,3846,1744,4864,5320,2249,13510,934,41901,20272,653,5634,28154,2933,37953,447,80720,93381,396,4538,20607,321,409,39674,14081,685,3869,653,3738,4545,11,3900,92215,274,6,9600,3212,22299,17317,11,3625,20183,45632,2854,1771,13,6178,72,1370,51173,11,3900,379,264,653,4545,8065,1647,20607,321,409,39674,14081,685,1826,93381,396,11,4864,36709,11,4864,296,31769,1215,588,1880,503,308,6,4683,1497,13,1252,5634,28154,2933,3900,274,6,9600,547,28463,11,3900,513,36709,1880,3900,513,5052,97717,13,34447,87320,4864,9189,1370,273,409,16968,39043,30,4366,346,1744,41091,503,57286,664,648,11,4864,52895,375,653,35462,704,321,1661,78129,7930,757,29557,409,27389,35573,514,20607,321,409,39674,14081,685,1880,514,1486,409,89869,294,22827,43453,5634,28154,2933,7930,31605,2473,514,10095,265,1880,1208,60172,951,4160,42204,409,18111,324,13,46706,514,9511,67763,39723,4864,42775,273,11,934,17771,54312,1744,4864,66517,30,622,6,15824,285,653,46110,4411,346,2933,409,3846,5634,28154,2933,1880,4864,514,66517,18434,265,7010,653,50026,40280,39723,9189,45366,9189,38831,15170,9952,15265,81645,7010,76076,21935,11,653,951,281,3946,326,6,28400,307,13109,13,4418,66,4864,296,1441,7010,326,93847,1880,1744,20272,326,93847,30,5034,4160,321,6496,7930,8175,265,11,27549,281,46651,1880,27549,281,46651,13,19421,1744,20272,514,5634,28154,2933,30,7695,31807,17194,11,3900,308,41901,25692,5636,13,393,9425,3900,93381,396,272,729,978,409,409,39674,14081,685,13,19421,8065,25646,294,22827,3738,4545,11,3900,46141,593,11,4864,91507,13510,3900,18111,97717,11,6033,96308,3900,5568,8065,9314,97717,66021,1744,39043,841,513,4160,275,6502,13,19421,272,17771,3846,1744,503,57286,664,648,1208,42723,97717,11,66021,1744,326,6,31258,1744,4864,52895,375,757,29557,2221,294,6,14283,3869,6316,4046,331,6853,25945,38920,409,326,6,541,265,409,19748,442,99746,54401,409,757,7591,68019,26725,27750,1156,10610,10308,409,84364,13,34447,9604,10333,11,3900,308,59858,264,6502,1744,39043,7010,1208,17536,11,66021,934,41901,5636,409,326,6,28400,307,13109,409,11323,266,11,9189,6033,85,23577,9189,18728,1195,15265,60172,13,41621,6033,85,23577,9189,18728,1195,15265,10095,265,13,41621,6033,85,23577,9189,18728,1195,15265,60172,13,41621,6033,85,23577,9189,18728,1195,15265,10095,265,1880,503,6,283,49606,13,14465,18728,2727,1880,503,6,283,49606,11,4864,18728,2727,1880,503,6,283,49606,11,4864,18728,2727,1880,503,6,283,49606,11,4864,18728,2727,1880,503,6,283,49606,11,4864,18728,2727,1880,503,6,283,49606,13,14465,18728,2727,13,426,1116,11,9189,326,65496,9189,514,36709,89,13,19421,39015,3625,95159,1439,1081,27462,3869,513,46131,13,19421,1208,1913,308,17771,6502,25945,78060,13,1708,1105,4068,20028,30,356,17771,39015,1744,1208,26633,90272,48901,409,1647,704,321,86953,1188,9952,3625,4046,447,811,409,1208,38094,648,64441,1880,32118,4919,2428,1744,4864,1491,19010,1082,7010,1647,1515,78493,13,14465,94297,45347,409,326,31769,331,6853,8162,2445,454,2428,3869,326,31769,331,6853,8162,2445,454,2428,54401,409,27389,35573,3869,26077,4545,3625,95159,1439,7930,3073,306,294,31109,76407,304,118904,15729,7010,653,5634,28154,2933,3567,26584,58612,486,4881,33670,934,22827,1377,373,841,513,2558,1082,13,4366,346,1744,41091,11,4864,5320,2249,1744,39043,1913,275,14707,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,791,36815,8111,311,387,264,14975,315,264,10652,477,15864,304,8753,11,449,279,19114,25394,872,3495,389,7384,430,649,36709,323,3775,4245,311,927,817,13,578,19114,34945,11469,264,502,35876,5507,430,6276,1124,311,7168,279,25065,13693,323,1486,315,89869,369,264,502,3769,430,690,387,1511,304,1841,14365,323,490,15655,627,198,791,19114,15100,430,814,527,21630,1268,279,3769,31680,994,433,374,38126,311,12434,9547,1778,439,38193,11,323,1268,433,649,36709,323,3775,927,892,13,2435,6420,430,279,3769,649,31324,4528,7865,311,12966,11,10671,19781,323,9778,22109,1306,19261,264,3738,25065,4017,627,198,791,19114,1101,35434,279,12939,315,13126,539,1120,9434,9547,1093,38193,11,719,1101,5419,9547,1093,10648,12912,320,68,13,70,2637,8736,323,15676,14365,19352,8,902,649,17210,311,36709,323,8060,13,2435,10552,430,872,5507,6276,1124,311,1646,1521,5419,323,9434,9547,520,264,1633,2678,5569,320,21914,442,2481,705,10923,369,810,13687,20492,922,994,279,3769,374,4461,311,3775,627,198,791,36815,8111,311,387,264,31678,477,15864,389,279,19114,596,3495,11,449,1063,4443,94066,323,439,3422,15338,304,13,128009],"total_duration":8294852764,"load_duration":214220,"prompt_eval_count":706,"prompt_eval_duration":1435043000,"eval_count":228,"eval_duration":6859130000}
