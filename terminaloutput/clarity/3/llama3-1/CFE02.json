The speaker describes how lignin is often burned to produce energy, but they believe it can be valuable if properly treated.\n\nThe speaker explains that they work in a laboratory where they are experimenting with treating lignin to make it more useful. They mix lignin with proteins and oxygen to increase its molecular weight, and then combine it with another waste material, corn stover, to create a new composite material that is lightweight, biodegradable, and strong.\n\nThe speaker uses a microscope to examine the new material in detail, testing its mechanical resistance and analyzing its properties. They believe that this material could be used to replace traditional plastics derived from oil, making it a more sustainable option.\n\nThroughout the transcript, the speaker's passion for their work is evident, as well as their sense of romance and idealism about the potential impact of their research on the environment.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,622,26248,547,3625,7591,331,1441,13,41621,26483,19610,39043,33288,665,27584,27138,13,57702,1208,10484,13109,282,640,483,817,409,7591,331,1441,934,54386,15783,1130,1765,20662,3197,66522,11,64972,348,2784,3625,264,3212,1744,3625,7591,74458,13,1708,1105,4502,389,864,77,1339,779,258,409,12155,7591,331,1441,13,350,21198,1131,27058,2558,556,3930,26365,1291,389,69152,3930,66304,13,356,17771,14707,4635,84,15890,389,11741,1339,1208,70002,974,11,10071,389,78422,12339,28463,8065,21765,11,220,1041,220,931,220,931,409,52021,1370,459,409,1647,7591,40213,27389,69,68862,11,1208,72700,483,26633,90272,9129,28674,3682,60224,3930,66304,13,1952,841,829,275,6502,75249,20028,13,1708,1105,389,1208,1437,30872,273,5019,2558,556,409,326,31769,64374,2523,18223,52087,13,61651,14707,11,41091,11,4864,46838,556,802,28531,479,33254,424,1208,72700,483,951,1344,8836,288,13,14465,52571,1080,30872,668,1744,1080,30872,668,3869,14448,12329,3846,7591,40213,13,46706,514,9511,67763,39723,4864,42775,273,11,4864,56445,46939,1370,2098,12267,6316,5017,978,3869,1208,72700,483,13,14465,25400,21559,951,1760,978,1572,5019,1208,9517,533,1553,8065,53052,409,27750,19670,288,294,6,61263,70,48099,13,46408,312,59976,3930,97418,951,1376,288,13,507,2005,11,829,58617,22337,978,3395,12267,19861,12826,13,9240,68,829,16458,554,8841,1640,2428,11,65285,266,409,829,19266,36235,52842,8047,9952,1208,70002,974,13,27058,1208,65827,268,404,11,4864,25400,30179,6960,653,47838,7591,40213,11679,12339,11,436,2642,273,409,7643,38672,82,11,514,72006,342,437,325,3930,16652,13,34447,4502,9189,23933,10333,3846,348,19395,10515,278,934,54386,25692,46131,9781,25108,1215,7010,1208,628,8511,409,1208,63053,5019,28130,10607,11,4864,9517,1072,285,1647,82,62005,665,281,3023,265,13,12095,39043,513,39904,22299,39043,46206,3625,348,19395,978,2629,2249,11,272,3433,10333,41091,11,7591,331,1441,5636,7591,331,1441,11,39043,2489,13,51097,26633,46684,288,15132,19227,1001,4913,36527,934,85217,1913,79738,1370,71751,4415,24918,3869,653,43453,5634,28154,2933,28814,11,6316,80444,409,88247,2428,5790,10676,978,56594,978,6902,4893,63828,1414,11,653,72006,90551,92174,13,62293,653,21438,409,51625,1854,19748,442,978,376,2428,4864,326,6,49133,7010,3625,4647,485,417,7591,41060,11,4864,514,490,9464,11,4864,326,6,44803,325,11,4864,75765,829,31807,4011,32118,4919,2428,13,362,32384,11,25692,85815,1744,2486,467,11,389,5019,969,38831,15170,3846,5634,28154,2933,7010,3625,757,392,645,409,12155,31547,1572,326,6,97802,8061,409,12155,4160,42204,11,1208,1080,593,409,12155,43116,17144,11,1370,1647,42775,1880,665,14448,285,519,951,7591,331,1441,22299,1208,72700,483,13,622,6,391,45808,39587,6316,6425,27220,8065,1323,16491,951,88247,8467,374,2425,355,3930,281,10515,5898,13,61651,97507,11,9189,23933,10333,9952,653,1437,258,409,68567,44618,28463,13,1952,25692,20028,1860,11967,514,38900,13,19421,39587,97507,11,46152,15132,19227,1001,4913,36527,1744,46152,33537,306,4415,24918,3869,653,43453,5634,28154,2933,28814,9952,653,21438,409,51625,1854,19748,442,978,376,2428,13,622,6,49133,3625,78352,409,28130,83199,38094,2428,13,51223,79,978,466,326,6,90446,13,19421,4160,321,6496,13,4418,66,497,503,34155,6033,2067,648,6316,17571,11,46838,337,8047,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,791,1495,374,264,36815,315,264,19114,7556,922,872,11939,369,34978,323,709,66,16404,12571,7384,11,11951,72700,258,11,264,555,3107,315,5684,5788,13,578,19114,16964,1268,72700,258,374,3629,27724,311,8356,4907,11,719,814,4510,433,649,387,15525,422,10489,12020,627,198,791,19114,15100,430,814,990,304,264,27692,1405,814,527,60257,449,27723,72700,258,311,1304,433,810,5505,13,2435,6651,72700,258,449,28896,323,24463,311,5376,1202,31206,4785,11,323,1243,16343,433,449,2500,12571,3769,11,14095,357,2017,11,311,1893,264,502,28814,3769,430,374,30244,11,6160,536,78130,11,323,3831,627,198,791,19114,5829,264,73757,311,21635,279,502,3769,304,7872,11,7649,1202,22936,13957,323,42118,1202,6012,13,2435,4510,430,420,3769,1436,387,1511,311,8454,8776,68386,14592,505,5707,11,3339,433,264,810,22556,3072,627,198,60105,279,36815,11,279,19114,596,11939,369,872,990,374,30576,11,439,1664,439,872,5647,315,30363,323,10728,2191,922,279,4754,5536,315,872,3495,389,279,4676,13,128009],"total_duration":7419023432,"load_duration":299157,"prompt_eval_count":660,"prompt_eval_duration":1308819000,"eval_count":204,"eval_duration":6109336000}
