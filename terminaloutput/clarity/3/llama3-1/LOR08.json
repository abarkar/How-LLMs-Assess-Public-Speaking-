The journalist is unsure what to say about the state of the forest and notes that scientists have difficulty evaluating whether it is healthy or not. They mention that the absence of degradation does not necessarily mean the forest is doing well, and that they are studying ecological indicators to evaluate the health of ecosystems.\n\nThe journalist then mentions their own research on forest ecosystems and biodiversity, and how they have been working with colleagues for 10 years to develop indicators of ecological health. They discuss how they have started a thesis project to investigate the impact of climate change on forests, using historical plant data from over 100 years ago. The results show that 11% of mountainous ecosystems have shifted towards warmer climates.\n\nThe journalist notes that other threats to forest health include soil compaction and invasive exotic species. They mention European objectives and funding for forest conservation efforts since the 1990s, but wonder if these efforts are effective in protecting the forest and its biodiversity.\n\nFinally, the journalist hints at their own research comparing protected forests with unprotected ones, with the ultimate goal of ensuring that forests remain in good health. The report ends with a metaphorical reference to touching wood, suggesting a connection between the journalist's work and the physical environment.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,3436,30854,36731,665,2167,409,9757,8511,901,2933,60630,978,76305,5019,97166,326,57286,266,409,20662,369,49530,13,1708,1105,12155,369,5615,2641,42437,22626,82133,84568,14707,13,29124,66,2182,89,11,4864,100164,409,1208,296,46651,11,951,35641,625,2439,11,951,23962,11,951,82711,31355,11,16968,39043,296,6,326,6,1334,294,6,14283,6502,21965,8811,43584,62408,8486,17194,841,829,275,6502,75249,13510,13,356,17771,4725,5019,326,52152,4811,13,11876,7330,333,8467,14848,48488,409,8811,3869,47929,4502,6316,369,49530,11412,14707,6033,6502,13,81245,11427,306,665,48901,4046,838,8977,3625,3026,2492,7930,281,12416,306,1765,27549,1880,3625,7591,70,9011,2641,1744,45602,25692,20028,1345,2852,1370,45973,11,5019,68226,13510,1744,16968,11412,14707,11,326,6,3518,768,409,7591,49241,841,8657,275,6502,13,356,17771,87320,4864,5320,2249,60946,265,4068,1208,369,49530,34501,818,5019,4046,838,8977,4538,14240,266,294,22827,1486,409,48234,91329,1640,2428,13,34447,514,80259,11,272,17771,934,54386,841,25692,6502,25400,7631,261,11,45575,4068,1744,272,17771,3846,5634,258,30,74656,6033,14707,1208,67628,11,3625,92622,66304,11,3625,9259,13,19421,5019,61512,39043,20272,220,605,8261,1744,503,6,2706,81356,14707,25400,1153,261,1208,3488,13,13789,11,4864,841,36731,39040,339,4558,325,41199,16968,3846,27138,11,10071,41199,220,605,8261,11,9952,11083,4631,4558,70,1157,11,17317,14240,664,919,3625,4046,9594,599,66474,13952,4918,1880,28130,56594,1986,13109,5019,19477,52750,951,13519,1759,409,924,33920,409,28130,14240,266,91329,1640,2428,13,1952,513,62163,11,1370,51173,11,409,74940,7479,6316,369,49530,264,63669,5019,513,52895,716,409,85722,7706,1604,6033,35597,1208,10484,13109,409,66304,10237,100243,5019,2018,8977,3869,31518,404,3625,2092,82,13,34447,3663,8065,893,593,409,390,46302,11,3900,379,264,45889,65838,11,389,274,17771,259,3514,978,5553,1208,38317,13,4418,66,11,9952,514,65827,3675,409,1647,4046,61673,11,503,34155,59062,978,6316,270,4558,325,7010,1208,88265,4864,757,17477,26633,4860,13,5034,55133,3613,68495,514,9517,6583,1386,1133,11323,266,2428,13,11876,7330,333,8467,14848,7591,1677,376,978,4538,5536,1765,3625,6136,288,11,10071,389,893,593,35597,409,100246,1765,3625,4046,9594,599,66474,13,622,34155,39587,24560,23008,9211,951,2606,4918,409,79415,5512,409,6136,288,86595,5512,1765,5636,294,22827,97739,9326,1880,4864,3625,16796,51010,28111,5512,7010,6316,25945,25626,2385,409,46681,13,622,41901,16796,7591,47348,3625,4595,409,369,5615,2641,7010,3625,447,2053,46152,84764,1188,24560,86595,5512,13,19421,503,34155,18757,48021,665,4046,28580,1744,46939,665,20605,24812,11,220,806,1034,951,4046,9594,599,66474,13952,4918,14848,4046,12821,96559,5553,951,7625,53819,5636,70412,82,934,49152,519,13,220,806,4,272,17771,653,30870,273,4550,479,46939,77554,14081,481,13,19421,1370,543,4558,1001,3869,39043,11,294,81979,3026,2492,84764,1188,24560,3608,13215,14014,41199,1317,67380,11,22299,1370,51173,514,259,13559,479,951,2092,82,6033,35597,3625,16948,4558,1634,506,354,8467,6233,1494,1056,15844,13,356,17771,87320,11,41199,3625,65838,220,1954,11,326,48968,4176,17317,21559,951,1665,22589,1880,3625,52138,729,294,6,351,404,13,11876,13952,4918,2322,73468,39587,665,2035,951,6299,1765,514,25911,5019,1760,978,1414,1208,369,49530,1880,829,56594,1986,13109,13,34447,1913,54960,11,1826,54312,1744,39043,15572,68,39043,30,356,17771,1208,26633,90272,3488,1744,4864,757,17477,13,9589,54312,1744,3625,3435,8467,78511,14295,665,282,525,324,409,1208,17332,11159,13109,15132,31914,2492,30,9589,54312,1744,12155,9045,15132,8657,285,1821,30,27058,39043,4864,91507,93455,3625,369,5615,2641,7930,15132,1760,19395,14014,9952,19637,645,7930,514,15132,1069,21719,11,66021,1744,11,8065,1620,11,29449,1665,333,308,17771,6502,71357,409,47929,4068,82133,3625,369,5615,2641,13,19421,39043,11,39043,308,17771,934,31109,14240,2070,13,5034,1620,13109,11,272,17771,934,6,37907,779,1188,665,7970,14240,266,13,14465,15119,1557,3930,66304,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2028,374,264,36815,315,264,23672,596,1934,505,9757,8511,901,2933,13952,304,9822,13,578,23672,374,44003,1148,311,2019,922,279,1614,315,279,13952,323,8554,430,14248,617,17250,38663,3508,433,374,9498,477,539,13,2435,6420,430,279,19821,315,53568,1587,539,14647,3152,279,13952,374,3815,1664,11,323,430,814,527,21630,50953,34824,311,15806,279,2890,315,61951,627,198,791,23672,1243,34945,872,1866,3495,389,13952,61951,323,73119,11,323,1268,814,617,1027,3318,449,18105,369,220,605,1667,311,2274,34824,315,50953,2890,13,2435,4358,1268,814,617,3940,264,17850,2447,311,19874,279,5536,315,10182,2349,389,36658,11,1701,13970,6136,828,505,927,220,1041,1667,4227,13,578,3135,1501,430,220,806,4,315,16700,788,61951,617,30073,7119,46039,92399,627,198,791,23672,8554,430,1023,18208,311,13952,2890,2997,17614,1391,1335,323,53354,39418,9606,13,2435,6420,7665,26470,323,11006,369,13952,29711,9045,2533,279,220,777,1954,82,11,719,5895,422,1521,9045,527,7524,304,22973,279,13952,323,1202,7
