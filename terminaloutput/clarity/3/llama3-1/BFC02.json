The economist explains that they conducted a study to investigate whether people are more likely to respond positively to rental property advertisements featuring certain names or characteristics.\n\nThe study involved sending out thousands of emails to people with different names, including Émilie, Vincent, and Mohamed, and analyzing the response rates. The results showed that Mohamed had significantly lower response rates than Vincent and Émilie, even when controlling for other factors such as job stability and income level.\n\nThe economist attributes this difference to implicit biases and stereotypes associated with the name Mohamed, which can lead people to perceive him as less stable or having a lower income. This is not necessarily due to racism or sexism, but rather due to unconscious associations that can influence our behavior.\n\nThe study highlights the importance of considering these biases when designing policies to combat discrimination in housing. The economist plans to present their findings to policymakers and hopes that they will be able to act on the results to promote greater equality and fairness in the rental market.\n\nOverall, this conversation sheds light on the complex issue of discrimination in housing and the need for data-driven approaches to address it.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,6433,981,2439,1744,9189,779,9188,89,21744,978,71237,294,22827,74756,1133,1880,1744,9189,46838,62316,89,514,29740,261,13,27058,3846,20028,11,9189,39904,89,6316,38920,46320,1765,7757,11,1370,51173,1765,2009,6098,7307,13,33150,25646,409,45889,49301,11,9189,2215,19610,56321,86658,11,56321,7631,288,25945,92892,17724,7930,841,3722,4558,8135,1744,1370,514,550,98078,951,23496,355,13,29124,73370,648,11,35407,1880,60759,26483,688,26725,3625,56321,15265,74756,1133,3869,28130,733,60768,13,41621,308,6,52659,934,22827,74206,74756,1133,11,3900,9189,47090,39587,90194,9465,27750,56321,23496,355,13,4418,66,4864,9189,17477,1208,3488,11,7930,73661,62316,89,45325,949,29124,73370,648,949,35407,949,60759,949,41621,2665,9667,53070,8065,706,569,949,2998,59157,13109,11,3625,56321,86658,1744,9189,47592,312,3209,355,15132,51527,13,81245,14848,24560,60630,5512,1370,653,52571,324,13,24703,52571,324,55729,648,409,9189,8678,805,1880,409,7591,23827,261,4502,9189,27389,59958,23577,653,3738,955,294,6,485,65023,84,13,19421,3846,52571,324,11,36346,14707,272,17771,41091,13,61651,97507,11,2761,65220,1647,4046,73085,11,9952,653,1515,78493,390,79884,5019,11,653,409,11083,39904,12,67380,4799,285,1826,294,6,3239,42219,951,2606,4918,409,86658,961,412,665,9822,5019,7591,23827,261,4502,20719,81235,3625,86658,1913,285,29124,73370,648,11,35407,6033,60759,14848,951,17393,96642,294,6,677,2002,404,6316,90509,1880,39587,653,1515,1133,13,3206,719,949,41621,326,26248,554,89,25692,85815,13550,285,11,272,17771,294,57286,664,1291,1208,21934,13,19421,5019,61512,11,4864,841,36731,6502,15983,77828,11,4864,841,36731,6502,8841,77828,11,2536,11,41091,4864,36731,82653,17194,13,34447,326,31769,45317,648,11,9189,514,3665,89,25945,14707,11,3846,308,17771,6502,1744,1208,17452,11,1208,60028,11,1208,1589,1082,11,63401,11,16968,39043,11,16968,39043,13,11842,13,445,31769,45317,648,274,55624,978,22550,28463,3869,1208,3488,951,14572,12922,1841,3900,308,17771,6502,31914,580,82653,81235,1744,951,23496,355,779,1188,50419,5512,11,1913,79738,1370,23761,1515,5512,3869,1208,84411,764,35285,409,1208,39973,1880,264,1188,5636,409,5107,5512,3869,513,98054,1765,28130,39381,409,42775,13,62293,3846,955,294,57286,799,39587,11,389,264,44351,18757,513,98054,42463,1744,60759,11,70374,3869,5353,409,4538,550,98078,11,50590,26633,37291,40970,409,17393,294,6,677,2002,404,6316,90509,1744,35407,13,69327,35597,11,1744,29124,73370,648,43989,1208,5636,71151,73661,648,1370,8318,27750,56321,23496,355,13,34447,294,94572,15273,2605,1188,20662,44178,16271,409,89714,949,2998,67781,11,5019,8678,805,11,5019,945,404,11,5019,3698,1617,265,1208,21934,11,3900,1826,100243,294,41901,74282,66014,3625,11384,13,12095,9189,35881,579,89,409,90194,29124,73370,648,1370,51173,11,1826,54312,1744,45602,76605,13510,1744,9189,62299,1877,17194,3869,326,6,19395,569,409,35407,6033,9148,17194,3869,326,6,19395,569,409,60759,949,61651,14707,2536,11,6502,52842,42625,13,41621,45366,25945,14707,35881,1814,409,90194,29124,73370,648,1841,9189,77554,978,23577,1744,3625,56127,15132,5636,28677,288,409,2389,5397,1744,3625,7515,3209,2439,13,19421,389,841,25692,6502,60019,9189,71751,16831,13,4418,66,41091,11,10878,519,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,51441,14091,511,1291,3625,4865,39723,653,23496,84,1826,2665,13532,5019,951,6503,2439,1515,8467,9952,3625,4865,39723,3900,1826,2665,13532,5019,951,6503,2439,3900,848,8467,11,1370,27052,68,6033,1877,44618,1370,51173,13,19421,5019,3846,20028,11,1880,665,5636,294,6,3239,42219,951,2606,4918,409,86658,961,412,665,9822,11,4864,59157,1082,6316,32118,2629,19415,5893,325,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,6316,80444,409,1239,896,1133,409,40744,3625,14240,29246,86595,14014,7010,514,38900,1765,514,27584,70927,5019,665,20028,6316,86806,1880,27584,14240,799,13,622,34155,44351,1046,12416,3869,6316,2385,409,46681,409,5636,409,220,3965,220,931,384,61320,11,3846,7930,757,29557,409,44178,63934,1291,3625,9637,2249,409,90509,665,34501,3930,53052,294,6,26125,3116,7907,7010,514,8232,13,445,1105,593,20662,37291,11,4864,91507,68226,20028,951,14240,29246,1765,514,27584,70927,11,4864,91507,68226,20028,951,14240,29246,1765,514,27584,70927,13,445,1105,593,20662,37291,11,60759,1120,57609,6316,6671,15528,11,22299,1370,51173,514,20272,294,93825,34501,29583,11,1208,21934,1826,4272,79507,5636,2267,1260,13,24703,7930,1280,2428,934,35329,308,59858,264,6502,1744,514,27052,68,7930,28068,68,13,7695,379,264,28463,514,20272,1744,409,2385,11,3625,23496,355,23423,306,1744,514,550,98078,60759,1826,4189,978,3869,6316,5636,2267,1260,28062,3748,978,11,653,5636,2267,1260,19443,84,1880,39587,3869,653,5636,25500,10025,593,13,29179,321,6496,11,9189,665,3665,89,48488,5636,1765,1208,21934,7010,514,1515,1133,13,14465,296,41901,91507,1647,95920,11083,100246,10253,3435,8467,78511,14295,13,5250,332,85815,5019,9598,12,8839,945,404,11,10071,503,34155,22299,653,1131,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2028,374,264,36815,315,264,10652,1990,459,46215,323,4423,889,374,817
