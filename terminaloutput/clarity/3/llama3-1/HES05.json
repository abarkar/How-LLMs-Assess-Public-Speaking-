The speaker argues that humans are capable of predicting the future through projection, and that this ability is used every day in decision-making.\n\nThe speaker also mentions their thesis work on planning in uncertain environments, using a supercomputer (the human brain) and three mechanisms: habituation, economy of intellectual energy, and dynamic planning. They illustrate these concepts with examples from daily life, such as using a phone to call someone or planning a route.\n\nThe text also mentions the Mars rover Opportunity, which was used as an example of a robot that can only plan in a deterministic environment. The speaker's goal is to go beyond this limitation and develop more advanced planning capabilities for uncertain environments.\n\nWould you like me to help with anything specific related to this transcript, such as translation, summarization, or analysis?","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,622,82405,404,2727,1744,17317,74533,26725,2107,4893,409,550,15433,556,326,6,5389,404,13,3489,6870,949,41621,841,757,272,3433,10333,6502,949,14465,91507,9189,514,7591,1677,95920,13,12095,4864,35456,82,1647,100007,11,22299,272,76832,11,1880,1744,503,6,283,49606,1208,1925,11,1744,11412,2442,57375,513,45347,949,4275,98676,519,6502,4499,261,11,1647,100007,11412,10390,655,1370,88026,1880,25692,85815,513,272,34858,13,41621,23933,10333,11,9189,62299,26725,2107,4893,409,27389,35573,3625,1615,978,45045,294,31109,1957,7930,841,274,17771,6502,35597,86595,8047,13,356,17771,3846,934,54386,917,6853,1208,22343,13,19421,17317,4186,19941,20662,23878,13109,26725,3625,49301,11,665,54008,1291,5019,59394,951,35881,6948,13,4366,51173,11,4502,4864,5320,2249,917,8023,1647,2167,12844,409,270,4558,325,11,1744,503,53149,6853,14707,4046,1325,336,479,26725,3625,49301,11,1744,51441,12,3841,20028,949,7695,47090,1744,4864,864,77,818,1647,100007,11,1744,4864,514,7591,424,583,4618,11,1744,503,6,52009,7010,514,9517,79,62704,11,1744,4864,52571,4538,99077,7010,1208,34024,11,5019,665,5589,326,53149,8023,13,19421,5019,46777,14240,2070,11,503,6,27153,361,6316,22343,13,24703,1744,17317,11457,2439,409,20028,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,409,46524,6316,22343,11,6316,16578,294,6,4109,5019,93381,71933,653,1665,333,11,274,53149,6853,1208,3197,2461,11,1880,1826,514,270,25253,12717,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,22425,81235,11,1208,3197,2461,1826,653,951,8106,288,28405,1045,1759,409,326,55624,8677,1989,1104,72,6853,13,46408,264,14175,285,409,75831,951,29807,22299,66090,63484,13,27058,66056,7930,841,514,74282,79738,6502,11,4160,3457,48379,13,24703,12585,3154,263,638,11,7591,981,978,1765,21725,665,220,1049,19,11,264,24560,7591,6595,978,3900,379,264,45889,5347,33903,11,42138,220,868,65838,409,82134,1880,781,7911,2249,3600,11,1880,220,868,65838,409,3197,2461,13,356,13059,519,11,5019,1744,829,3197,2461,34501,818,11,3900,47090,934,35329,513,2503,361,7010,653,50026,40280,4684,4558,79507,7591,23827,978,11,1880,39723,3900,308,59858,264,6502,294,81979,6299,1744,3625,4502,15564,13,9648,519,13510,1744,274,35329,50590,14425,69068,653,49295,3675,11,45602,44521,1339,24560,4684,76366,13,3206,42775,409,270,4558,325,1826,294,6,14283,5636,78060,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,409,58673,15610,7010,653,50026,40280,18003,2428,1880,304,5259,84,13,27058,45602,11,503,49963,1082,653,2307,12,8904,324,1744,9189,4635,2852,53070,26725,11,514,272,5976,2933,2854,467,13,19421,665,54008,1291,11,56321,32118,4919,2191,288,13,2009,272,5976,2933,2854,467,1826,653,72601,409,10758,11,7930,1826,653,72601,409,10758,7930,1826,25945,3062,13,2009,21134,11,272,17771,1208,5457,409,326,6,10796,3993,13,445,1105,593,4864,7591,424,583,4618,1647,4046,73085,409,100007,11,503,6,27153,361,665,20272,653,40126,409,54409,12760,69125,11,1744,4864,66517,409,85722,5636,6033,40970,3154,263,638,11,66021,1744,4864,3625,16796,2267,1220,19227,1001,409,37291,1744,4864,3625,16796,917,6091,13,2009,26633,90272,11,272,17771,326,31769,45317,648,294,31769,64374,17108,31037,13,622,6,4202,2852,18757,46524,653,49348,3197,5019,917,8023,1647,2167,12844,409,270,4558,325,11,1370,51173,11,665,2322,61512,4538,99077,665,4799,72,11,6033,14707,665,312,45019,4538,99077,11,10071,11,22299,48488,409,47104,11,4864,35456,82,1208,6425,1208,5636,8795,2852,5048,13,2009,8348,13532,25253,11,272,17771,1208,3197,2461,18003,2428,13,2009,38900,1826,665,738,5048,51913,3294,11,1880,4046,12821,361,15878,272,24201,13,16770,9165,729,11,1120,1133,11,1647,2167,12844,409,270,4558,325,757,61158,6853,13,14465,91507,2961,5615,466,7643,3197,2461,1880,296,6,1138,5615,466,39015,13,25145,72,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5084,1093,499,617,264,36815,315,264,8753,1495,922,52997,279,3938,11,9293,11,323,21075,11478,13,578,19114,29633,430,12966,527,13171,315,52997,279,3938,1555,22343,11,323,430,420,5845,374,1511,1475,1938,304,5597,28846,627,198,791,19114,1101,34945,872,17850,990,389,9293,304,36218,22484,11,1701,264,2307,44211,320,1820,3823,8271,8,323,2380,24717,25,14464,4090,11,8752,315,20207,4907,11,323,8915,9293,13,2435,41468,1521,19476,449,10507,505,7446,2324,11,1778,439,1701,264,4641,311,1650,4423,477,9293,264,6149,627,198,791,1495,1101,34945,279,21725,62352,48379,11,902,574,1511,439,459,3187,315,264,12585,430,649,1193,3197,304,264,73449,4676,13,578,19114,596,5915,374,311,733,7953,420,20893,323,2274,810,11084,9293,17357,369,36218,22484,627,198,29089,499,1093,757,311,1520,449,4205,3230,5552,311,420,36815,11,1778,439,14807,11,29385,2065,11,477,6492,30,128009],"total_duration":6884019577,"load_duration":250017,"prompt_eval_count":758,"prompt_eval_duration":1445617000,"eval_count":181,"eval_duration":5437713000}
