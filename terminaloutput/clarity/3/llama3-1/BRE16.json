The speaker is discussing their project, which aims to develop an ideal thermal insulator for buildings that is eco-friendly and performs well.\n\nThe speaker starts by mentioning that they spend half of their days working in the mud to create small pâtés (presumably some kind of mixture or blend) and then measuring them with precision. They explain that their research consists of characterizing a thermal insulation material that is ideal for buildings, which must be ecological and performant.\n\nThe speaker highlights that this material can be produced almost anywhere on Earth using only three ingredients, which are locally available. It produces no waste, stores a lot of carbon, and can be recycled endlessly. They also mention that they are studying the composition of the material, including the clays (argiles) found in different scales.\n\nThe speaker then introduces the second ingredient: hemp (chanvre). They explain that hemp has been used to make ropes for large ships and that its fibers have a cousin that is illegally smoked (presumably marijuana or cannabis). The speaker notes that at the core of the hemp stem, there are small particles that resemble wood and are very lightweight due to their porosity. These particles provide the insulating power.\n\nThe speaker mentions that they study the size of these particles and their ability to absorb water. When combined with the third ingredient, water, they create a \"lightened earth\" (terre allégée).\n\nTo study the performance of this material without making millions of blends, the speaker decided to make a bet (pari) and go on a journey across Brittany and Normandy to collect 30 soils that they would then expose at the surface according to a precise protocol. They then repeated the process in a laboratory setting to express exactly why their small pâté held or not.\n\nThe speaker highlights that by choosing terres (soils) with different behaviors, they were able to select 5 representative soils from the entire West and 3 hemp varieties representing all of France. They then mixed these soils and studied their performances, finding that they had excellent mechanical properties, top-notch insulation power, and exceptional humidity management.\n\nTo ensure the use of their research, the speaker's project is being developed within the framework of participatory research, which includes artisans (presumably craftsmen or builders). Finally, the speaker mentions that they are currently working on developing a simple on-site test that will allow them to determine which materials and in what quantities can be used to guarantee these performances.\n\nThe transcript ends with the speaker highlighting that the diversity of natural materials is a powerful tool for building the future.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,9424,1055,10333,45325,11,60404,11,3625,86696,281,64272,5512,3869,1208,86451,949,61651,14707,41091,11,503,41901,16796,20272,1647,42775,13,14465,39904,1208,4647,12583,978,409,11083,503,3514,14014,11,3625,69236,7010,1208,30870,68,11,3869,20028,951,86696,281,64272,5512,13,19421,4864,3625,84921,9952,51625,1854,13,36684,58673,2249,409,38317,13263,3869,57705,978,6091,261,653,13399,519,30945,2428,887,63497,5019,514,293,64272,3904,13,7695,42182,23761,514,5636,91329,1640,2428,1880,514,5636,2804,519,3284,13,1952,25692,514,9765,462,16339,1685,593,961,412,1765,10335,265,11,9952,71686,56321,81336,15433,4167,11,1744,326,54386,46524,64,44093,1353,54960,13,7695,841,54206,85624,7591,40213,11,3900,5708,68,48488,409,1841,20337,11,1880,665,5636,11,389,25692,514,1421,10993,3869,326,52152,5589,72,13,356,17771,3709,3433,481,758,27058,47929,3846,1744,272,17771,11,28068,2439,3869,1208,3488,5019,653,7643,53510,13,7777,11,21134,81336,15433,1188,13,7054,758,3489,301,5634,28154,2933,409,8246,44260,496,1604,11,57485,3869,1208,37291,7010,1208,8309,52009,409,921,483,1880,7010,514,523,69628,2933,409,650,92512,14081,569,11,1826,264,4972,72,4382,11,10071,25945,6485,68,11,1841,25945,3977,949,507,2005,11,1208,88026,1589,361,13,46706,11083,58673,2249,11,4864,326,57286,664,648,3869,96642,4046,331,37907,5019,665,7591,23827,261,15907,40321,1821,11,81186,3625,1417,3742,13,3459,37854,14480,7138,66601,13,7777,11,26633,90272,81336,15433,1188,13,7054,758,3489,6853,628,5048,11,15890,3625,16178,417,14848,55505,3869,1208,59251,951,23125,1154,951,5636,94527,293,349,12249,11,264,653,36271,7930,513,282,3972,5986,978,43310,949,507,2005,11,97507,11,514,27114,49606,13,362,326,55624,57663,409,1208,259,7404,11,389,71451,409,98385,2598,2482,594,28111,519,8065,66304,11,25945,73083,31539,11,1841,7245,1572,409,4247,437,13109,13,356,17771,84568,7930,1469,90332,546,514,68226,13399,519,13,2009,490,1791,11,272,17771,934,35329,379,264,8065,40970,3154,519,409,27114,49606,1744,409,35641,13,1708,1105,11,5019,3625,44178,63934,1291,11,503,57286,664,648,1208,62827,951,2598,2482,1880,28130,23878,13109,3869,15938,655,409,326,93847,13,44031,5317,978,3869,29449,8348,13532,25253,81336,15433,1188,11,326,93847,11,17317,64290,2439,3846,934,54386,917,6853,6316,88026,682,19395,8047,13,43987,26178,11,4068,14240,664,1291,3625,24601,409,20662,88026,682,19395,8047,15878,20028,951,2606,81560,409,32118,5317,288,11,10071,665,864,52985,665,42463,20662,9765,1130,817,21797,13109,949,61651,14707,11,41091,7930,86807,100196,11,503,34155,20272,653,68082,13,622,34155,52579,11083,11176,288,1880,7643,281,6853,11,1880,4864,36731,79988,3869,30517,43905,1208,72777,24812,1880,1208,20935,438,648,11,2536,6502,5019,3625,9517,41546,321,1291,11,10071,5019,9517,2119,466,220,966,2024,417,1744,503,34155,87885,2353,14014,8065,2092,11,65735,653,1760,511,1286,51625,285,5019,665,7591,23827,261,28130,52962,1133,11,665,34501,409,28130,259,1994,324,665,384,2933,13,14465,757,38831,83384,35597,9952,951,86696,281,64272,5512,13,34447,1208,44178,16271,9952,41091,11,16968,46110,11,272,17771,1744,503,34155,20272,951,4043,2852,665,9511,67763,5019,15522,3212,4839,1133,87320,1647,46110,281,64272,978,259,1188,6033,6502,13,41757,412,978,10253,46681,951,2027,38647,409,27114,49606,11,503,34155,45575,409,75249,90194,951,2024,417,1880,951,27114,85,417,10253,52962,3808,25945,85114,13,19421,39015,11,69428,758,14465,757,38831,83384,9952,220,20,2024,417,91678,5983,409,16968,326,88766,3121,1880,220,18,27114,85,417,91678,5983,409,43905,1208,9822,13,62293,11083,2024,417,1880,11083,27114,85,417,73661,552,11,4864,59157,1082,951,32118,5317,288,11,44829,503,57286,664,648,43153,24601,13,39783,5899,361,32118,4919,2428,89646,11,653,68226,13399,519,8065,1948,11,1880,6316,23878,13109,3869,342,52424,326,6,28400,307,13109,4046,4791,5392,5048,13,27058,1089,7889,326,6,18168,409,11083,58673,2249,11,1647,46494,274,6,27153,361,7010,514,60697,409,88817,8696,5293,5983,13,7695,18916,332,81186,951,100130,13,1708,1105,5019,1913,404,11,10362,1082,1765,514,88026,2933,11,4864,42775,273,1180,77776,3869,52895,716,653,4382,1296,409,44453,1291,7930,29557,2221,409,7591,23827,261,934,2053,86374,4298,2249,1880,665,74940,10484,13109,23761,42587,5512,5019,40192,404,27750,24601,13,5034,88026,1589,361,1880,3625,16178,417,348,19395,978,2629,645,15132,951,86374,4298,2249,42587,5512,41199,1208,85434,951,27138,13,34447,3625,14240,664,1291,17317,68061,625,306,6316,14896,13,5034,21797,13109,1826,653,54829,704,321,5019,19477,52750,326,6,5389,404,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5084,1093,499,617,264,36815,315,264,15864,477,264,31678,922,3495,389,22556,4857,7384,13,578,19114,374,25394,872,2447,11,902,22262,311,2274,459,10728,29487,1672,10733,369,14016,430,374,42688,22658,323,27772,1664,627,198,791,19114,8638,555,45391,430,814,8493,4376,315,872,2919,3318,304,279,27275,311,1893,2678,281,64272,5512,320,24544,76051,1063,3169,315,21655,477,20955,8,323,1243,30090,1124,449,164
