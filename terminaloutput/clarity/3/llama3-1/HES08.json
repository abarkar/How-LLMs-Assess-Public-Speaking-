It appears to be a presentation on machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) by a researcher. Here's a breakdown of the text:\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe speaker starts by showing an image of a tiger on the screen, followed by several more images of tigers, with bears in the top-right corner. He explains that this is an example of machine learning, where the audience can learn to distinguish between tigers and bears through examples.\n\n**Motivation for research**\n\nThe researcher shares his motivation for exploring AI: he wants to develop a system that can learn from very few examples or even no examples at all (shot learning). This would enable AI to recognize objects it has never seen before, which is crucial in many applications such as medical image analysis, autonomous vehicle design, and voice recognition.\n\n**Current limitations**\n\nThe speaker highlights the current limitations of machine learning: a system needs millions of examples to learn effectively, which can be time-consuming and costly to collect. He suggests that this approach might not be efficient enough, especially when working with limited data sets.\n\n**Goal: zero-shot learning**\n\nThe researcher's goal is to develop AI models that can learn from zero or very few examples, leveraging relationships between images and text descriptions to recognize objects it has never seen before. This would enable applications such as diagnosing rare diseases or identifying new proteins.\n\n**Research approach**\n\nTo achieve this goal, the speaker outlines his research approach: he applies tensor products with non-linearities and maximizes a bilinear compatibility function between the resulting matrix and semantic vectors. In essence, he uses a lot of math!\n\n**Experimental results**\n\nThe researcher presents experimental results from training his model to identify bird species based on images and text descriptions. He then tested his model by categorizing photos of 50 new bird species that it had never seen before, with only textual descriptions available. The model successfully identified the species in most cases.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe speaker concludes by thanking the audience for their attention and hopes that his research will contribute to simplifying AI applications when working with limited data sets.\n\nOverall, this transcript highlights the exciting possibilities of machine learning and AI, as well as the researcher's passion for pushing the boundaries of what is currently possible.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,8242,326,31769,73085,11,665,62321,3869,96721,11,9189,45366,46131,653,259,343,265,13,2998,21273,788,11,653,259,343,265,13,2998,21273,788,11,653,259,343,265,13,2998,21273,788,11,653,259,343,265,13,20935,54960,11,4864,3567,41098,2018,8977,22299,39043,45889,2606,4918,409,37291,11,10071,4864,308,34155,1744,220,5245,2132,288,11,39587,4864,91507,671,43711,1414,653,28800,13,2998,62321,3869,7118,635,11,653,11604,13,2998,21273,788,11,653,11604,13,2998,21273,788,11,653,11604,11,5099,13,33150,83259,11,665,62321,11,3900,379,264,6316,48659,2217,13,42215,1370,8318,9189,73953,934,35329,274,6,74972,294,22827,11604,949,1183,12416,14707,13,42215,5019,653,259,343,265,949,4366,64965,13,622,34155,6316,51651,48659,5019,1208,3682,13109,294,6,40997,9189,11,3869,961,514,1647,82,62005,49733,13,41621,308,6,90276,6502,35597,4684,4558,79507,7591,6519,978,1370,326,6,5987,11,326,55624,8677,1989,1104,72,6853,13,24703,1744,9189,75090,409,20028,274,53149,6853,7010,514,96839,51307,2428,3930,5780,6975,11,6033,46430,1056,425,61852,2428,13,41621,47592,917,6091,3869,2515,8977,6316,259,9011,1557,11,49733,1612,287,8977,653,11604,294,22827,259,343,265,11,3869,31632,294,58736,3342,645,13,3206,42775,6824,68,3869,20028,20028,1208,27584,14896,3869,951,6141,3357,1759,13,11876,8522,409,326,53149,8135,1056,425,61852,2428,15132,6301,316,1347,4893,13,38527,325,294,6,3726,35030,3074,645,11,43656,409,45165,83613,2482,95103,288,11,10071,28463,88605,12253,1604,11,4790,2720,61852,2428,13,1952,92215,45347,1208,57992,8047,3869,3625,1160,261,13,27058,61512,11,3846,955,294,6,16082,1557,264,653,80259,13,65381,326,6,75876,1180,31037,11,5019,917,9484,265,31914,6480,11,653,6141,3357,324,264,63669,409,2606,4918,294,58736,3342,645,7930,15132,1317,82,1880,71151,1080,30872,668,2249,3869,6667,261,13,27058,14687,10539,20028,64972,949,362,4972,72,11,97507,13,386,23034,4502,9189,308,49152,74466,56316,33614,13080,11604,13080,259,343,265,11,9189,5019,7379,89,78705,55755,917,9484,265,3869,31632,409,27750,45889,94320,645,13,27058,14687,10539,20028,35597,64972,949,5250,332,85815,934,6,88423,951,94320,645,14707,2665,9667,11,6316,86806,2217,1370,8415,97193,8657,404,1339,13,27058,14687,10539,20028,35597,11,35597,64972,949,5250,332,10539,16456,3458,66014,79071,14896,949,5250,332,10539,16456,3458,66014,79071,14896,1744,326,54386,308,26248,56316,33614,949,4366,51173,11,5019,7379,89,45325,16456,3458,66014,514,2886,84,12704,32973,1370,8318,3625,56321,5448,3930,3122,949,46706,326,6,12828,978,8747,266,11,2536,13,34447,4502,4864,9189,21559,326,6,26125,934,22827,2886,84,12704,32973,11,272,17771,22299,653,259,343,265,11,10071,272,17771,12704,84,11,39043,3567,1188,16968,409,16578,48488,5636,51794,13,445,6,1735,333,409,11083,88817,8696,1826,294,55624,978,911,261,20662,23878,13109,3869,6316,11478,1989,1104,72,6853,13,12623,71269,333,81235,11,4864,1491,19010,1082,3625,4398,3073,15844,9465,951,5448,1880,951,28887,1495,65832,54401,1744,20662,44190,44829,325,16456,3458,66014,951,2909,1441,934,80720,308,26248,35597,56316,348,355,13,356,17771,3846,934,54386,917,6853,3930,1167,56771,12,978,70329,2428,13,356,17771,514,3937,12769,6689,6975,65801,409,326,53149,8135,1056,425,9952,1167,56771,51173,13,12535,39043,15572,68,949,356,17771,4382,11,503,6,77196,2428,10253,5448,6316,47528,409,54021,16000,72,2053,1218,2827,13649,5512,409,2536,2922,258,978,277,35933,11,1880,4864,31127,1082,6316,34501,409,12413,40948,978,106407,978,12267,9465,1208,5634,23994,65285,5048,1880,3625,56735,38647,274,17060,519,8467,13,2998,25500,11,503,49963,1082,6502,8811,409,71808,13,34447,1826,54312,1744,39043,15572,68,949,27058,514,47929,11,503,34155,294,6,370,541,83786,25108,52235,1647,83597,3869,13110,326,6,25632,4558,346,294,22827,297,1082,2933,3869,31632,294,6,3726,1880,409,1495,288,13,14465,25400,16796,76826,7631,978,409,8415,94829,12329,951,7397,294,6,69289,12249,917,23992,519,3869,220,1135,80080,16948,4558,1634,11,15890,3900,308,26248,56316,33614,653,74206,71269,27236,11,1880,1765,3625,447,37907,3625,513,2482,44827,70720,97958,951,28887,1495,65832,13,3206,83597,264,18757,13110,4495,1133,326,6,25632,4558,346,7010,1208,3682,13109,951,4865,13,362,98020,11,503,6,25632,12339,1744,27750,58673,2249,6044,8977,546,3869,15858,3125,326,100017,409,326,55624,8677,1989,1104,72,6853,87158,6502,6033,28800,409,46681,15132,70720,11,5019,1370,51173,1891,8372,72684,951,8811,17491,436,5518,11,13110,409,80080,1760,978,1572,11,6033,14707,97717,16456,3458,66014,951,25500,12704,332,285,13,14465,9189,312,1195,25134,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,32,27387,36815,0,1102,8111,311,387,264,15864,389,5780,6975,323,21075,11478,320,15836,8,555,264,32185,13,5810,596,264,31085,315,279,1495,1473,9,9,38255,334,198,198,791,19114,8638,555,9204,459,2217,315,264,52835,389,279,4264,11,8272,555,3892,810,5448,315,259,33214,11,449,30824,304,279,1948,6840,9309,13,1283,15100,430,420,374,459,3187,315,5780,6975,11,1405,279,10877,649,4048,311,33137,1990,259,33214,323
