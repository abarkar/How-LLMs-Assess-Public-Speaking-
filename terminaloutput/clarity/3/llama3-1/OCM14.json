{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-11-19T13:28:18.969741654Z","response":"This appears to be a transcript of a speech or lecture given by the author on the topic of radicalization and its relation to terrorism. The speaker argues that the concept of radicalization is problematic because it lacks structure, scientific or juridical definition, and fails to provide clarity on what exactly constitutes radicalization.\n\nThe speaker also criticizes the notion of radicalization for being accusatory and moralistic, which can lead to misinterpretation and misunderstanding. They suggest that instead of using vague terms like \"radicalization,\" we should use more precise language like \"violent activism\" or \"isolationist group.\"\n\nThe speaker also touches on the issue of how governments have responded to radicalization, citing France's plans to combat it as an example. They argue that these plans lack functionality and effectiveness due to the ambiguous nature of the concept.\n\nThroughout the speech, the author seems to be advocating for a more nuanced and scientifically-grounded approach to understanding and combating radicalization. They also emphasize the importance of respecting people's legal rights and freedoms, rather than using moral or emotional appeals to combat radicalization.\n\nSome key points made by the speaker include:\n\n* The concept of radicalization lacks structure and definition\n* Radicalization is accusatory and moralistic, leading to misinterpretation and misunderstanding\n* It is important to distinguish between moral and legal issues\n* Using precise language like \"violent activism\" or \"isolationist group\" can be more effective than using vague terms like \"radicalization\"\n* Governments' plans to combat radicalization are often ineffective due to the ambiguous nature of the concept\n\nThe speaker concludes by quoting Albert Camus, suggesting that naming things correctly is important for avoiding harm and promoting security.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,25048,11,80693,417,1880,12366,13,19881,285,26886,645,11,56321,94320,645,409,26886,645,1448,680,14014,294,39346,1370,951,52309,1900,20320,288,53532,3869,3846,934,54386,917,6853,1208,18336,8082,13,1708,1105,3663,3869,20662,81695,11,3625,17258,3415,17260,586,82,665,9822,14848,5906,665,2035,951,6787,409,63922,668,45973,1208,18336,8082,10071,7930,13509,54960,893,17187,409,34501,43078,13109,13,27058,62998,949,356,17771,326,22827,951,13878,1744,4864,9781,635,7010,7643,270,4558,325,1880,1744,17317,682,2439,46131,40126,13,445,6,1735,333,409,20662,270,4558,325,272,17771,409,68226,2579,263,1215,34501,43078,13109,1880,31914,582,13109,3869,27750,6787,13,1708,1105,934,17771,54312,7930,841,11412,6502,9952,1208,23035,409,18336,8082,44829,593,272,17771,27549,7930,1826,665,5353,949,423,6,370,541,11,27549,308,26248,6502,409,6070,11,13080,16422,307,2428,11,13080,7330,52760,13,4366,51173,11,7010,514,60697,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,757,36731,92759,978,8065,3197,5426,409,27389,7611,409,1208,18336,8082,78511,978,665,220,679,23,1370,514,85182,40280,13,19421,3869,220,7261,312,26500,11,389,25692,379,46131,514,3937,18336,8082,10071,6502,6316,86806,37291,3846,1744,39043,76605,13510,13,432,5512,495,266,11,9189,62299,48647,294,6,2295,652,978,466,20662,23035,22299,7970,9189,97487,13,29179,321,6496,13,64105,64,272,17771,514,21134,1486,13,1611,2249,72,111908,1133,11,1208,23035,409,18336,8082,11,27549,841,5965,57609,6502,13,46408,834,1788,57609,13,46408,62742,13,19421,665,66517,519,45602,11,27549,26514,2182,44093,5636,409,63683,11,44093,5636,294,6,17060,6082,11,44093,5636,409,37392,11,44093,5636,409,37392,65268,13,34447,56316,5636,11,1880,272,17771,39015,514,10045,1744,503,34155,293,19395,352,978,10071,514,10045,1826,3062,66090,2922,6496,11,272,17771,56316,5636,409,6225,13,64105,64,272,17771,514,26633,90272,1486,13,19421,514,8348,13532,25253,1486,272,17771,1744,1131,5034,23035,409,18336,8082,11,27549,1612,287,361,25945,8811,3846,7930,1826,16033,409,3846,7930,1826,63828,16876,13,12095,6316,18694,409,1925,76605,88286,514,40884,569,11,3930,9880,8065,39580,93658,11,389,5019,969,1208,15562,261,409,18336,8082,11,409,18336,44618,6033,294,6,23265,309,44618,11,28800,1179,68,13,27058,3154,519,11,264,2442,12,6853,514,64079,63828,43310,409,514,20028,11,409,514,88286,949,507,2005,13,4418,66,15562,261,26077,447,22827,409,20028,79071,14896,409,63828,16876,11,39043,11,272,17771,15562,13,1708,1105,934,17771,54312,934,54386,25692,20028,949,423,6,370,541,11,3900,47090,71751,3869,1208,23035,409,18336,8082,6316,5636,25626,4294,87782,13,5034,91558,16271,8065,64079,11,66021,1744,514,64079,1826,72450,11,1208,63683,841,326,17771,6502,13,14465,94297,23008,9211,653,69067,409,64079,11,4864,94297,6502,23008,9211,653,69067,409,63683,13,2998,51092,11,389,841,25692,6502,1208,74333,1765,653,27584,3197,11,1880,9952,653,27584,98020,11,1208,18336,8082,11,6316,54613,7930,87264,48901,20028,1208,1709,67100,11,1880,6316,47838,7930,513,2322,30532,3869,18434,265,665,3941,1131,356,17771,6502,3284,13,19421,44829,11,3900,47090,62439,29449,85722,409,7591,5589,404,3625,79165,13,4366,1565,409,18336,8082,11,272,17771,21965,40146,13,4366,1565,294,6,9035,44618,16806,11,272,17771,5636,51625,285,13,4366,1565,409,4371,2642,44618,841,17317,917,9484,55455,13,4366,1565,409,57951,31398,77,17194,11,65268,11,1826,5636,1206,1334,13,19421,44829,11,3900,47090,88661,1143,272,37470,409,55162,385,404,29905,12329,951,8045,754,645,22299,91116,409,37604,13,445,6339,45973,1208,18336,8082,3869,6800,16081,409,51223,9780,37526,11,272,17771,25945,503,14559,11,10071,39043,841,76605,55455,13510,13,1708,1105,1913,54960,11,17971,8215,355,50590,73173,13,65381,8811,9859,1195,3625,79165,11,389,26514,2182,3930,8811,383,324,8065,38900,13,1708,1105,4864,841,550,10515,1438,6502,1469,90332,5636,409,7970,383,324,9952,20662,270,4558,325,11,503,6,25632,12339,653,28800,5636,409,77463,13,19421,409,45602,11,4864,1446,2192,14707,77818,2249,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2028,8111,311,387,264,36815,315,264,8982,477,31678,2728,555,279,3229,389,279,8712,315,18336,2065,323,1202,12976,311,24020,13,578,19114,29633,430,279,7434,315,18336,2065,374,36033,1606,433,37856,6070,11,12624,477,16422,307,950,7419,11,323,14865,311,3493,32373,389,1148,7041,42675,18336,2065,627,198,791,19114,1101,9940,4861,279,23035,315,18336,2065,369,1694,26589,5382,323,16033,4633,11,902,649,3063,311,5906,17324,367,323,70847,13,2435,4284,430,4619,315,1701,40146,3878,1093,330,13584,950,2065,1359,584,1288,1005,810,24473,4221,1093,330,90162,55280,1,477,330,285,36062,380,1912,1210,198,198,791,19114,1101,29727,389,279,4360,315,1268,17047,617,16846,311,18336,2065,11,33264,9822,596,6787,311,12896,433,439,459,3187,13,2435,18046,430,1521,6787,6996,15293,323,27375,4245,311,279,55861,7138,315,279,7434,627,198,60105,279,8982,11,279,3229,5084,311,387,59416,369,264,810,82891,323,74647,79255,291,5603,311,8830,323,96178,18336,2065,13,2435,1101,47032,279,12939,31
