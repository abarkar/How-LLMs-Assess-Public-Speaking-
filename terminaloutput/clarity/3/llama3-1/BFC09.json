Unlike Karine Lemarchand, I'm not looking for a partner ideal for an agriculturalist, but for a barley variety. In fact, I'm studying plant genetics and specifically the genetics of peas. For my thesis, I'm trying to determine the ideal pea variety for intercropping with barley. Why marry a pea variety with a barley variety? Well, my scientific colleagues have already shown that this type of culture allows for improved overall yield and better management of weeds. But why are weeds bad news? Simply because they compete with the barley for light and thus slow down its development.\n\nTo identify the ideal partner to fight against weeds, how do we proceed concretely? First, the number of pea varieties is far too large to test them all. We'll have to perform a first selection among these candidates. We'll present our barley variety with a limited number of potential partners, each with very different profiles. We can imagine a first contender pea, tall, beautiful, productive, and overall quite charming, but very upright. A second, more scrawny, less sexy, more Robert than Redford, but still providing good soil coverage.\n\nThe goal here is to define a profile or set of characteristics that guarantees our pea variety will be a good competitor against weeds by comparing the results obtained from these two contenders. In my research, I have confirmed that the plant's ability to cover the bare soil with its vegetation helps in the fight against weeds. The more a pea covers the soil, the less weeds can access light and thus develop.\n\nNow that we have identified this covering power as a major characteristic in fighting against weeds, I will test 170 pea varieties from all over Europe. These 170 pea varieties also have very different characteristics, but now I have the choice of plant and determined the genetic heritage of my candidates. Finally, I can compare this genetic information with the amount of weeds present in each of my pea-barley plots and determine which gene to take into account for a good partner, one that doesn't let weeds develop.\n\nAnd that's how I plan to present our barley variety with a pea partner.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,41621,4635,2852,53070,15878,294,2182,326,31769,2796,12769,445,58591,414,1826,7010,514,27389,65801,10071,4635,2852,53070,45325,12769,445,58591,414,1826,7010,514,35641,8345,949,1221,2221,47668,3869,13528,483,48506,1132,438,11,3846,308,17771,6502,5019,653,17744,12844,1744,4864,38317,514,961,97820,887,63497,11,10071,5019,6316,4244,39883,409,1529,978,13,2998,20272,11,503,57286,664,648,1208,78422,99188,951,73083,372,483,4881,11,1880,5636,51625,285,42625,11,1208,78422,99188,3930,46110,58883,13,19421,7010,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,259,6960,409,7591,23827,261,514,46110,58883,887,63497,5019,3625,27833,58883,16677,978,13,34447,45575,11,87320,259,1992,409,3678,1291,6316,4244,39883,409,58883,9952,6316,4244,39883,409,1529,978,949,61651,14707,11,11083,4631,4558,70,1157,7330,333,8467,14848,46939,1647,376,978,1744,3846,955,409,7829,29557,83,1339,294,58591,73511,15171,514,17634,1133,3728,11,10071,44767,409,64972,7643,25108,376,12329,3625,60014,85,22626,1077,9620,13,34447,294,6,52009,1759,11,87320,60014,85,22626,949,61651,14707,11,16968,71357,66021,934,6,37907,8175,8135,665,75332,684,9952,514,1529,978,5019,1208,41263,20712,11,1880,39587,3541,14168,4538,82620,13,34447,45575,74699,11,5019,13110,3846,961,97820,887,63497,5019,326,6339,45973,3625,60014,85,22626,1077,9620,11,4068,682,2439,5392,788,13988,978,1126,3613,81,4558,79507,949,80905,294,6,370,541,11,514,13026,409,4244,10515,5512,409,58883,3073,15844,1826,14707,21965,3062,13,7695,1826,39587,28093,346,24694,409,38211,326,6,49575,951,5803,1900,3419,23202,2053,13,7695,11412,39587,26564,385,404,2515,8977,6316,55133,71132,1370,8318,27750,36852,4918,13,48109,682,2439,39587,30179,1992,3869,29449,4244,39883,409,1529,978,653,13026,2800,265,396,409,5803,1900,11,10071,9952,951,2848,8839,25945,85114,13,1952,25692,39587,6669,10670,653,21134,550,10515,20995,409,58883,11,6800,11,72006,11,2027,333,11,1794,2727,43905,25945,19266,1072,285,519,11,10071,25945,8679,978,13,1252,2132,11,5636,523,10515,333,11,40970,11124,11,5636,8563,1744,3816,8350,11,10071,57485,519,16968,409,27584,6316,51651,4020,65930,3930,2092,13,445,6,1735,333,49733,11,665,7809,519,514,65285,266,4615,1509,1370,12155,26633,550,10515,29410,11,1826,409,7591,5589,404,653,53454,11,653,40126,409,57705,978,2889,8467,7930,40192,79738,3869,29449,58883,294,93825,653,7970,75332,84048,2145,12,6496,82489,951,60014,85,22626,1077,9620,13,2582,11,7010,11083,58673,2249,11,503,34155,7838,978,1744,1208,23878,13109,409,1208,628,5048,3869,1421,283,63346,514,2092,11148,3869,326,26248,579,409,829,348,19395,10515,367,11,12576,1339,7010,1208,63922,668,45973,3625,60014,85,22626,1077,9620,13,2998,20272,11,5636,653,58883,35737,4020,19456,519,11,40970,3625,60014,85,22626,1077,9620,44521,546,1046,12416,3869,1208,41263,20712,11,1880,39587,40970,84568,5019,9598,513,52895,716,13,1708,1105,74699,1744,17317,57038,3608,90859,1744,3846,68226,4020,19456,519,43989,653,57705,12339,296,11305,324,7010,1208,63922,668,45973,3625,60014,85,22626,1077,9620,11,4864,91507,20662,37291,38211,653,6800,13026,409,4244,10515,5512,409,58883,11,220,8258,11,1880,6371,17724,409,43905,326,6,31880,13,62463,220,8258,4244,10515,5512,409,58883,57485,306,84568,28463,951,57705,978,2889,8467,25945,96642,11,10071,20662,37291,11,503,34155,44767,514,60020,409,1208,628,5048,11,1880,44767,7591,23827,978,514,3352,6417,63916,78422,99188,409,326,6,49575,409,11083,5803,1900,13,435,2259,1001,11,4864,94297,93455,20662,2038,78422,99188,9952,1208,10484,13109,409,60014,85,22626,1077,9620,30179,21938,7010,95917,2957,409,11083,30409,645,58883,16677,978,11,1880,44351,7591,23827,261,26077,342,48099,59394,665,42463,5019,39929,653,7970,550,10515,20995,11,653,550,10515,20995,7930,841,93569,6502,1208,2035,10253,60014,85,22626,1077,9620,409,513,52895,716,13,19421,272,17771,44351,1744,4864,42463,30179,1992,3869,29449,4244,39883,409,1529,978,11,653,961,97820,409,58883,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2675,2351,11537,449,279,6007,1501,330,43,6,309,414,1826,7010,514,27389,1,320,29351,374,304,279,757,5967,705,719,656,499,1440,922,330,43,6,309,414,1826,7010,514,35641,1,320,29351,374,304,279,2115,12106,27140,13528,483,48506,1132,438,11,358,2846,539,3411,369,264,8427,10728,369,459,29149,380,11,719,369,264,81817,8205,13,763,2144,11,358,2846,21630,6136,56104,323,11951,279,56104,315,47136,13,1789,856,17850,11,358,2846,4560,311,8417,279,10728,98763,8205,369,958,38984,10964,449,81817,13,8595,32918,264,98763,8205,449,264,81817,8205,30,8489,11,856,12624,18105,617,2736,6982,430,420,955,315,7829,6276,369,13241,8244,7692,323,2731,6373,315,70535,13,2030,3249,527,70535,3958,3754,30,29524,1606,814,20874,449,279,81817,369,3177,323,8617,6435,1523,1202,4500,627,198,1271,10765,279,10728,8427,311,4465,2403,70535,11,1268,656,584,10570,390,4523,989,30,5629,11,279,1396,315,98763,36680,374,3117,2288,3544,311,1296,1124,682,13,1226,3358,617,311,2804,264,1176,6727,4315,1521,11426,13,1226,3358,3118,1057,81817,8205,449,264,7347,1396,3
