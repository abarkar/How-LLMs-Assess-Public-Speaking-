Imagine the Comté, which has experienced the Industrial Revolution and now faces industry difficulties. And that's very problematic because the Comté is dependent on the industry. To be more precise, the Comté is currently dominated by the energy industry, which is concentrated in the hands of Magician Alstorm and General Electrician, two lords who are more interested in other regions. Especially since the energy sector has changed and competition has become terrible. The problem is that these difficulties lead to a series of other problems. Magicians leaving, breweries closing, not enough work for hobbits. Plus all these negative elements reinforce each other. From there, how do we get out of the vicious circle? My economist self will tell you that part of the solution is that the Comté finds new sectors to develop and allows it to relaunch its economy by diversifying it. But that's where it gets stuck. Heavy past investments, a strong industrial memory, highly specialized hobbit skills - all this makes the rest of the story complicated. In other words, the Comté is blocked in a scenario. A scenario that was once positive but now ends in a dead end. I want to understand what are the elements that prevent the Comté from diversifying its activity and what are the elements that could help it change its trajectory. To do this, I will first conduct a diagnostic of the territory using statistical mapping. But when you have a global vision of the difficulties and blockages of the territory, what do you do? To answer this question, I will study the strengths and resources of the Comté by conducting interviews with hobbits. This will allow me to observe how they take control of their destiny. Because, yes, hobbits take control of their destiny. It is important to note that there exists a local ring community, composed of industry captains, elected officials, citizens, and unions, united around common projects and public policies. My goal is to understand how this community functions, who its members are, what relationships exist between them, and if the public policies they put in place allow the territory to engage in a new scenario - a very beautiful scenario.\n\nNote: This text appears to be a presentation or introduction to a thesis on the industrial development of the Comté (a fictional territory) after the destruction of the ring. The author is an economist who wants to understand the challenges facing the Comté and how it can diversify its economy and change its trajectory.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,362,9832,77492,88253,11,5019,9189,3327,72684,514,70927,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,91507,9189,15473,444,466,326,6,90446,64979,2428,294,22827,7317,6491,556,9047,22811,13,38891,89,1208,1219,123708,11,220,2636,8261,42138,1208,19814,409,326,6,20991,2933,13,4241,9425,11,3846,7317,6491,556,264,4635,84,1208,9517,65272,67965,6853,1880,74699,11,3625,5107,5512,409,326,6,485,592,7379,13,19421,272,17771,25945,52088,978,8637,2428,11,66021,1744,1120,1133,11,1208,1219,123708,1826,7591,3825,5048,409,326,6,485,592,7379,13,27058,23761,5636,51625,1082,11,1208,1219,123708,1826,1180,77776,11358,8047,1370,326,6,485,592,7379,409,326,31769,64374,1880,20662,9047,7379,1826,17576,8047,9465,3625,69236,3930,4983,3457,268,1708,27511,1880,3930,89175,98151,34395,11,26633,513,19388,1759,96308,92759,5512,1370,294,81979,38682,919,13,328,5757,412,1744,514,31237,12844,409,326,31769,64374,264,14707,2609,978,1880,1744,1208,3613,21201,1826,409,7287,17936,13,2009,5945,5979,11,272,17771,1744,27750,5107,5512,83786,25108,77,306,43905,6316,47528,294,81979,52088,66474,13,3959,4983,3457,729,7930,961,306,11,951,37138,4804,7930,68736,11,5636,79380,409,42775,5019,3625,69176,11777,13,2998,5636,11,26725,27750,33013,98942,308,19395,266,22589,513,5790,2000,1189,9465,84440,13,65381,31632,409,39015,11,4068,389,20272,5019,3460,404,3930,47562,273,32531,53819,949,445,31769,45317,17194,665,41091,11412,9189,13510,934,31109,48901,409,1208,6425,11,272,17771,1744,1208,1219,123708,71451,409,87325,31237,38647,3869,52895,716,1880,934,85217,25400,29557,73468,409,1375,11967,4538,82653,648,665,1208,21797,84554,13,34447,272,17771,39015,1744,39043,1080,1736,13,1611,326,414,5469,2793,15760,1392,1522,5512,11,6316,32118,97495,67965,6853,65058,11,951,69176,11777,10253,75332,2436,17508,76305,285,14014,11,39043,20272,1744,1208,16578,3930,48876,1826,4684,5118,8047,13,9648,55755,22011,11,1208,1219,123708,1826,14545,447,8047,7010,653,1156,10610,3370,13,1252,1156,10610,3370,7930,43989,47838,86633,20940,333,11,10071,7930,75804,88253,4751,483,7010,653,11957,6953,1355,582,13,6178,72,11,4864,5320,2249,60946,265,934,2053,15132,3625,33013,98942,7930,8654,5615,331,306,1208,1219,123708,409,21797,3125,4538,4197,13109,11,1880,3625,33013,98942,7930,11,8065,32150,556,11,5019,969,1188,326,26248,1814,3869,62439,409,9781,585,42827,13,27058,39043,11,4864,91507,294,6,370,541,1200,52424,653,15439,3930,7317,6491,556,77433,3869,6316,7558,3257,648,20719,2428,13,34447,4160,321,6496,11,6316,37291,934,54386,264,6316,11376,13509,1604,951,5107,5512,1880,951,41840,1154,3930,7317,6491,556,11,934,17771,54312,934,54386,20272,949,27058,75871,265,3869,20662,3488,11,4864,91507,14240,664,1291,3625,520,11934,1880,594,40751,409,1208,1219,123708,665,3026,519,951,1218,2171,80463,98544,81,12416,951,69176,11777,13,24703,7930,11412,757,29557,10367,294,6,31830,4068,46152,864,7521,306,28130,52087,665,1925,13,4366,346,1744,11,97507,11,3625,69176,11777,864,7521,306,28130,52087,665,1925,13,7695,47090,47929,934,35329,29253,6316,34561,94943,409,326,6,20991,2933,2254,11,40321,8047,409,61510,33903,294,6,485,592,7379,11,33013,355,11,6681,2303,729,1880,22013,292,1900,11,1880,9517,359,285,90053,409,22040,1441,1081,11099,11,951,3435,8467,78511,14295,13,3206,719,11,272,17771,409,60946,265,4068,20662,34561,94943,34501,818,11,7930,665,15132,15907,78957,11,26077,645,15132,43153,4398,9465,84440,11,1880,4502,3625,3435,8467,78511,14295,934,85217,2322,73468,665,2035,29557,73468,294,6,833,1435,514,7317,6491,556,7010,653,43453,1156,10610,3370,13,1252,25945,72006,1156,10610,3370,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,8586,374,279,11093,1495,512,198,15724,11,358,2846,2133,311,3371,499,279,3446,315,264,14964,13076,18455,11,220,2636,1667,1306,279,19814,315,279,10264,13,38891,279,1219,123708,11,902,706,10534,279,25563,22910,323,1457,12580,5064,27129,13,1628,430,596,1633,36033,1606,279,1219,123708,374,18222,389,279,5064,13,2057,387,810,24473,11,279,1219,123708,374,5131,30801,555,279,4907,5064,11,902,374,38626,304,279,6206,315,7023,12734,1708,27511,323,3331,21246,1122,11,1403,90213,889,527,810,8173,304,1023,13918,13,36625,2533,279,4907,10706,706,5614,323,10937,706,3719,17936,13,578,3575,374,430,1521,27129,3063,311,264,4101,315,1023,5435,13,7023,9818,9564,11,73802,15676,11,539,3403,990,369,69176,11777,13,12623,682,1521,8389,5540,55414,1855,1023,13,5659,1070,11,1268,656,584,636,704,315,279,43510,12960,30,3092,46215,659,690,3371,499,430,961,315,279,6425,374,430,279,1219,123708,14035,502,26593,311,2274,323,6276,433,311,1375,18930,1202,8752,555,21797,7922,433,13,2030,430,596,1405,433,5334,16075,13,29201,3347,22538,11,264,3831,13076,5044,11,7701,28175,69176,4590,7512,482,682,420,3727,279,2800,315,279,3446,17395,13,763,1023,4339,11,279,1219,123708,374,19857,304,264,15398,13,362,15398,430,574,3131,6928,719,1457,10548,304,264,5710,842,13,358,1390,311,3619,1148,527,279,5540,430,5471,279,1219,123708,505,21797,7922,1202,5820,323,1148,527,279,5540,430,1436
