The speaker, who is working on a thesis about the topic, takes the audience through a series of experiments to demonstrate the fascinating world of soap bubbles.\n\nThe text begins by asking the audience to imagine themselves in a bubbly bath, surrounded by soap suds. The speaker then asks them to open their eyes and observe the soap bubbles, noting that they are not just aesthetically pleasing but also the subject of their thesis.\n\nThe presentation is divided into two parts. In the first part, the speaker demonstrates how to clean the crease on one's wrist using soap suds. They show that when cleaning this area, no bubbles remain stuck to the skin. This leads them to wonder why sometimes, after washing with soap suds, some bubbles remain stuck while others do not.\n\nIn the second part of the presentation, the speaker introduces the concept of surface roughness and how it affects the behavior of soap bubbles. They show a photograph of the structure of soap suds and explain that the bubbles are deformed and form geometric shapes at their intersections. The tiny black lines on the image represent liquid channels within the bubbles.\n\nThe speaker then reveals that they have discovered a crucial relationship between the size of these liquid channels and the surface roughness of the skin or object being cleaned. They demonstrate how this relationship can be used to create an optimal cleaning solution, allowing them to adapt the soap suds to their individual skin type.\n\nThroughout the presentation, the speaker injects humor and whimsy, encouraging the audience to appreciate the beauty and complexity of soap bubbles. They conclude by inviting the audience to participate in their \"little science of everyday wonder\" and to take a moment to appreciate the intricate world of soap suds during their next bath.\n\nOverall, this transcript is an engaging and entertaining exploration of the fascinating properties of soap bubbles, presented in a way that is both informative and enjoyable.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,1838,23772,89,653,6800,16081,11,18728,83256,3625,20043,2249,1880,13085,89,45325,45889,2132,288,7010,653,293,467,54409,784,519,13,39783,37291,1744,9189,379,62299,11,9189,45366,6033,63346,25595,66,1133,3625,20043,2249,1880,5363,261,3625,7173,645,409,11427,263,1744,9189,47592,90053,409,9189,13,4072,645,15132,8622,333,8467,11,10071,84568,15132,28463,1647,70927,409,270,4558,325,13,19421,3846,1744,4864,66517,9952,11,4864,91507,9189,7631,261,409,326,6,4683,978,6417,1992,9952,41091,13,46706,653,21134,27138,11,17317,682,2439,17317,63762,404,294,22827,28800,409,1208,296,46651,1744,17317,57038,26725,74699,90053,409,17317,1880,9952,20662,296,46651,11,17317,682,2439,4272,998,27253,514,1922,2249,409,29449,3273,85958,13,12095,389,1239,42441,42067,842,69596,2922,6496,11,272,17771,6316,10353,25945,25595,346,409,29449,34922,13,19421,42676,389,4272,998,648,20662,10353,9952,1208,296,46651,11,389,513,17634,42463,934,6,21068,2957,7173,273,841,66167,1046,299,331,8047,13,1708,1105,39015,11,272,17771,29449,55133,88411,13,63103,2439,653,28800,5636,282,788,11,2267,19941,951,79165,94773,96642,13,62408,37291,63484,11,864,77,2439,35597,653,28800,409,296,46651,11,10071,4272,82325,2439,514,25646,409,29449,4020,451,13,64105,64,11,272,17771,6316,10353,51199,68,13,19421,87320,949,4366,346,934,80720,1826,5636,29742,361,817,13,11876,29742,35154,5512,11,934,17771,54312,1744,272,17771,949,24703,15132,409,98385,42847,1765,15265,1069,2933,13,19421,5636,3625,42847,78871,38546,11,5636,1208,29742,437,13109,29742,974,13,19421,1208,20547,306,648,35737,25626,11,27549,28463,13,62408,37291,63484,11,42676,389,4272,998,648,514,25646,409,29449,4020,451,9952,1208,296,46651,11,389,513,17634,42463,1744,3738,288,7173,645,2800,306,1046,299,331,14014,1765,1208,7479,13,1708,1105,39015,11,272,17771,43905,1208,3488,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,27058,62998,1826,54312,1744,951,37291,11,87158,4864,274,1105,409,1647,293,467,54409,784,519,11,4864,594,82,1105,15878,47053,2957,7173,273,409,11427,263,4631,8047,1765,1647,34922,949,19421,951,37291,11,4864,594,82,1105,19227,653,3686,72,7173,273,2249,949,27058,75871,265,3869,20662,3488,11,4864,757,36731,92759,8047,16968,54008,67882,3869,1208,6070,74672,316,978,376,2428,13,14465,757,36731,92759,8047,16968,54008,67882,3869,1208,6070,74672,316,978,376,2428,13,409,1208,296,46651,13,62408,6070,11,4502,9189,55162,41881,1208,46131,11,9189,47592,70374,3869,6033,63346,3625,20043,2249,1765,20662,10512,648,1744,503,34155,85424,37953,294,31109,409,11083,1367,28154,2436,13,24703,934,54386,379,4160,275,11,272,17771,1744,3625,7173,645,15132,7591,630,14014,3625,653,288,45973,3625,46106,13,4072,645,369,479,951,1376,288,74672,316,978,376,8467,13,19421,3869,28130,19801,11,9189,23933,10333,409,86696,25022,912,17260,13,62463,25022,912,17260,15132,665,20272,951,649,12249,409,12046,579,13,19421,1208,62827,409,27750,649,12249,11412,7591,3825,265,3869,1208,37291,409,326,6,28400,307,13109,409,1208,296,46651,1880,409,1208,62827,951,7173,645,409,11427,263,13,1952,25692,39587,62439,1208,62827,951,649,12249,13,19421,272,17771,3846,1744,4864,91507,9189,1647,95920,13,14465,91507,9189,1647,95920,653,46110,28800,1208,62827,409,27750,649,12249,13,19421,3846,1744,17317,57038,1647,376,978,9952,1647,4046,61673,11,272,17771,1744,1208,62827,409,27750,649,12249,1826,294,31109,12939,15131,20487,5019,1208,3488,1744,17317,17317,1153,919,13,2998,67781,11,87158,3625,649,12249,15132,409,1208,27584,62827,1744,3625,29742,35154,5512,1765,15265,4020,451,6033,1765,40744,3625,27529,1744,9189,55162,41881,4272,998,27253,11,45575,389,264,29449,9320,9465,4864,7591,2972,6316,296,46651,6033,4864,308,41901,7591,2972,6502,3930,16968,13,5034,63683,409,20662,87810,92215,23761,294,69537,541,11,74699,11,4864,94297,13253,1208,296,46651,1744,4864,5320,2249,75144,3869,1647,24875,409,1069,2933,13,34447,389,1522,2473,3869,81337,294,22827,28800,409,1208,3273,5512,648,409,1208,14896,1841,4864,9189,5534,2192,1744,272,17771,6316,51651,887,8047,13,14465,9189,5534,2192,1744,272,17771,6316,51651,887,8047,13,14465,9189,5534,2192,1744,272,17771,6316,51651,887,8047,13,14465,9189,5534,2192,1744,272,17771,6316,51651,887,8047,13,3341,4864,9189,3709,635,3846,57992,11,42676,9189,274,34886,20662,37291,63484,7010,653,83195,293,467,54409,784,519,11,3869,9189,5869,9211,45889,2132,288,1765,326,31769,783,77,5048,6485,13109,409,1208,296,46651,1744,9189,47592,9765,462,447,8047,28463,51794,479,13,19421,3869,9189,1008,263,1215,11,841,87264,54312,1744,45889,2132,288,11,3869,3846,1744,503,53149,6853,7643,38920,8198,409,326,31769,1195,588,321,1001,99568,3675,13,14465,9189,22114,3869,514,20028,3869,46496,6033,29263,13,25145,72,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,50189,323,70205,950,1495,0,1102,596,264,36815,315,264,15864,922,27883,44783,323,872,6012,13,578,19114,11,889,374,3318,389,264,17850,922,279,8712,11,5097,279,10877,1555,264,4101,315,21896,311,20461,279,27387,1917,315,27883,44783,627,198,791,1495,1230
