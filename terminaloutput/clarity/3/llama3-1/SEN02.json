The speaker argues that traditional methods are flawed and can lead to errors of several decades. Instead, they propose an acoustic approach that exploits the unique signatures generated by each bone as it responds to specific ultrasonic frequencies.\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. **The Problem:** Traditional methods for dating human remains, such as chemical analysis, are prone to errors due to the degradation of evidence over time.\n2. **Acoustic Dating:** The speaker proposes an acoustic approach that uses ultrasonic vibrations to date bones. Each bone has a unique signature response to specific frequencies, which can be used to determine its age.\n3. **The Science:** The speaker explains how the vibration patterns of each bone are influenced by factors like sex, age, and diet. By analyzing these patterns, researchers can infer the age of the bone with greater accuracy.\n4. **The Potential:** This new method has the potential to revolutionize the field of forensic science, allowing investigators to date human remains more precisely and accurately.\n\n**Conclusion:** The speaker invites us to imagine a future where we can \"date\" bones just like we dance at a nightclub â€“ by analyzing their unique signatures. With this novel approach, we may finally be able to reduce errors in dating human remains and bring closure to families and investigators alike.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,2564,362,9832,77492,88253,11,3846,934,54386,9189,62163,11,272,17771,409,90194,1208,94721,57485,367,13,27058,1744,3846,45441,41091,11,4864,100164,26633,2671,13,2100,275,20028,1208,94721,57485,367,11,45441,1043,48670,26725,3625,46106,35135,82,13,19421,1370,6140,11,4864,63762,86966,1133,4068,259,8977,26077,447,22827,15878,23761,304,47391,39883,1370,1208,12437,13,7695,8657,275,409,14707,272,11252,514,34922,1880,294,6,57558,265,514,121372,2192,409,22866,13,5034,22866,11,272,17771,653,28800,1208,2457,409,64032,1864,562,294,22827,757,5757,265,13,62293,514,27138,11,3625,864,84,2396,513,7591,6902,306,11,4502,14707,934,6,60917,12416,220,508,8261,11,84568,841,15132,5636,2215,85,4893,77558,653,63992,13,19421,39587,11,81621,3846,121372,2192,11,4864,36731,41664,4618,13,13789,11,97507,11,4502,26077,447,22827,71451,514,34922,33670,11,39043,513,4684,2428,653,28800,11,10071,4864,841,296,52152,47391,66522,6502,21965,13,5034,4379,1589,61334,6853,11412,665,67781,294,977,514,32232,10010,11,5019,47929,4502,514,121372,2192,409,22866,1826,81621,6033,2536,13,34447,4864,4635,2852,28130,98652,11,272,17771,951,3338,811,38094,8467,1880,84568,893,17187,28128,1001,409,51625,1854,13,19421,97507,11,389,1826,26725,85114,13,19421,1208,18528,409,12155,2709,767,648,65735,29449,16354,11,29449,29005,713,6033,35597,12155,6183,21237,38450,17724,13,7440,978,4474,949,362,1791,359,2709,841,17536,484,275,4839,1133,409,1208,27584,85722,13,19421,3625,56549,1759,409,3338,367,15132,1370,86633,409,51854,43386,33903,294,6,1036,14014,13,19421,272,17771,1120,1133,39043,934,54386,42775,273,11,665,37622,1744,52571,324,20662,37291,13,356,17771,294,26248,1814,1208,4379,3869,9517,1072,556,20662,296,2812,294,6,71656,665,68866,519,6316,48659,98652,409,3338,367,14707,5636,51625,1082,13,19421,73103,63484,308,17771,6502,38094,2428,11,10071,1645,26169,2428,13,507,2005,11,4864,2457,9952,409,1208,89669,13,64105,64,9189,4046,783,818,949,3263,42441,89,3625,3369,1441,934,80720,264,1765,17317,11,665,712,25108,668,409,85434,13,1952,9279,325,11,1880,389,841,9279,325,6502,26725,409,1208,27584,85722,13,14465,5534,2852,27584,1744,95917,359,264,4538,83187,1742,13,1952,264,829,12223,1765,1208,281,17194,13,19421,14707,11,5019,11083,259,581,3557,11,665,5589,11,6502,3625,9686,729,11,66056,1744,1208,4379,1589,61334,6853,757,3116,45168,9395,481,479,11,503,34155,84228,64591,653,52962,1133,1675,10746,556,13,9424,34965,3869,653,3738,955,409,89669,11,665,326,6,14310,21201,951,37232,99949,11,46152,513,2322,73468,3869,17358,261,13,19421,43153,54409,12760,15132,4502,54008,4918,1744,45602,274,53149,1415,68,3869,409,1208,9279,325,13,39783,9279,325,8065,9517,79,62704,2847,288,4017,978,11,40321,8047,409,56321,12678,934,54386,917,6853,26168,11,95560,290,1880,67504,607,1001,13,67261,11,95560,290,11,67504,607,1001,13,19421,14707,11,1208,9279,325,11,272,17771,1208,27584,14896,1744,1208,9279,325,3869,4538,1742,409,9279,325,11,6033,829,85722,409,9517,351,404,10253,37232,99949,13,1952,917,6853,39043,829,12223,1645,26169,2428,13,1708,1105,11,503,6,306,1438,46939,3625,282,49530,2402,757,13510,12769,69327,2852,11,10071,41091,4864,841,9279,325,6502,24068,321,15482,665,65385,409,57992,8047,934,81991,220,18,69225,288,3869,220,20,76145,3930,5634,13,8345,19421,272,17771,83195,13,445,57286,266,3930,9279,325,324,513,9517,85,51453,3869,30517,829,9279,325,11,7930,767,648,65735,4538,9637,2249,294,83508,43296,17060,648,6033,4538,14240,266,409,36709,13,19421,14707,11,1208,9279,325,294,22827,2709,1826,28463,6791,967,8047,1370,76076,1719,75104,11,22299,1208,7138,3930,83259,39723,3900,264,19266,73,3514,978,11,6033,514,27138,934,35329,264,81621,32592,88026,13,3206,719,11,272,17771,1120,1133,409,46131,3846,1744,326,54386,25692,20028,13,356,17771,1120,1133,409,11083,7889,326,52152,41116,409,3846,27138,294,41901,69,283,50753,11,6033,27138,1772,90653,336,11,1765,1208,12223,1645,26169,2428,294,22827,2709,11,54401,409,68226,665,54606,514,294,977,5636,51625,285,42625,13,2998,79071,80444,11,4864,28068,68,8065,2307,23895,324,409,712,25108,668,409,85434,13,69327,2852,11,66090,7930,92215,13510,3869,653,2709,11,55455,934,41901,9466,519,829,85722,409,7010,261,11,12769,473,978,11,76420,39015,1481,300,11,3355,729,49733,13,8345,350,77025,60019,97717,1744,9964,94297,20028,39043,949,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5992,1093,499,3077,2751,264,36815,505,264,8753,1495,922,5029,3823,8625,1701,37232,43375,78352,0,11410,236,114,5810,596,856,4879,311,16343,279,22755,1473,9,9,3936,68063,330,66230,11344,5031,1771,449,67957,1525,1233,25,362,1561,54184,1875,9,9,19791,68063,763,420,3137,11,584,3358,13488,264,11775,1749,369,5029,3823,8625,1701,37232,43375,78352,13,578,19114,29633,430,8776,5528,527,48008,323,649,3063,311,6103,315,3892,11026,13,12361,11,814,30714,459,45166,5603,430,63488,279,5016,33728,8066,555,1855,17685,439,433,31680,311,3230,37232,43375,34873,382,9,9,1622,21387,68063,198,198,16,13,3146,791,22854,68063,46560,5528,369,5029,
