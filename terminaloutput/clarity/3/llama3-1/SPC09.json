Tomorrow, computer technology will do it quickly and accurately. What's the advantage? We'll know the car number before the draw. I'll explain it to you later. First, let me talk about air safety.\n\nIn aerial domains, we can study an airplane's history just after landing, but not quickly enough to predict whether its next flight will be risky or not. Let me explain. An airliner has over 6,000 sensors that record a lot of information on all its components. To give you an idea, within only one hour of flight, we'll have more than 2 billion pieces of data. We're going to look for millions and billions of recorded numbers. If we look at these data, it will feel like being in front of an enormous library with books to read and analyze. Within those billions of data points, we're looking only for those that can be linked to abnormal behaviors. For example, a sudden temperature or pressure change that tells us one of the components is damaged.\n\nThe search for these abnormal behaviors is important. The search for these patterns in large quantities of data is currently not possible before the plane can take off again. But don't panic, my dear publics. That's where I intervene. One of the goals of my thesis is to develop rapid analysis techniques. To do this, I'm inspired by a simple and effective idea: an index. We all know what an index is from school. We used it to quickly find information without having to read the entire book. I'm using the same principle.\n\nI've reduced the amount of data analyzed to quickly find the information that interests us. So, I started by developing techniques, mathematical models that allowed me... (gets lost in thought) ...to create mathematical models for... mathematical models... Excuse me. Thank you.\n\n(Note: The transcript is an approximation of the original text, as it was not written in a clear and concise
