Here's my attempt to translate it:\n\n\"I'm reporting live from Fontainebleau, sent special to comment on the state of this forest. So our French forests are doing well? Listen, I see moss, mushrooms, branches, leaves - everything looks pretty good for now.\" This journalist doesn't know what to say. It's normal for now. Scientists have a hard time knowing if a forest is doing well or not. They can partly evaluate the threats that weigh on it and the damage that can be caused.\n\nBut to be able to say that everything is okay, simply being unaware of any degradation isn't enough. That's why I want to understand how the forest functions to evaluate its ecological state. But the problem is that we can't ask it, so what about this morning? Well or badly are the trees, the old woods, the Smiths... And yet, it's been 10 years since I'd like to have asked the question. But, as an aside, for the past 10 years, with my colleagues, we've been studying forest ecosystems and biodiversity to build indicators of their ecological state. We wonder, for example, what area a forest needs to develop optimally or how much dead wood is necessary to continue enriching the soil.\n\nBut faced with the lack of knowledge, a few years ago, we turned to research. So, with the support of my team, I started a thesis in which I pose two questions. The first one concerns climate change. Scientists have demonstrated its impact on plants, but we still need results on ecosystems. I therefore gathered thousands of plant surveys done over more than a century and compiled them into an enormous database. I deduced the types of forests in which they were conducted. And I was able to highlight that already in mountainous regions, 11% of forest ecosystems have evolved towards warmer environments than before. 11% is a significant upheaval.\n\nAnd parallel to this, other threats had been identified for a long time, such as soil compaction or invasive exotic species. That's why, since the 1990s, Europe has given us objectives and means to act. Foresters are therefore putting measures in place on the ground to protect the forest and its biodiversity.\n\nBut finally, is this working? That's the second question I pose. Are public policies favoring biodiversity effective? Are our efforts sufficient? To answer that, I will compare protected forests with those that aren't, because, ultimately, our goal isn't just to know how forests are doing. And that's only a step. The ultimate aim is for them to be in good condition. I'm touching wood.\"\n\nI hope this translation does justice to your delightful piece of French
