Let's take ketchup for example. We shake its bottle before each use. But why? This gesture may seem natural, but actually, we apply this force of shaking to make the ketchup more fluid and easier to flow towards our sandwich or pizza, in my case. We say then that the ketchup deforms to pass from a nearly solid, very viscous state to a more liquid state. If we leave this same ketchup resting for 15 minutes, it will recover its initial very viscous state before it deformed. The science that studies the parameters linking the force of deformation applied by our hand to the movement of ketchup is called rheology, which is a branch of mechanics. In addition to explaining phenomena like that of ketchup, rheology also serves to manipulate the behavior of materials to make them pleasant to use. We can use it for example to manufacture a paint that is easy to apply, an injection that is comfortable to take, or as in my study, a liquid used to drill a petroleum well.\n\nA petroleum well? Well, yes! A petroleum well can reach 10 kilometers deep. It's therefore impossible to drill such a depth without filling the well with a fluid that prevents it from collapsing. To do this, we fill the well with a fluid called drilling fluid. In addition to maintaining the walls of the well, the drilling fluid also serves to cool down the drilling tool whose temperature can exceed 100Â°C. Therefore, to meet this industrial requirement, it is necessary to understand the rheological behavior of this fluid, which means the relationship between its deformation and flow. And that's where I come in.\n\nI begin by preparing a model fluid that has the same rheological behavior as a construction site fluid. To do this, I prepare an emulsion in gasoline-water by adding a chemical stabilizer that will link the two immiscible phases, since you know, water and oil don't get along too well. Then, I add clay to absorb part of the gasoline and make my emulsion more viscous. Once my model fluid is ready, instead of spending my days shaking it to study its behavior, I use an apparatus called a rheometer that will apply forces of deformation with varying intensity on a small amount of gas. I will therefore change the behavior of this model fluid by changing some parameters such as temperature and resting time. These results give me the possibility to predict the behavior of this fluid if one of these mentioned parameters changes suddenly.\n\nIn summary, the purpose of my thesis is to understand the rheological behavior of drilling fluid and make it more ecological by changing its composition. And that's all just for the sake of our planet.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,14465,23289,1744,9189,47592,46939,42587,978,3625,293,2182,31355,409,19737,934,54386,71451,7010,3625,5043,64567,82,13,393,1466,2439,514,597,91997,1370,51173,13,1952,5819,283,68,829,293,2182,4618,33670,46777,4186,8082,13,34447,87320,949,24703,13033,68,25692,3429,66014,7138,75,11,10071,665,20272,11,389,17537,2428,20662,5457,409,5819,283,1133,5019,1744,514,597,91997,3567,26584,5636,20236,579,1880,5019,934,35329,274,6,20243,283,273,5636,51794,479,5553,29449,28974,6033,23317,11,7010,1647,4865,13,1952,22011,45575,1744,514,597,91997,513,7591,76701,5019,45347,294,22827,14240,266,1685,593,2092,579,11,25945,2145,593,2249,11,5553,653,14240,266,96308,12046,579,13,12095,389,93569,3846,27584,597,91997,312,20672,220,868,4520,11,3900,11412,38831,15170,4538,14240,266,2926,25945,2145,593,2249,33670,934,35329,513,7591,76701,13,5034,8198,7930,14240,664,648,3625,1719,75104,908,519,1208,5457,409,7591,1659,17537,5118,8047,1370,29449,1925,8065,54409,7986,3930,597,91997,274,53149,6853,1208,68132,38469,11,7930,1826,6316,1488,20712,409,1208,32118,4919,2428,13,2998,5636,294,6,30992,72684,951,1343,98078,4558,4978,22299,66090,3930,597,91997,11,1208,68132,38469,113147,28463,3869,14951,8646,3625,52962,3808,951,86374,4298,2249,5019,934,85217,779,1188,40574,978,4893,3869,326,100017,13,1952,25692,326,49963,12329,1370,51173,5019,9765,462,16339,6316,1069,396,554,7930,45441,51794,3869,326,6,5242,11,6316,26127,7930,45441,67009,481,3869,59394,11,6033,22299,7010,514,4865,409,1647,14240,799,11,653,12046,579,934,54386,69152,5019,1922,882,653,281,12059,281,10515,299,5741,13,1252,12046,579,5019,369,261,653,281,12059,281,10515,299,5741,949,61651,14707,97507,758,1252,281,12059,281,10515,299,5741,25692,93381,71933,6316,43386,8511,409,15395,316,75104,409,2848,17675,324,13,7695,1826,39587,12266,409,369,261,6316,259,6853,2848,17675,324,16968,665,1208,66262,514,281,12059,23895,11,44829,447,35329,10025,593,409,274,6,6581,2159,38149,13,27058,45602,11,389,1323,2344,514,281,12059,294,22827,12046,579,7930,274,53149,6853,20236,579,409,369,425,13,2998,5636,3930,5088,3675,951,1370,30148,3930,281,12059,11,514,20236,579,409,369,425,113147,28463,3869,2098,1607,404,326,6,31258,409,369,425,15890,1208,2798,14081,1598,25692,7591,6519,261,3625,220,1041,32037,13,4418,66,11,5019,75871,265,3869,3846,17779,294,58736,343,768,67965,6853,11,3900,1826,100243,409,60946,265,514,52962,1133,22408,978,1640,2428,409,3846,20236,579,11,3846,7930,76605,13510,1208,12976,9465,829,7591,1659,1880,4538,4046,23045,1001,13,19421,272,17771,39015,39723,503,55624,651,80463,13,14465,56445,1370,27389,62219,653,20236,579,83597,7930,264,514,27584,52962,1133,22408,978,1640,2428,934,22827,20236,579,409,44453,1291,13,27058,45602,11,4864,27389,3462,6316,4046,76,34003,665,6962,74913,5773,2933,665,92528,412,519,653,27276,33226,38094,2428,7930,11412,908,261,3625,26633,35530,4998,285,21041,11,44829,593,9189,3665,89,11,326,93847,1880,326,6,17156,458,841,274,6,2706,306,6502,21965,13,2998,51092,11,4864,92528,2182,409,326,6,867,458,7930,11412,15938,655,6316,48901,3930,6962,74913,1880,39587,98054,1647,4046,76,34003,5636,2145,593,817,13,39783,37291,1647,20236,579,83597,550,49530,11,1880,8065,39381,409,45347,11083,503,3514,14014,3869,514,5819,283,261,5019,14240,664,1291,4538,52962,1133,11,503,49963,1082,653,97262,321,7930,274,53149,6853,514,18803,316,99746,1880,7930,11412,17537,72684,951,8603,409,7591,1659,294,55624,729,13109,4244,8047,1765,6316,38920,10484,13109,409,56086,13,14465,91507,39587,62439,514,52962,1133,409,3846,20236,579,83597,665,2349,519,45889,1719,75104,259,2053,1744,1208,2798,14081,1598,1880,514,27138,409,46874,13,62463,100246,757,33537,306,1208,67239,978,409,550,15433,556,514,52962,1133,409,3846,20236,579,4502,326,22827,951,1719,75104,6420,77,5512,2349,107954,467,1133,13,4418,66,4160,321,6496,11,5019,9517,12023,11,514,719,409,7643,270,4558,325,1826,409,60946,265,514,52962,1133,22408,978,1640,2428,3930,20236,579,409,369,425,1880,409,514,98054,5636,91329,1640,2428,665,2349,519,829,18528,13,19421,16968,39043,308,17771,1744,5019,514,14707,409,29449,3197,66522,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,8586,374,279,36815,449,37793,1473,9,9,49873,25823,334,198,198,40,23289,499,3077,2736,1511,279,9955,3904,27474,1766,304,5043,64567,82,13,6914,596,1935,597,91997,369,3187,13,1226,27116,1202,16893,1603,1855,1005,13,2030,3249,30,1115,31257,1253,2873,5933,11,719,3604,11,584,3881,420,5457,315,38839,311,1304,279,597,91997,810,15962,323,8831,311,6530,7119,1057,28974,477,23317,11,304,856,1162,13,1226,2019,1243,430,279,597,91997,409,10008,311,1522,505,264,7154,6573,11,1633,59665,788,1614,311,264,810,14812,1614,13,1442,584,5387,420,1890,597,91997,41219,369,220,868,4520,11,433,690,11993,1202,2926,1633,59665,788,1614,1603,433,409,10365,13,578,8198,430,7978,279,5137,31799,279,5457,315,91621,9435,555,1057,1450,311,279,7351,315,597,91997,374,2663,68132,2508,11,902,374,264,9046,315,30126,13,763,5369,311,26073,44247,1093,43
