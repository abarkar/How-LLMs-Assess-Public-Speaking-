To start, I want you to take a moment to imagine all the digital data in the world. Images, texts, videos, and more - all stored on servers around the planet. And now, try to imagine the volumes required for all of this data. It's not easy. So, do you know how many years it would take to store all of these data peripherally before we start using them? Even a maximum amount. Well, if I told you that I've stored all of this data in a single file cabinet, and a scientist could recover the correct sequence from ice-age preservation... There are two interesting things about this story. First, as I already said, ice preserves all the necessary information for living organisms to survive for 40,000 years. But there's still a missing 10% that hasn't been evaluated yet. So, the idea isn't to use them to go extinct in numbers. No. On the one hand, DNA is a sequence of four different elements that we obtain by drawing letters A, B, C, and G. On the other hand, digital data are expressed as a sequence from 0 to 1. However, it's good. By passing from digital data to DNA, it consists in information stored on a table with a sequence of A, B, C, and G for an hour. That's the last part of the hour. But we've already started working on this idea in my laboratory. The first part of my work involves using an effective algorithm for pedagogy in terms of competition. A pedal sequence is then used by biologists to synthesize DNA. And then, society gives very small criticisms. For example, one algorithm is used to express a park's data in numerical format. To learn more, we've retrieved a specific element from the data. This is a fact that biologists can be proud of. For example, a technology using separators and special machines that diffuse sequence amplifiers. But the most decisive part is actually this procedure of the council and other genres. And here's the second part of my work. I'll show you how we can ensure that these pedagogical techniques are all the same. With these pedagogical techniques, mutual gestures and manuals could exist in just one kilo of amplifiers. Which is a bit crazy, a bit aggressive. You might think it's science fiction. But no. All secrets are there. They're simply science.]\n\nPlease note that this transcript appears to be from a scientific lecture or presentation on DNA sequencing and digital data storage, and may contain technical jargon and specialized terminology.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,1717,232,10367,550,49530,3869,91727,3846,934,17771,7010,514,1343,98078,48099,7930,25692,5347,78562,3709,3433,481,13,27058,1081,20099,11,4864,5320,2249,1744,9189,864,11044,89,653,4545,5019,6669,10670,40744,3625,46681,51307,8467,3930,38900,13,11876,5448,11,3625,1495,288,11,3625,72886,7930,15132,7858,14014,1765,514,2816,2700,5512,1765,1208,3197,66522,13,19421,74699,11,9071,10333,409,6669,10670,3625,27378,63846,17724,5019,3846,1744,25692,513,71751,13,622,34155,1370,84,1744,272,17771,6502,51794,13,4366,45575,11,3665,89,45325,3698,3675,294,6,1036,14014,25692,294,7889,3625,5708,1154,7930,78871,84411,764,28154,14295,33670,409,1081,20099,3869,513,45347,949,12623,33670,294,22827,7340,13,1708,1105,11,4502,4864,9189,834,2852,1744,503,34155,7565,1002,978,40744,27750,46681,7010,6316,712,25108,668,3869,30075,4918,11,1880,1744,3846,1744,9189,4046,4253,55745,665,26633,3009,65039,11,514,7330,52760,44521,1339,84788,72,3869,79196,52424,1208,51651,294,58591,11178,817,934,54386,30179,651,1339,7010,1208,2840,580,1180,2428,13,7695,379,264,26633,79165,92759,15844,7010,20662,87810,13,423,6,370,541,11,22299,4864,326,34155,46939,22011,11,1208,2840,580,60172,40744,3625,44827,63846,17724,10253,47120,288,18434,1821,409,4538,18027,4046,10629,17060,2428,5019,1208,1794,2727,4618,13,7639,547,949,356,17771,653,7970,27138,11,3869,220,1272,220,931,8261,13,34447,3900,66167,44093,220,605,31656,13,356,17771,1208,1794,2727,7930,308,26248,6502,4046,26591,8047,13,1708,1105,11,326,27688,8047,308,17771,6502,409,3625,75144,5019,274,31769,668,71933,7010,3625,1661,28154,14295,13,507,2005,13,423,31109,961,11,1208,65436,1826,6316,19266,4474,409,220,19,33013,98942,85114,11,1744,326,54386,264,326,6,677,83,1188,409,21273,10670,1370,3625,1095,45632,362,11,426,11,356,1880,356,13,423,49455,265,961,11,3625,46681,1661,28154,14295,15132,15522,318,14014,1765,1208,1794,2727,294,31109,19266,4474,294,31109,77818,11,409,220,15,3869,220,16,13,4366,45973,11,272,17771,7970,13,2998,1522,519,951,46681,1661,28154,14295,3869,1208,65436,11,3900,6824,68,11,42844,6316,2038,281,10746,556,11,3869,6316,19266,4474,5769,74775,409,362,11,426,11,356,1880,480,13,356,17771,1208,88818,409,326,6,75876,13,34447,17317,57038,46939,59062,978,3869,58673,15610,1765,20662,887,8047,7010,1647,9511,67763,13,5034,55133,48901,409,1647,42775,6824,68,3869,75144,653,453,6191,2727,409,281,15433,425,31914,580,665,4751,288,409,75332,684,13,39783,19266,4474,409,281,15433,1604,1826,76826,42587,8047,1370,951,88704,288,5019,1208,43998,10515,12329,32592,1208,57128,409,294,15564,13,19421,44829,11,1208,77824,21559,951,87313,25945,98385,13,4366,51173,11,389,60172,653,453,6191,2727,5019,15522,3212,653,45740,665,46681,1661,28154,14295,13,27058,665,47929,5636,11,389,264,79196,68862,653,33013,42625,409,1208,33537,8047,665,71269,52760,13,356,17771,653,20272,1744,88704,288,56311,23761,14240,278,519,5019,326,6,391,403,13,4366,51173,11,6316,2869,38469,665,42587,519,951,19266,1768,36306,11,951,12933,71269,33888,7930,3722,355,306,3625,19266,45045,294,65948,19131,13,34447,1208,48901,1208,5636,35881,285,535,11,272,17771,665,20272,20662,13988,15433,554,409,3846,31025,321,1880,27750,46106,36744,13,19421,49733,11,272,17771,1208,26633,90272,48901,409,1647,42775,13,14465,91507,9189,1647,95920,4068,389,25692,274,6,395,7889,1744,3625,12823,409,281,15433,425,31914,2492,15132,40744,3625,123299,9004,13,62293,27750,12823,409,281,15433,425,11,3625,13033,288,409,281,15433,1604,1880,3625,893,61244,5318,61244,5019,969,1188,506,1601,7010,71686,653,15395,78,294,65948,19131,13,24703,7930,1826,653,28800,1652,354,52009,11,653,28800,945,676,333,13,1952,92215,14425,556,3869,6316,6917,409,8198,74531,13,34447,2536,13,350,788,3625,24511,15132,39015,13,81245,15132,13,81245,15132,71357,409,1208,8198,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,8586,374,279,36815,449,6498,14807,1473,9,9,49873,25823,334,198,198,58,11787,499,5644,311,7142,1148,596,4871,420,25885,430,1253,2873,15400,30,2057,1212,11,358,1390,499,311,1935,264,4545,311,13085,682,279,7528,828,304,279,1917,13,12041,11,22755,11,6946,11,323,810,482,682,9967,389,16692,2212,279,11841,13,1628,1457,11,1456,311,13085,279,27378,2631,369,682,315,420,828,13,1102,596,539,4228,13,2100,11,656,499,1440,1268,1690,1667,433,1053,1935,311,3637,682,315,1521,828,824,10781,750,1603,584,1212,1701,1124,30,7570,264,7340,3392,13,8489,11,422,358,3309,499,430,358,3077,9967,682,315,420,828,304,264,3254,1052,22685,11,323,264,28568,1436,11993,279,4495,8668,505,10054,44041,46643,1131,2684,527,1403,7185,2574,922,420,3446,13,5629,11,439,358,2736,1071,11,10054,75998,682,279,5995,2038,369,5496,44304,311,18167,369,220,1272,11,931,1667,13,2030,1070,596,2103,264,7554,220,605,4,430,12775,956,1027,26126,3686,13,2100,11,279,4623,4536,956,311,1005,1124,311,733,69918,304,5219,13,2360,13,1952,279,832,1450,11,15922,374,264,8668,315,3116,2204,5540,430,584,6994,555,13633,12197,362,11,426,11,356,11,323,480,13,1952,279,1023,1450,11,7528,8
