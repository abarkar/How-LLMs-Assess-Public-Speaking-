They explain that metabolism refers to the process by which Chiara's body breaks down the croquettes into nutrients and energy. Similarly, the speaker notes that territories also have a metabolism, albeit on a much larger scale.\n\nThe speaker compares a city to a large animal, with humans playing the role of cells or organs within it. Just as Chiara's body needs food to function, cities need resources such as wood, oil, metals, and more to maintain their economy. The speaker notes that just as Chiara consumes, transforms, and eliminates waste, cities consume and process resources, producing waste in the form of pollution, emissions, or other byproducts.\n\nThe speaker explains that analyzing a city's metabolism is a complex task requiring the collection of vast amounts of data on topics such as agriculture, mining, air and water pollution, waste disposal, and transportation. They note that their work involves developing tools to manage and analyze these large datasets, allowing them to answer questions about what resources are being consumed or produced by a given territory.\n\nThe speaker sees themselves as working towards creating a new profession, akin to a dietician for territories, which would help find sustainable solutions for cities' consumption patterns. They hope that their work will contribute to developing tools to help cities function more durably and sustainably.\n\nOverall, the text is an interesting reflection on how concepts from biology can be applied to understanding complex systems like cities or regions, and how data analysis and visualization can help us better understand these systems and make more informed decisions about resource management.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,622,34155,653,10065,409,83491,648,11,6316,38920,54951,7930,274,53149,6853,34382,5169,13,34382,5169,11,4864,25400,21559,26725,3625,49301,50026,220,1135,69225,288,409,14425,24181,2392,13,39783,37291,6892,14081,14014,11,27750,14425,24181,2392,82133,513,43678,7010,4538,2942,44618,1880,3127,52424,3625,10184,6417,812,1880,326,31769,64374,934,6,37907,687,72,89810,5019,25400,29557,10367,409,2800,261,8065,1948,409,829,57128,13,362,1208,1913,3930,1920,355,11,3900,66167,45889,7591,331,1441,1744,34382,5169,51913,582,361,32592,57128,409,98385,272,4744,2392,13,5034,10484,13109,294,83508,12843,6892,14081,5512,11,1208,76407,15890,46152,513,1380,2000,479,7010,326,6,8629,44618,1880,3846,7930,665,594,7003,11,16968,39043,11,272,17771,3846,934,54386,917,6853,514,32118,6323,337,44618,294,22827,2942,44618,13,34447,41091,11,4864,841,36731,6502,88704,68,11,4864,308,57286,664,648,6502,3625,47120,288,18434,1821,13,14465,36731,74672,540,4714,383,1880,503,57286,664,648,951,7317,6491,3946,11,951,26886,645,11,951,38682,919,11,951,21935,13,19421,27584,4502,27750,7317,6491,3946,308,6,546,6502,6800,14896,3869,46131,9952,34382,5169,11,46152,14848,11,84440,28463,11,653,32118,6323,337,44618,13,38891,89,6316,39973,22299,653,25500,10065,7010,514,43014,17317,1446,919,26725,665,79071,80444,951,13509,2482,13,19421,14707,11,5019,1744,3846,25500,10065,12,8078,6669,68976,11,44829,325,34501,1215,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,5019,1744,326,31769,45317,648,7364,818,11,17317,3567,2439,29905,12329,951,594,40751,11,951,453,12843,11,3930,66304,11,3930,281,10515,5898,11,951,32118,2629,2249,11,5099,13,48109,841,60534,2439,4046,1325,336,479,6502,60019,40744,27750,594,40751,11,10071,17317,3625,1615,316,24483,11,3625,5276,2439,1880,3625,312,15769,2439,11,16968,22299,34382,5169,1615,316,2727,11,5276,68,1880,78467,6672,15907,14425,24181,2392,13,12095,4864,5320,2249,47929,3846,1744,34382,5169,1615,316,2727,11,3846,308,17771,6502,25945,77411,13,7695,8657,275,409,18541,261,15907,14425,24181,2392,33670,409,3625,25400,71751,1880,294,6,25632,52424,934,6,37907,841,893,17187,6502,13,7695,8657,275,409,18541,261,15907,14425,24181,2392,33670,409,3625,25400,71751,1880,294,6,25632,52424,934,6,37907,841,893,17187,6502,13,7695,8657,275,409,18541,261,15907,14425,24181,2392,33670,409,3625,25400,71751,1880,294,6,25632,52424,934,6,37907,841,893,17187,6502,13,34447,5019,47929,3846,1744,1615,316,2727,6033,78467,6672,653,7317,6491,556,11,1208,259,9011,1557,1826,47838,479,5636,6485,68,13,19421,3900,379,264,48488,11,48488,409,46681,3869,51010,36501,13,5034,5788,40574,292,1286,11,326,58736,27523,13726,12339,11,3625,312,75004,5553,326,6,1334,11,5553,326,93847,11,1208,57459,665,7591,14215,11,514,7710,409,15572,438,5014,1880,14707,294,81979,13,33150,2860,11,40744,5634,59307,2389,263,1072,288,11,3846,15132,51854,43386,33903,409,11990,409,52021,7930,4319,29580,46777,76132,1765,653,7317,6491,556,22299,326,6,77968,580,13,362,32384,11,1647,42775,1826,409,52895,716,951,594,40751,11,951,594,40751,7930,15132,70720,11,1880,294,49963,12329,3625,75601,2601,7930,17634,306,5636,4382,1880,5636,51794,326,57286,799,3930,32118,6323,337,44618,409,12155,7317,6491,3946,665,29557,61512,409,51010,36501,1880,294,6,69331,2058,40744,27750,46681,13,27058,45602,11,1647,6141,3357,324,1826,653,4958,84048,25945,8791,458,13,5186,12416,39929,3608,90859,514,955,294,6,26125,934,35329,47090,14951,8646,1880,52895,716,653,18629,7591,8747,978,11,4864,36731,46838,494,2852,13171,409,342,52424,409,38546,10484,35933,294,6,41540,811,13,356,8458,757,29557,409,75871,265,5636,51794,479,3869,96642,4860,3869,31632,409,46681,1437,2142,13,42215,1615,316,2727,6033,78467,6672,75249,949,507,15273,949,3489,438,949,19421,665,74940,10484,13109,949,14465,1446,2852,653,1891,10515,10515,3457,268,7930,76605,48021,34382,5169,8065,38682,547,11,4864,757,1153,81356,3625,123299,9004,4860,13,34447,3846,308,17771,6502,34382,5169,934,35329,47090,48021,8065,38682,547,13,24703,15132,14707,12155,7317,6491,3946,7930,1615,316,479,21965,409,594,40751,11,665,16968,4865,5636,1744,3846,1744,1208,3197,66522,841,25692,5790,283,899,261,13,362,32384,11,9952,1647,42775,11,503,6,25632,12339,75831,3625,704,8839,7930,29557,376,546,3869,653,43453,36252,1291,294,58736,1601,13,39783,80444,409,1891,10515,10515,3457,268,3930,7317,6491,556,7930,46524,64,514,38682,547,10737,978,5019,1744,29449,82653,648,44829,325,2018,8977,3869,34501,1215,27220,479,13,14465,36731,46838,494,2852,13171,409,342,52424,409,38546,10484,35933,294,6,41540,811,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,791,1495,374,264,36815,315,264,1732,11,4461,264,3980,42606,11,7556,922,872,990,323,1268,814,3881,279,7434,315,39097,311,8830,279,31301,315,39543,11,1778,439,9919,477,13918,11,4856,1109,1120,5496,44304,1093,10099,627,198,791,19114,12302,555,23524,872,6896,8415,11,34382,5169,11,323,1268,1364,60606,3691,304,279,1376,315,14425,24181,2392,13,2435,10552,430,39097,19813,311,279,1920,555,902,34382,5169,596,254
