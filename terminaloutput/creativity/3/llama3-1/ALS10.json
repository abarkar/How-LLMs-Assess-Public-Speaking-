It's an academic paper, written by an anthropologist who spent several months living among the Tibetan people in the Himalayas. The author reflects on their experience and how it relates to their field of study.\n\nThe title \"Rendez-vous en terre inconnue\" (Meeting in Unknown Land) is quite fitting, as the author describes their immersion in a remote village at an altitude of 35,000 meters. They lived with a family of about 300 inhabitants, speaking their language and participating in daily activities. The method used was participant observation, which allowed them to gather honest accounts from the locals.\n\nThe paper focuses on the evolution of traditional Tibetan medicine and how it has changed over generations. The author highlights the differences between two medicine practitioners: Yeshi, the father, who learned his trade through apprenticeship, and Norbu, the son, who received a modern education in medicine and traveled to the West. This generational gap led to innovations in traditional practices, such as the use of incense for medicinal purposes.\n\nThe author also touches upon the theme of cultural heritage and how it is passed down from one generation to the next. They note that Yeshi, the father, initially resisted the changes brought by his son's Western education but eventually accepted them. This reflects the tension between tradition and modernity in Tibetan society.\n\nOverall, this text is an excellent example of anthropological research and its application to understanding human cultures.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,7695,379,264,6316,4046,2796,43116,7930,274,53149,6853,12769,432,73602,45325,665,88026,304,5259,361,8345,7010,1208,88265,6316,272,29982,32414,978,961,274,6,19519,1414,7010,1208,17536,294,31109,7187,781,396,8511,13,23126,729,11,39043,757,61158,6853,3846,1744,4864,66517,11,10071,1208,2373,2536,32118,8747,266,2428,11,326,6,32329,897,38469,13,445,6,32329,897,38469,274,55624,978,22550,665,67781,10253,96642,30811,65970,2854,33903,1880,17317,22114,3869,48021,665,13356,29449,83187,3941,409,17536,13,19421,41091,11,27549,1826,39723,7643,88026,304,5259,361,949,38891,89,11,409,38546,20605,3326,288,665,818,343,14014,11,653,14458,3869,220,1758,410,296,75104,294,6,99111,11,6316,7187,8065,436,556,51794,11,3869,1208,49361,5954,77,37093,11,65198,11,4160,556,272,287,75,5048,11,17317,74533,7010,653,14458,409,326,68070,2931,12874,13,356,17771,39015,1481,300,1744,503,34155,81621,56321,37291,11,51854,46415,11,3869,18434,265,665,75657,7010,6316,7187,294,6,4775,483,259,581,10515,8511,294,41901,2842,220,3101,14464,1821,13,622,34155,25160,9952,27750,47104,11,1048,951,2807,417,9952,27750,47104,11,44314,978,28130,96282,13,27058,62998,949,4366,346,1744,272,17771,1208,98652,409,38317,409,1647,96839,294,57286,29246,11,326,6,79060,5293,5048,13,1952,1370,273,9952,3625,47104,11,389,3625,2322,665,2389,5397,1880,46152,17317,7591,34667,8135,6316,49361,5954,77,37093,13,13789,11,4864,841,9189,6636,6502,1744,514,21134,3729,1826,653,28800,77411,13,14465,757,5945,10176,729,11,4864,9189,16796,665,5589,1448,680,978,3869,1208,60172,294,22827,14458,30148,42676,11,6502,409,90509,13,1252,47838,14458,30148,39904,1880,757,22011,11,665,20272,11,13088,6868,285,6853,11,3900,47090,5790,95920,11,3900,841,47090,6502,1448,3183,13,622,6,40997,11,503,6,1683,6091,7010,1208,36105,44526,20487,11,99309,20043,2249,436,51058,757,5363,306,294,22827,3805,37539,11067,13,1952,296,6,10543,68,1913,54960,11,389,757,113147,514,76680,1880,5636,503,41901,66304,11,5636,389,296,41901,594,805,265,13,14465,841,11427,2852,6502,4068,5790,95920,11,4864,841,63762,5636,4068,31632,13,34447,1913,54960,11,4864,36731,1370,7287,3869,18434,265,7010,20662,67628,7010,1208,88265,3900,379,264,26633,32118,8332,1354,259,581,10515,1771,11,816,4385,72,514,281,12339,1880,8170,20218,514,89672,11,7930,55744,5118,306,6316,32118,8332,483,409,28130,14135,259,581,10515,8511,13,19421,272,17771,39043,7930,296,55624,978,22550,13,62463,26633,32118,8332,1354,55744,5118,306,7010,28130,47276,1880,3381,43153,35030,292,24469,3869,2385,409,6136,288,10253,447,37907,46152,14848,1046,12416,13,19421,7643,270,4558,325,60172,1765,326,31769,65272,951,92096,409,3846,47929,35030,950,13,19421,1765,3846,7930,2349,9465,1208,95234,409,816,4385,72,11,514,281,12339,11,1880,409,8170,20218,11,514,89672,13,4418,66,934,17771,54312,1744,503,6,49133,949,622,6,49133,665,20272,653,26495,978,958,70,32453,2214,8301,3062,13,816,4385,72,11,514,281,12339,11,264,917,6091,8065,14458,9952,4538,281,12339,28463,13,1708,1105,1744,4538,89672,8170,20218,264,18757,48908,7010,6316,4046,56745,409,32118,8332,483,259,581,10515,8511,11,3900,264,15925,1046,12416,3869,653,47929,5636,3544,1880,3900,264,18757,23933,1435,665,20522,1748,13,19421,75804,88253,11,3900,45640,1880,3900,95234,409,5636,665,5636,665,20522,1748,13,7695,513,17302,68,3869,409,80080,58395,3930,38900,934,35329,39474,68,3869,4538,14458,13,24703,7930,20272,1744,829,14135,6301,1009,13,4418,66,3900,11412,1370,51173,11,20028,665,5636,409,15907,35030,292,24469,11,409,326,6,967,729,35030,292,992,934,35329,19189,10253,31070,288,409,21765,13,3489,301,593,14896,1744,4538,281,12339,308,26248,6502,3930,16968,917,43711,5979,978,8065,65385,11,10071,934,35329,264,4287,978,46110,3869,46110,13,435,2259,1001,11,816,4385,72,11,514,281,12339,11,757,22011,1744,97507,11,14707,97717,11,1208,17536,8065,14458,75804,88253,11,27549,1826,5636,51794,13,34447,3900,841,4160,275,5636,22299,33670,11,951,53542,1765,3625,3091,6723,2249,45740,414,404,1208,20605,24812,13,7695,513,62163,7930,1826,54312,7930,35456,969,829,16578,5019,2515,8977,3625,21889,61244,409,1709,14081,3416,4502,4538,89672,1826,79988,1208,4647,12583,978,409,326,6,85335,665,20272,13,4418,66,272,17771,39043,326,6,32329,897,38469,13,356,17771,22842,4068,4046,12821,361,6316,77824,13,356,17771,274,6,19519,1414,665,88026,304,5259,361,5019,60946,265,3846,7930,20272,409,17317,951,20183,45632,2854,1771,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,27387,1495,0,1102,596,459,14584,5684,11,5439,555,459,41416,16549,889,7543,3892,4038,5496,4315,279,73074,1274,304,279,76438,98440,13,578,3229,27053,389,872,3217,323,1268,433,36716,311,872,2115,315,4007,627,198,791,2316,330,49,73602,45325,665,88026,304,5259,361,1,320,65676,304,22435,11680,8,374,5115,27442,11,439,279,3229,16964,872,75657,304,264,8870,14458,520,459,36958,315,220,1758,11,931,20645,13,2435,12439,449,264,3070,315,922,220,3101,40771,11,12365,872,4221,323,24435,304,7446,7640,13,578,1749,1511,574,25923,22695,11,
