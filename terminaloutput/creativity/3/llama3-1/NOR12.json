The speaker discusses their research on nuclear reactions and how they relate to the study of stars.\n\nThe first part of the transcript describes the field of astrophysics, which includes the study of planets, stars, and galaxies. The speaker notes that nuclear astrophysics is a subset of astrophysics that focuses on the study of atomic nuclei. They explain that understanding nuclear reactions can help us understand how stars are formed and what happens inside them.\n\nThe speaker then talks about how scientists have been trying to understand the nuclear reactions that occur in stars for over 100 years. They mention Jean Perrin, a French physicist who was awarded the Nobel Prize, and how he was one of the first scientists to study the process of nuclear reactions in stars.\n\nThe speaker explains that nuclear reactions are what allow stars like our sun to produce heat and light. They describe how these reactions involve the transformation of hydrogen atoms into helium, which releases energy. This energy is what makes the star shine.\n\nThe speaker then moves on to discuss their own research on binary star systems, where two stars orbit around each other. They explain that one of the stars in this system is a neutron star, which is formed when a massive star runs out of fuel and collapses under its own gravity.\n\nThe speaker notes that neutron stars are incredibly dense and have very strong magnetic fields. They describe how the other star in the binary system can be drawn towards the neutron star, forming an accretion disk around it. This disk can heat up due to friction and release energy as X-rays, which can then be detected on Earth.\n\nThe speaker mentions that this research is important for understanding the behavior of binary star systems and how they can produce X-ray emissions. They note that scientists have been studying these emissions using satellites and that this research has helped us better understand the universe.\n\nFinally, the speaker talks about their own research project, which involves accelerating particles to high speeds and colliding them with other particles to study the nuclear reactions that occur during these collisions. They explain that this research can help us better understand the processes that occur in stars and how they produce energy.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,622,57286,664,648,3625,912,7911,2249,5019,60946,265,3625,4046,998,3742,13,3206,96839,11,272,17771,326,6,561,22761,1065,2428,11148,566,978,12267,13,445,6,561,22761,1065,2428,11,272,17771,326,57286,799,951,3197,4558,2392,11,951,4046,998,3742,11,951,66017,13,445,57286,799,409,326,52152,5589,3904,6800,13,362,326,52152,4550,11,1208,64441,11148,566,978,12267,11,272,17771,326,57286,799,951,912,7911,2249,951,19670,288,7930,40321,306,16968,3846,7930,17317,1218,80284,13,4418,66,326,57286,799,409,326,52152,5589,3904,46110,13,1708,1105,11,665,75249,326,57286,799,409,27750,912,7911,2249,11412,68226,17317,29557,10367,409,60946,265,3846,7930,513,39904,7010,3625,4046,998,3742,949,62408,3488,308,17771,6502,9517,78684,11,44829,447,80720,264,24560,1153,8047,3900,379,264,220,1041,8261,13,4366,653,4571,3457,268,1880,38847,48078,55467,11,20263,86848,258,13,2998,67781,11,3900,379,264,220,1041,8261,11,389,841,11427,1339,6502,4068,1208,523,61047,1880,1208,41263,20712,3930,65615,321,97958,2558,3695,13,362,9832,77492,88253,11,389,829,275,1744,272,17771,77433,3869,1208,18475,409,220,19,912,7911,2249,294,6,67229,70,48099,665,220,16,912,88,2933,294,39982,73511,372,13,33150,45369,409,20662,18475,11,934,54386,917,6853,6316,9517,1335,11148,566,978,12267,11,6316,48901,409,28130,58617,1826,5276,8047,665,4046,64374,13,356,17771,1208,84850,4558,21152,1376,1130,469,4046,70,1604,19777,17,13,12095,326,31769,64374,4046,74306,8065,45369,409,20662,9517,1335,43989,79071,28800,51199,68,11,1208,523,61047,3930,65615,321,841,87264,6502,1208,27584,13,7695,841,18728,1339,25692,85815,5636,282,1607,13,7695,308,59858,44521,1339,25692,85815,6502,409,17536,1765,10335,265,13,14465,841,1446,2852,6502,39015,5019,9189,665,89504,1880,9189,841,33978,89,6502,39015,5019,296,6,20243,2743,13,12095,14240,664,1291,3625,9517,4109,11148,566,978,17724,17317,264,14175,285,409,60946,265,514,65615,321,11,3900,665,11412,409,27584,5019,40744,3625,4046,998,3742,13,46706,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,296,55624,978,676,2852,3869,26633,4046,998,3742,7930,958,351,79738,9465,84568,13,39783,4046,998,458,7930,594,16167,3869,29449,65615,321,1880,6316,47838,4046,998,458,934,54386,917,6853,6316,4046,998,458,3869,26878,26692,13,39783,4046,998,458,3869,26878,26692,11,272,17771,3846,7930,66167,42138,6316,39887,12949,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,1208,10237,4738,6960,294,31109,4046,998,458,13,1952,11412,513,38831,15170,9952,6316,4046,998,458,409,38920,62827,11,44829,593,829,62827,308,17771,6502,48488,5636,25626,1744,73103,409,1208,88100,41958,26584,11,10071,7930,264,6316,58617,25945,36897,13,16233,58617,1826,1043,35285,554,3869,73103,409,29449,65615,321,13,11876,912,7911,2249,409,326,49455,265,4046,998,458,7930,594,16167,3869,29449,65615,321,82133,45575,23761,1651,404,5512,1370,20662,4046,998,458,3869,26878,26692,11,274,6,40031,8646,90053,294,80720,11,44829,3869,653,4545,11,3869,5457,294,6,40031,2987,11,1208,3577,290,11412,49806,261,1880,45602,11412,7591,566,268,9211,6316,25176,13,33150,45369,409,20662,25176,11,3900,11412,379,39929,4046,2796,409,18803,2439,1630,934,54386,11412,68226,76826,85877,440,261,1765,10335,265,3869,326,26248,579,409,47710,13,423,6,52009,1759,11,3625,3383,39965,1771,7010,3625,65838,220,2031,97958,653,28800,304,47391,1441,11,66021,934,85217,84764,1188,951,47710,16948,919,1880,46152,97958,24613,329,5512,409,85877,440,261,6316,25176,11148,566,978,12267,1370,9880,13,362,9832,77492,88253,11,46152,15132,436,395,324,5512,77433,10253,12025,22761,1065,3457,729,1880,17317,28463,13,62463,123299,9004,12025,22761,1065,3457,729,11,84440,11,82133,23008,9211,3869,14843,556,27750,56506,11,10071,76680,269,81235,1765,6141,3357,324,3869,326,26248,579,409,1376,2482,7033,978,8637,8467,13,34447,5019,45602,11,46152,82133,39929,63669,409,60946,265,40744,3625,9517,4109,11148,566,978,17724,7930,44521,546,15925,39381,8065,45369,409,20662,25176,13,6178,72,11,7010,7643,270,4558,325,11,503,34155,11083,324,978,6316,409,27750,9517,4109,13,27058,45602,11,4864,91507,1046,19010,52424,951,912,7911,2249,1744,4864,91507,6233,42219,1765,294,81979,912,7911,2249,13,81245,82133,958,351,404,9465,84440,1880,3869,326,26248,579,409,85114,97262,8839,409,84921,11,4864,91507,22842,3846,7930,274,17771,81621,8065,4545,409,1208,19277,13,3206,42775,11412,76826,1615,1601,3869,14843,556,8065,64972,1880,60946,265,8065,64972,3625,96642,9517,4109,7930,14848,15925,39381,8065,4545,409,20662,19277,13,14465,91507,68226,76826,1380,4150,10367,27750,44827,10253,12025,22761,1065,3457,729,1880,58673,15610,9952,84440,1925,7010,1208,1925,54401,409,14843,556,3625,24654,12025,22761,1065,8467,13,1219,2727,75249,11,409,326,52152,5589,3904,6800,3869,326,52152,5589,3904,46110,11,3900,308,59858,264,934,22827,6502,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,791,1495,374,264,36815,315,459,7274,449,459,12025,22761,1065,292,380,889,46672,304,11499,12025,22761,17688,13,578,19114,35434,872,3495,389,11499,25481,323,1268,814,29243,311,279,4007,315,9958,627,
