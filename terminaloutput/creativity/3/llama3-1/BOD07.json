The speaker starts by pronouncing four words in different languages (Yalam, Gbg, Khung, and Twelfth) and claims that they have something important in common. She then goes on to explain what she does as a linguist, which is not just studying the meanings of words but rather the sounds of languages.\n\nShe compares linguists to mechanics who take apart engines to see how they work. She explains that each language is like a different car with its own unique engine (i.e., sound system). The speaker's area of specialization is phonology, which involves analyzing the internal workings of languages and how they relate to the human brain.\n\nShe mentions that languages have \"inventories\" or stores of important sounds in the brain, which can change depending on the language being spoken. For example, she notes that English has a different sound for \"U\" (like \"rue\") compared to French (which uses an \"OU\" sound like \"roue\"). This difference can make it difficult for speakers of one language to distinguish between similar-sounding words in another language.\n\nThe speaker concludes by noting that the four words she pronounced at the beginning all contain rare consonants, such as B, C, or B. She is working on a thesis to explain why certain languages have these rare consonants and not others. Her goal is to understand the connection between the sounds of our languages and what happens in our brains.\n\nThe overall tone of the speech is informal and conversational, with the speaker using analogies and metaphors to explain complex linguistic concepts. The audience appears to be other linguists or students of linguistics, as the speaker assumes some background knowledge of phonology and linguistic theory.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,816,17243,11,480,12498,11,20774,2234,11,12015,88798,13,11842,11,4864,841,36731,6502,6316,10896,5048,665,5542,409,20028,6316,1589,1082,11,4864,9189,36015,13,14465,3355,729,409,19126,263,3913,99309,78199,7010,99309,8859,1157,25945,96642,13,34447,27750,99309,78199,14848,79071,14896,409,25945,3062,665,34561,13,19421,41091,11,665,37622,1744,39603,17194,11,4864,52571,3869,60946,265,13,34447,9189,12584,89,757,7631,261,11,12769,61651,11,1208,39603,17194,11,294,3695,5392,788,11,1744,76605,13510,27750,99309,78199,45575,949,8345,19421,4864,91507,9189,13510,11,4864,841,63762,6502,13,4366,346,1744,41091,11,4864,841,36731,6502,6316,39603,17194,7617,1604,13,2998,5589,11,4864,841,36731,6502,71269,689,1001,33288,2536,5636,13,34447,41091,11,4864,308,57286,664,648,6502,3625,6225,951,78199,11,503,57286,664,648,3625,26419,951,8859,1157,13,34447,272,17771,75249,653,39603,17194,949,80905,294,6,370,541,11,653,39603,17194,841,1370,273,6502,52842,42625,51854,8859,1157,13,1952,308,17771,6502,78422,648,665,1099,13400,556,11,13080,665,30299,540,4714,383,13,1252,39603,17194,1826,26077,447,22827,7930,61735,19227,1001,3625,8859,1157,11,934,35329,76605,3625,59148,716,665,11990,409,4411,346,12249,1880,4043,1155,409,3625,51010,36501,5019,46131,4068,84568,34501,77,306,13,1952,1826,653,28800,22299,3625,32118,4919,3457,729,13,1952,61735,5945,72905,514,2107,354,5019,20028,57625,15610,7010,3625,88486,1759,951,8859,1157,13,19421,3846,7930,1826,27584,5636,78422,532,11,272,17771,1744,46777,96282,1826,22299,6316,81645,51199,68,13,2009,55467,11,22299,74637,9952,4538,88486,324,7930,436,263,2298,818,13,19421,326,6,124524,2852,11,7930,1826,653,28800,22299,514,12015,29008,934,54386,4160,275,961,412,1880,7930,20272,71151,951,1437,12059,293,11403,417,13,426,1116,11,3846,7930,296,55624,978,22550,11,272,17771,1120,1133,514,1437,3159,409,88486,324,13,4366,346,1744,39043,17317,665,22011,48488,1765,4068,34501,77,306,3625,88486,1759,84440,1474,5615,9004,13,19421,7010,1647,96839,11,1208,51923,38469,11,389,1239,42441,32592,12155,2047,417,2107,2469,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,514,272,5976,2933,13,1952,42775,273,9952,3846,934,54386,917,6853,951,17459,17724,13,356,17771,22299,951,5708,1154,409,26419,1179,1821,7010,46777,96282,1744,9189,47592,4685,8047,7010,514,272,5976,2933,13,34447,27750,5708,1154,2609,306,9952,46777,96282,1744,9189,1370,41881,13,4366,51173,11,7010,7643,96282,308,460,273,11,3846,7930,1826,326,6,124524,2852,11,389,308,26248,6502,514,4538,549,22299,56949,13,1952,308,26248,1744,514,4538,63935,22299,29465,68,13,19421,3930,16081,11,3625,6590,385,17144,14848,3930,8811,9465,27750,26633,26419,549,1880,549,13,34447,46152,834,306,1744,3846,308,17771,6502,25945,3062,1208,44178,16271,9465,549,1880,549,13,62463,26419,513,594,28111,306,19227,1001,13,1952,17317,60946,42676,389,1370,273,55467,11,259,52152,47391,66522,13,34447,272,17771,42676,27584,1208,44178,16271,9465,72006,16081,1880,72006,11957,13,1708,1105,11,14707,89504,6316,96282,308,26248,55455,3869,46131,9952,653,7970,30200,22299,389,9189,917,9484,3869,326,31769,56745,13,356,17771,76776,74282,66014,1880,44178,63934,1291,9465,3625,26419,1179,1821,7010,3625,5708,1154,294,31109,96282,11,3869,326,49455,265,13,1708,1105,11,19443,2439,3869,27750,99309,78199,3930,65385,13,3489,17771,54312,934,85217,14848,665,34561,949,2998,20272,11,46152,687,72,89810,45889,12,8699,951,78605,4978,3625,5636,436,5518,3930,38900,11,22299,426,11,356,6033,426,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,11,389,38831,83384,25945,28800,409,4160,42204,39723,514,88486,324,20272,653,409,27750,99309,1437,12059,2922,6496,13,19421,41091,11,7010,7643,270,4558,325,11,503,6,26577,648,294,6,30992,72684,87320,3738,288,8859,1157,687,72,89810,27750,78605,4978,436,5518,11,10071,6502,294,81979,13,4366,346,934,35329,379,264,653,55520,3062,9465,3625,26419,409,12155,8859,1157,1880,3846,7930,513,39904,7010,12155,272,5976,12249,13,19421,1208,51923,38469,17317,29557,409,5363,261,32592,514,2107,354,409,12155,8859,1157,1880,409,17317,1474,5615,9004,13,14465,9189,312,1195,25134,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2028,374,264,36815,315,264,8982,555,264,39603,380,11,4461,505,264,10017,477,15864,13,578,19114,8638,555,19126,37857,3116,4339,304,2204,15823,320,56,17243,11,480,12498,11,20774,2234,11,323,12015,88798,8,323,8349,430,814,617,2555,3062,304,4279,13,3005,1243,5900,389,311,10552,1148,1364,1587,439,264,39603,380,11,902,374,539,1120,21630,279,50800,315,4339,719,4856,279,10578,315,15823,627,198,8100,43565,39603,1705,311,30126,889,1935,10980,21787,311,1518,1268,814,990,13,3005,15100,430,1855,4221,374,1093,264,2204,1841,449,1202,1866,5016,4817,320,72,13,68,2637,5222,1887,570,578,19114,596,3158,315,66979,374,51923,2508,11,902,18065,42118,279,5419,79236,315,15823,323,1268,814,29243,311,279,3823,8271,627,198,8100,34945,430,15823,617,330,258,688,2490,1,477,10756,315,3062,10578,304,279,8271,11,902,649,2349,11911,389,279,4221,1694,22066,13,1789,3187,11,1364,8554,430,6498,7
