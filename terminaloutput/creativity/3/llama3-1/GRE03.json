Here's a summary of the text:\n\nThe speaker, a psychologist, imagines a parallel universe where everyone has personal assistants, bodyguards, stylists, chefs who cook their favorite meals, and friendly bankers who finance their wildest projects. This universe is called \"childhood\" and these extraordinary individuals are referred to as \"parents\". The speaker notes that psychologists have long attributed the world's problems to parents, but few experts consider how parents themselves live with their parental role.\n\nThe speaker highlights the cultural expectation that parenting should always be a positive experience, with young parents receiving congratulations and gifts. However, this is not always the case. Parenting can be exhausting, leading many mothers and fathers to feel unaccompanied and burnt out.\n\nResearch shows that burnout can have severe consequences for families, including conflicts, violence, neglect, and abuse. The speaker's role as a psychologist is to predict and prevent parental burnout by providing support and resources. A program has been designed to help parents regain serenity, choice, and satisfaction through workshops that teach stress management, mindfulness, and emotional regulation techniques.\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention, the speaker collects small hair samples from participants before and after the program to measure cortisol levels, a marker of chronic stress, and quantify improvements in their overall well-being. The speaker concludes by emphasizing the need for solutions-focused research and interventions that support parents in their role.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,38891,89,653,11159,1370,543,51453,7010,514,43014,9189,26725,28490,89,294,22827,74817,12844,6223,978,11,294,22827,22641,3675,3930,34922,11,294,22827,18078,65746,11,294,22827,31547,258,1291,7930,27389,3462,5019,9189,26725,26317,628,1900,27389,69,14081,5512,1880,294,22827,9120,33571,22176,64,7930,17452,26317,22040,1441,3625,5636,282,788,1880,7930,513,27389,14310,86577,1744,9189,779,9188,89,44093,77818,2249,13,356,295,11159,11,76190,2439,31307,326,41901,69,685,13,19421,40744,27750,48577,64555,17724,11,76190,2439,12,645,6699,13,4241,9425,951,35881,2734,552,11,3625,8841,1640,1157,14848,84788,72,3869,17780,8977,1208,4294,87782,409,16968,514,8811,383,324,3930,38900,10253,6699,13,356,13059,519,11,25945,28800,409,76305,75460,274,55624,978,676,306,3869,4068,3625,6699,11,84440,11,18434,306,28130,46679,13109,13,46706,29449,7829,11,3900,379,264,6316,1651,6960,5019,1744,1208,46679,13109,45441,44093,13,39783,88411,6928,13,11876,60120,6699,312,20822,81541,951,503,337,552,7558,288,11,951,58482,6154,811,1880,84871,409,86696,78418,12249,296,625,2439,13,11876,60404,15132,16265,8839,11,39587,3625,6699,3567,969,1188,23761,3625,5636,77818,2249,3930,38900,13,356,8458,1826,83195,11,10071,6502,16968,514,27138,13,2998,59157,13109,11,23761,2748,11,39043,36709,13,64105,64,36709,3869,19227,1486,1744,409,5636,665,5636,409,33820,598,1880,409,26365,300,308,6,1138,81541,5636,3869,513,75802,88778,5512,13,81245,274,31769,652,285,306,13,5034,38317,20605,265,27584,934,85217,274,31769,652,285,306,5636,1744,3625,53542,294,82405,17724,13,41621,62299,6350,285,949,9424,688,11,3625,6699,84440,1474,5615,9004,841,11427,306,6502,934,85217,5945,544,8135,409,8395,9994,46679,13,11876,1615,978,45045,409,8395,9994,46679,15132,25945,19266,85,31539,13,12623,409,83977,1220,11,5636,409,4738,2436,11,5636,409,38605,6200,343,2436,1880,409,8811,30532,3095,13,350,519,5019,326,41901,61827,11,3625,21961,11,3625,2138,31355,1218,59307,13,3206,436,57332,665,37622,1744,8841,77828,6824,68,3869,550,15433,556,13,19421,3869,27389,43406,326,53149,9425,1133,951,6699,13,62293,11083,4631,4558,70,1157,11,17317,57038,390,79884,653,18629,409,27389,7611,7930,348,1082,3869,2579,263,1215,10253,6699,409,1208,274,14081,10610,13109,11,3930,60020,11,409,1208,24617,13,33150,45369,294,6,84426,4918,11,503,6,57379,3625,6699,3869,917,9484,265,951,12823,409,59471,3930,8631,11,409,7245,483,42563,11,409,59471,951,4046,76,41356,61907,3742,13,34447,4068,47929,1744,1647,21623,1826,31914,580,949,61651,14707,11,4864,57625,4618,7010,1208,83067,951,6699,13,41621,5019,7379,89,9189,13510,11,12769,11876,8841,1640,1157,11,39587,11,272,17771,4725,13,8345,34447,4864,1239,42441,28463,43153,3091,588,2249,13,27058,4046,838,8977,326,6,6581,292,582,13109,409,20662,21623,11,4864,28130,550,19010,79351,951,98385,296,4558,8696,409,3091,588,2249,33670,1880,3869,1208,1913,3930,18629,5019,93455,514,9637,2249,409,89942,2107,6374,556,11,75467,324,3930,8631,27076,2428,11,1880,10484,3125,326,58591,73511,7769,409,28130,14240,266,409,77323,1880,409,14707,85815,13,1952,308,53149,9484,6502,3869,326,31769,56745,3869,23761,653,7970,2748,13,24703,87264,951,14707,21965,1317,1157,14240,29246,11,25692,85815,27584,4225,258,552,13,356,17771,87320,7010,11083,58673,2249,11,503,6,434,61055,409,46524,951,10105,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5992,1093,499,617,264,36815,315,264,8982,477,15864,922,279,12939,315,12899,6699,304,872,3560,323,27252,46679,8395,412,13,5810,596,264,12399,315,279,1495,512,198,791,19114,11,264,54595,11,6669,1572,264,15638,15861,1405,5127,706,4443,57619,11,2547,79838,11,18078,18035,11,60227,889,4394,872,7075,21644,11,323,11919,64243,889,17452,872,31331,5086,7224,13,1115,15861,374,2663,330,3124,5812,1,323,1521,24674,7931,527,14183,311,439,330,26534,3343,578,19114,8554,430,74191,617,1317,30706,279,1917,596,5435,311,6699,11,719,2478,11909,2980,1268,6699,5694,3974,449,872,46679,3560,627,198,791,19114,22020,279,13042,31293,430,49058,1288,2744,387,264,6928,3217,11,449,3995,6699,12588,82644,323,21258,13,4452,11,420,374,539,2744,279,1162,13,17457,287,649,387,79953,11,6522,1690,27698,323,40317,311,2733,653,73087,22840,323,50440,704,627,198,28528,5039,430,8395,412,649,617,15748,16296,369,8689,11,2737,26885,11,9349,11,39332,11,323,11737,13,578,19114,596,3560,439,264,54595,374,311,7168,323,5471,46679,8395,412,555,8405,1862,323,5070,13,362,2068,706,1027,6319,311,1520,6699,49655,1446,56685,11,5873,11,323,24617,1555,35936,430,4639,8631,6373,11,71705,11,323,14604,19812,12823,627,198,1271,15806,279,27375,315,420,21623,11,279,19114,52307,2678,7013,10688,505,13324,1603,323,1306,279,2068,311,6767,89942,5990,11,264,11381,315,21249,8631,11,323,76498,18637,304,872,8244,1664,33851,13,578,19114,45537,555,82003,279,1205,369,10105,52373,3495,323,39455,430,1862,6699,304,872,3560,13,128009],"total_duration":10621112945,"load_duration":478475,"prompt_eval_count":672,"prompt_eval_duration":1258171000,"eval_count":309,"eval_duration":9
