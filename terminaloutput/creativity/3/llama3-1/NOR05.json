It's amazing that most people here have a microwave oven to heat their food, but they never thought of using the same microwave oven to make the fuel for their car. And that's the goal of my thesis, to use a microwave cavity to make an ecological fuel. Well, I know you're wondering how it works, what I do in my lab. Okay, imagine you're at home and you take a cold baguette, a bread baguette, cold and put it in the microwave. If you leave it for too long, it will be burned and your kitchen will be filled with smoke. In my case, I don't have smoke in my lab or kitchen. I take that smoke, condense it, and get a liquid fuel. So, don't worry, I won't let France go dark. I'm forced to take another material more ecological, representing the 80% of renewable energy in Europe. This material is called biomass. Biomass is all organic matter of vegetable or animal origin that can be transformed into energy. For example, your waste, surplus from agriculture and also wood.\n\n**The goal**\n\nThis is where it starts. This is where my thesis question begins. How can I use this biomass to make an ecological fuel? Well, to achieve this, I'm using a process called pyrolysis. Pyrolysis is the thermal degradation of a material in an oxygen-free atmosphere to produce charcoal, non-condensable gases and also a liquid, combustible oil.\n\n**The challenge**\n\nNow, there's another question. How can we use this biomass to make an ecological fuel? How am I going to heat the biomass with microwaves to make the fuel? Well, it's important to know that in a microwave cavity, there are electromagnetic probes traveling and coming into contact with the biomass. As these particles start moving, they cause friction inside the biomass, like all revolutions. But this friction takes place at the production of charcoal. And that's where the biomass develops. It's one of the first things we've done. There's a slight reduction in heat and thus the thermal degradation that produces the fuel. And that's where the difficulty of my thesis lies. Because I need to find ways to improve the absorption and contact of these electromagnetic probes, to improve heating of the biomass and thus its degradation, the production of fuel.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nI'm sure that in the future, my thesis will help you make your own ecological fuel at home with your microwave oven. Thank you very much.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,13789,708,404,13,356,17771,4046,783,52985,1744,1208,628,455,472,951,48577,49733,30179,21938,14848,653,8162,12,2159,288,5019,13826,2084,28130,46798,1018,554,10071,841,513,15132,56316,43306,978,294,49963,12329,514,27584,8162,12,2159,288,5019,20028,514,44545,1260,409,28130,81645,13,19421,39015,11,272,17771,514,719,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,294,49963,12329,653,57709,13109,3869,8162,12,2159,288,5019,20028,653,44545,1260,91329,1640,2428,13,13789,11,4864,63762,1744,9189,9189,7631,10333,4068,39043,15572,68,11,3846,1744,4864,66517,7010,1647,10278,78,13,7777,11,13085,89,1744,9189,62299,46206,9189,1880,9189,864,55506,6316,9145,84,6672,43905,13091,579,11,6316,9145,84,6672,409,6784,11,43905,13091,579,1880,9189,1208,2322,668,89,7010,514,8162,12,2159,288,13,12095,9189,93569,89,1208,9145,84,6672,42844,21965,409,27138,11,27549,11412,23761,1437,30872,75,8047,1880,15265,36105,35737,7245,483,409,282,372,8047,13,46706,1647,4865,11,4864,326,34155,6502,1208,282,372,8047,7010,1647,10278,78,6033,7010,7643,36105,13,14465,35456,82,20662,282,372,8047,11,4864,1208,9955,1137,1880,503,6,677,10462,729,653,12046,579,44545,1260,13,1708,1105,11,841,9189,304,47391,978,668,89,6502,11,4864,841,91507,6502,1208,74333,1208,9822,665,3703,65220,13,14465,36731,12611,8047,409,59394,653,47838,5634,28154,2933,5636,91329,1640,2428,11,653,5634,28154,2933,7930,71925,6960,3625,220,1490,48577,409,326,31769,64374,5790,283,899,481,665,4606,13,24703,5634,28154,2933,274,53149,6853,1208,39538,13559,13,5034,39538,13559,11,272,17771,43905,5634,20712,2942,2428,294,6,4775,483,348,19395,10515,1604,6033,4039,1604,7930,25692,23761,5276,8047,665,4046,64374,13,4366,51173,11,26317,7591,331,1441,11,514,41548,409,326,6,351,2265,10745,1880,28463,3625,66304,13,19421,272,17771,39015,1744,39043,56445,13,356,17771,39015,1744,513,78422,12339,1208,55133,3488,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,12535,44829,12,3841,75144,20662,39538,13559,1880,20028,653,44545,1260,91329,1640,2428,949,13789,11,5019,45602,11,4864,757,274,388,294,22827,13988,15433,978,7930,274,53149,6853,1208,4611,299,398,325,13,5034,4611,299,398,325,11,272,17771,1208,7591,49241,30945,2428,294,22827,5634,28154,2933,7010,6316,14036,764,12339,15878,99690,70,48099,5019,39929,22299,54206,3930,1181,6098,11,951,56086,2536,9955,729,4893,1880,28463,653,12046,579,11,34065,458,11,44545,1260,13,19421,74699,11,3900,379,264,6316,26633,90272,3488,13,12535,25692,10539,75144,20662,39538,13559,5019,20028,653,44545,1260,91329,1640,2428,949,12535,1826,54312,1744,4864,91507,13826,2084,1208,39538,13559,9952,951,8162,12,2159,288,5019,20028,514,44545,1260,949,13789,11,3900,47090,47929,1744,7010,653,57709,13109,409,8162,12,2159,288,11,3900,379,264,951,47937,288,98151,442,3326,10515,8467,665,5542,409,23933,1435,13,19421,7930,1218,8135,665,3729,9952,1208,39538,13559,11,39043,20272,1744,3625,2598,2482,1081,27462,3869,30870,1414,13,13789,11,22299,27750,2598,2482,2922,6496,841,56311,6502,30870,1414,22299,389,76605,11,39043,5353,6316,39676,3869,326,55624,57663,409,1208,39538,13559,11,22299,40744,3625,9517,12821,4065,13,34447,20662,39676,264,39381,3869,1208,5788,409,1181,6098,13,19421,272,17771,39015,1744,513,52895,375,1208,39538,13559,13,19421,272,17771,6316,951,6954,59307,79165,1744,17317,57038,20272,13,356,17771,6316,55133,14896,1744,17317,57038,20272,13,7695,379,264,6316,38920,9517,23985,409,1208,523,61047,1880,44351,1208,7591,49241,30945,2428,7930,54206,514,44545,1260,13,19421,39015,513,71451,1208,5107,978,409,4242,4558,325,13,4366,346,1744,41091,11,3900,47090,1744,4864,71451,951,52138,729,5019,1097,73511,15171,326,6,3518,66181,1880,514,3729,409,27750,47937,288,98151,442,3326,10515,8467,11,5019,1097,73511,15171,514,74817,425,409,1208,39538,13559,1880,44351,829,7591,49241,11,514,74817,425,409,1208,39538,13559,1880,44351,1208,5788,409,44545,1260,13,13789,11,4864,36731,78705,265,1744,7010,514,18111,324,11,4242,4558,325,9189,91878,64,3869,20028,15265,83187,44545,1260,91329,1640,2428,13,46206,9189,9952,15265,3116,8065,8162,12,2159,288,13,25145,72,48488,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,8586,374,279,36815,449,279,1495,25548,1139,6498,1473,9,9,52398,334,198,198,15571,11714,13,1102,596,8056,430,1455,1274,1618,617,264,42374,24276,311,8798,872,3691,11,719,814,2646,3463,315,1701,279,1890,42374,24276,311,1304,279,10633,369,872,1841,13,1628,430,596,279,5915,315,856,17850,11,311,1005,264,42374,56429,311,1304,459,50953,10633,13,8489,11,358,1440,499,2351,20910,1268,433,4375,11,1148,358,656,304,856,10278,13,36539,11,13085,499,2351,520,2162,323,499,1935,264,9439,9145,84,6672,11,264,16385,9145,84,6672,11,9439,323,2231,433,304,279,42374,13,1442,499,5387,433,369,2288,1317,11,433,690,387,27724,323,701,9979,690,387,10409,449,16603,13,763,856,1162,11,358,1541,956,617,16603,304,856,10278,477,9979,13,358,1935,430,16603,11,9955,1137,433,11,323,636,264,14812,10633,13,2100,11,1541,956,11196,11,358,2834,956,1095,9822,733,6453,13,358,2846,9770,311,1935,2500,3769,810,50953,11,1
