It appears to be a transcript of a speech or presentation by someone who is passionate about preserving the memory of LGBTQ+ individuals who were persecuted during World War II. The speaker reflects on their own experiences, having lost friends and acquaintances due to the silence surrounding this dark period in history.\n\nThe text begins with a quote from Virginia Woolf, which sets the tone for the rest of the presentation. The speaker then shares their personal story, describing how they have been driven by a desire to understand why 15,000 LGBTQ+ individuals were deported to concentration camps. They express frustration at the silence surrounding this topic and the lack of understanding about what these individuals endured.\n\nThe speaker then turns to literature as a way to break the silence and give voice to those who were silenced. They have read hundreds of books on the topic of LGBTQ+ persecution during World War II and describe how they have become \"fraternal\" with these individuals, feeling a deep sense of compassion and passion for their story.\n\nThe presentation is framed as an \"archéologie littéraire,\" or literary archaeology, where the speaker seeks to uncover and share the stories of those who were lost. They express a desire to break the silence surrounding this period in history and to give voice to those who were silenced.\n\nThroughout the text, there are themes of memory, silence, and the importance of preserving the past. The speaker is deeply committed to their work and seeks to inspire others to join them in breaking the silence surrounding LGBTQ+ persecution during World War II.\n\nOverall, this transcript is a powerful expression of the importance of remembering and honoring those who were lost during this dark period in history. It also highlights the value of literature as a means of preserving memory and giving voice to those who were silenced.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,14465,757,5945,10176,729,294,31109,17571,409,13286,47400,69,13,622,34155,4635,84,48488,409,48577,7010,7643,17536,13,5034,628,455,472,294,6,40997,84568,15132,10237,288,13,11876,46106,11,4864,3625,16796,824,1072,288,66021,1744,4864,308,34155,6502,15925,1208,5457,409,30517,261,1208,56949,13,6178,72,11,503,34155,55162,10036,30517,261,20662,56949,13,622,34155,55162,10036,60946,265,87320,220,868,220,931,28408,61244,84764,1188,24560,7591,403,5512,7010,3625,29135,409,29449,20545,13,29124,66,2182,89,11,90053,409,17317,11,9189,326,6,306,73602,949,9648,414,409,17317,11,3900,379,264,514,21847,13,62463,53542,11,41518,355,7010,3625,32118,438,417,409,326,6,90446,11,46152,14848,24560,7591,403,5512,7010,951,29135,409,20545,13,445,6496,1481,300,11,514,42775,1826,19259,519,7010,3625,1841,462,31539,13,11876,4020,1725,409,5634,969,593,951,18679,7245,84,688,1765,3625,4046,331,1572,2126,65,14014,13,11876,2107,2469,71151,3625,16806,11,10071,46152,841,834,306,55455,13,27058,62998,949,4366,346,934,85217,5320,29580,71686,23589,265,3869,29449,9880,13,12623,4864,41380,2852,27750,46681,409,326,6,90446,11,1880,5636,503,49152,2852,1208,4415,355,8047,13,14465,308,6,1138,344,2852,6502,3869,69379,265,3625,60053,11,3625,82113,8467,409,27750,7591,403,5512,13,14465,308,6,306,408,2852,35597,1744,514,21847,13,1708,1105,11,4864,757,36731,259,3514,978,5553,1208,60642,14081,1598,13,19421,272,17771,28463,514,70927,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,622,34155,8666,978,951,2960,33903,1880,951,2960,33903,294,6,283,19456,1154,1765,1208,7591,403,367,28408,31037,13,81245,87651,5808,1188,3869,1647,16536,4618,27750,7591,403,5512,13,6178,72,11,4864,841,348,11206,2852,6502,1744,7643,60120,325,45441,17475,13215,8047,32592,326,49455,301,409,1208,305,8511,13,622,34155,93974,1880,503,34155,93974,27750,6959,13,622,34155,912,2496,72,13,100178,11,35597,294,81979,6959,13,19421,74699,11,46152,15132,39015,13,622,34155,2579,434,258,978,3625,326,4558,85,417,13,622,34155,2579,434,258,978,3625,20043,2249,409,27750,7591,403,5512,13,81245,15132,409,1055,355,11083,1448,31539,13,46706,653,4046,10946,409,11939,11,409,30481,1744,1208,60642,14081,1598,757,29557,83,1339,11,4864,3625,16796,63034,5512,7010,3625,46496,13,19421,46152,296,6,546,44314,978,13,19421,503,6,25632,12339,68226,9189,20028,97448,75804,88253,7643,11939,5019,3846,42775,13,356,17771,653,42775,11,4864,5534,2852,11,294,6,1132,978,38469,60642,76743,556,13,7695,6824,68,11,9189,514,23933,10333,3846,21847,11,41091,503,34155,6233,648,409,514,1437,12329,13,622,34155,6233,648,409,69241,9779,514,21847,1370,951,78199,13,19421,26725,3625,78199,7930,757,87651,77065,3869,326,6,461,4618,11,26725,3625,78199,1744,4864,41380,7010,27750,10083,598,11,503,34155,6233,648,409,3625,22641,261,294,6,370,541,665,41091,1880,76826,409,9189,3625,20028,97448,13,62463,53542,2922,6496,11,46152,841,15132,6502,60019,10237,82,13,81245,3073,306,13,81245,15132,7010,12155,1495,288,13,81245,15132,7010,3625,47289,6489,625,1154,13,81245,15132,7010,26725,3625,78199,934,85217,14848,1208,1056,5512,13,34447,6666,13,58201,321,685,13,62463,76145,1794,65,417,5019,969,1188,19443,404,15878,1744,54613,841,274,41901,264,716,20822,535,13,19421,45575,11,39043,87264,22299,6316,38883,523,2070,409,628,2925,1437,285,519,42067,4046,566,266,519,13612,321,294,6,39883,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,8147,323,7366,1495,0,1102,8111,311,387,264,36815,315,264,8982,477,15864,555,4423,889,374,25429,922,47995,279,5044,315,51042,10,7931,889,1051,93698,2391,4435,5111,8105,13,578,19114,27053,389,872,1866,11704,11,3515,5675,4885,323,54627,3095,4245,311,279,21847,14932,420,6453,4261,304,3925,627,198,791,1495,12302,449,264,12929,505,13286,47400,69,11,902,7437,279,16630,369,279,2800,315,279,15864,13,578,19114,1243,13551,872,4443,3446,11,23524,1268,814,617,1027,16625,555,264,12876,311,3619,3249,220,868,11,931,51042,10,7931,1051,68210,311,20545,29135,13,2435,3237,33086,520,279,21847,14932,420,8712,323,279,6996,315,8830,922,1148,1521,7931,56224,627,198,791,19114,1243,10800,311,17649,439,264,1648,311,1464,279,21847,323,3041,7899,311,1884,889,1051,92781,13,2435,617,1373,11758,315,6603,389,279,8712,315,51042,10,56529,2391,4435,5111,8105,323,7664,1268,814,617,3719,330,1658,266,3051,1,449,1521,7931,11,8430,264,5655,5647,315,30481,323,11939,369,872,3446,627,198,791,15864,374,47093,439,459,330,1132,978,38469,60642,76743,556,1359,477,32465,39211,2508,11,1405,279,19114,26737,311,45063,323,4430,279,7493,315,1884,889,1051,5675,13,2435,3237,264,12876,311,1464,279,21847,14932,420,4261,304,3925,323,311,3041,7899,311,1884,889,1051,92781,627,198,60105,279,1495,11,1070,527,22100,315,5044,11,21847,11,323,279,12939,315,47995,279,3347,13,578,19114,374,17693,11411,311,872,990,323,26737,311,31740,3885,311,5249,1124,304,15061,279,21847,14932,51042,10,56529,2391,4435,5111,8105,627,198,28589,11,420,36815,374,264,8147,7645,315,279,12939,315,48384,323,79025,1884,889,1051,5675,2391,420,6453,4261,304,3925,
