The speaker, a researcher, starts by asking how babies are formed from a single cell and goes on to discuss the importance of understanding the process of neural development.\n\nThe speaker explains that they have been studying the zebrafish embryo, which allows them to observe the early stages of brain development. They show images of the embryo's head, which reveals the formation of the eyes and nose. The speaker notes that neurons in the olfactory bulb (the area responsible for processing smells) migrate away from the surface of the brain while extending their axons to connect with other cells.\n\nThe speaker then proposes two hypotheses: either there are people who have problems with their brains, or there are external forces that are guiding the neurons. They suggest that the cells in the eye may be pulling the neurons out of the olfactory bulb and guiding them to connect with the brain. To test this idea, they examined embryos with a genetic mutation that prevents eye formation and found that the neurons do not migrate properly without eyes.\n\nThe speaker concludes that their research shows that mechanical forces play an important role in neural development and that understanding these forces can provide new insights into neurological disorders. They end by saying \"may the force be with your neurons!\"","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,46706,1647,9511,67763,11,389,513,17477,6316,3488,79380,4382,11,1880,1744,9189,47592,78705,55755,46939,1153,8047,11,7930,1826,11,4068,389,20272,3625,90551,65,5512,949,33150,48226,6496,409,1208,90509,653,28800,4046,78134,1744,3625,6699,3381,3869,43153,60404,11,17317,389,513,62163,60019,11,4068,11,3869,31632,294,31109,2849,1130,69483,1739,58482,1321,8047,11,389,17782,3869,20028,951,47120,288,1218,4918,11,259,2053,1744,9189,1880,41091,13,24703,7930,296,55624,978,22550,5636,54008,67882,8065,45369,3930,82620,44481,13767,556,11,3846,15132,3625,21850,3233,11,3625,2849,2482,7930,1380,4150,73468,326,6,26125,13,12535,513,2361,77,306,12,8839,8065,7970,842,69596,7010,326,6,8629,44618,11,1880,513,4667,306,12,8839,4495,1133,3625,7120,9952,3625,46106,11,5019,4846,951,46121,34501,36527,949,62463,4860,14848,46939,24560,14707,14240,21178,14014,294,22827,1486,409,48234,38094,2428,11,9952,1208,35881,15170,668,409,22337,20243,2482,7930,1709,1748,3625,21850,3233,11,10071,1208,77701,94943,409,1647,46494,1826,409,5363,261,514,436,57332,951,8603,32118,4919,8467,7010,1208,57459,665,2035,951,46121,21850,6863,2249,13,27058,45602,11,503,49963,1082,514,83597,3930,3273,49363,1167,4558,21152,11,22299,9189,45366,514,46131,49733,3869,96721,11,9952,951,5448,550,5014,11,45441,409,3663,11,45441,1765,514,81337,13,62463,5448,14848,24560,550,5014,3869,50026,653,9880,42138,1208,37194,68,11,1880,665,15932,519,1765,1208,83067,409,326,6,9034,894,263,11,9952,514,73757,11,22299,1765,326,78337,8065,12541,11,389,25692,46131,514,272,5976,2933,7930,513,52895,375,11,9952,409,46777,81337,3625,20043,2249,7930,513,369,479,11,1880,8065,89429,355,11,3625,37923,44669,1572,3930,3273,49363,13,46706,1208,44669,483,3930,3273,49363,1167,4558,21152,11,3625,21850,3233,29444,8135,665,274,31769,385,59110,409,1208,7479,3930,272,5976,2933,11,16968,665,682,647,68,519,2761,65220,84440,653,1317,46496,11,326,6,710,606,11,77433,8065,43014,46152,513,4667,306,9952,3625,2849,2482,3930,272,5976,2933,13,356,17771,326,78337,934,54386,25692,46131,3869,7118,635,13,11876,21850,3233,11,16968,22299,3625,46106,2849,2482,11,14848,951,32118,4919,2191,288,10805,1354,4558,14295,7930,28130,29557,73468,409,9971,261,1880,294,49152,11967,7010,28130,50026,40280,13,46706,514,4865,951,21850,3233,409,1208,44669,483,11,13051,11,27584,87158,27750,32118,4919,2191,288,10805,1354,4558,14295,841,34501,77,306,6502,11,3625,21850,3233,1860,1149,306,1880,14240,29293,28130,3944,606,5019,513,4667,261,9952,514,272,5976,2933,13,356,17771,653,28800,22299,4502,389,5363,1339,6316,81645,1765,653,25911,46089,11,15890,514,88486,324,1826,45324,978,1880,934,54386,1208,23933,1339,42676,27584,1860,11967,13,1952,25692,45575,23423,261,3869,26633,45455,4558,9459,11,45441,3900,379,264,951,47104,7930,14848,951,52088,66474,409,272,5976,2933,11,45441,3900,379,264,951,47104,7930,17258,784,306,1208,81645,11,45441,3900,379,264,951,47104,7930,1208,28387,406,13,356,17771,1208,27584,14896,5019,3625,21850,3233,409,1208,44669,483,13,1952,73953,1744,3846,15132,3625,2849,2482,409,326,6,52822,321,11,7930,513,10109,306,665,21273,788,11,7930,28387,406,3625,21850,3233,409,1208,44669,483,1765,514,81337,11,83786,25108,52985,326,65948,647,1133,409,28130,3944,606,11,77433,8065,43014,46152,513,4667,306,9952,514,272,5976,2933,13,27058,77680,3125,20662,887,8047,11,503,34155,5363,978,951,44481,2439,7930,14848,6316,27472,78422,99188,1880,7930,841,369,479,6502,294,6,52822,321,13,622,34155,33614,1744,1765,27750,44481,2439,11,3625,21850,3233,409,1208,44669,483,308,49152,1149,306,6502,13,62463,100246,3355,89810,2389,404,1195,29449,45455,4558,325,11,65735,1208,88265,3625,21850,3233,409,1208,44669,483,11,15132,5636,6033,40970,3608,8467,11,1880,39587,11,46152,841,34501,77,306,6502,13,356,17771,6316,98652,65735,1208,88265,3625,2849,2482,409,326,6,52822,321,28387,406,3625,21850,3233,409,1208,44669,483,11,1880,20605,265,934,35329,308,59858,264,6502,1744,3625,22337,20243,2482,38094,8467,7930,15132,75419,8065,45369,3930,82620,11,10071,28463,3625,8603,32118,4919,8467,13,33150,48226,6496,409,1208,44669,483,3930,3273,49363,1167,4558,21152,11,64972,60946,265,514,436,57332,951,8603,32118,4919,8467,8065,45369,3930,82620,1469,403,2473,653,35462,4046,49272,425,1765,3625,8811,17491,3930,72601,32015,2249,13,1708,1105,11,1744,1208,5457,45441,9952,26317,21850,3233,758,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,791,1495,374,264,36815,315,264,15864,477,31678,922,279,4500,315,89873,323,279,3560,315,22936,8603,304,279,18488,315,30828,46121,13,578,19114,11,264,32185,11,8638,555,10371,1268,24869,527,14454,505,264,3254,2849,323,5900,389,311,4358,279,12939,315,8830,279,1920,315,30828,4500,627,198,791,19114,15100,430,814,617,1027,21630,279,1167,3141,15817,819,87701,11,902,6276,1124,311,23846,279,4216,18094,315,8271,4500,13,2435,1501,5448,315,279,87701,596,2010,11,902,21667,279,18488,315,279,6548,323,19689,13,578,19114,8554,430,34313,304,279,8492,22348,46912,320,1820,3158,8647,369,8863
