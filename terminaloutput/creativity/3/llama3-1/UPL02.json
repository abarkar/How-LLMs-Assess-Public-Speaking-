{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-11-19T13:41:32.570316071Z","response":"The text appears to be a spoken word piece or a lecture transcript about the topic of philosophical education with children. The speaker, who is likely an educator or researcher in the field of education and human rights, shares her personal experience of being asked by her 5-year-old niece Jeanne where she was before she was born. This question prompts the speaker to reflect on the importance of philosophical education with children.\n\nThe speaker mentions that she discovered the practice of philosophy with children through the work of philosopher Mathieu Lippmann in the 1970s, and notes that this approach is recognized internationally as a way to consider children not just as vulnerable beings but as capable thinkers. The speaker also references the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989) which considers children as subjects with rights.\n\nThe main focus of the piece appears to be on exploring how philosophical education can be used to promote human rights and universal values, particularly in light of criticisms that human rights are often Western-centric. The speaker hypothesizes that a more horizontal approach to pedagogy, such as philosophy with children, could help ensure intercultural understanding and promote a constructed universal.\n\nThroughout the text, the speaker uses personal anecdotes and references to support her arguments, and appears to be reflecting on her own experiences and observations in order to test her hypothesis. The piece concludes by hinting that the speaker is planning to conduct further research on this topic, specifically through pilot projects with children.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,88245,11,503,31769,2629,285,39723,33670,409,4415,66014,949,64105,64,11,272,17771,1208,3488,1744,7643,13080,4558,346,20263,818,296,26248,1153,8047,3869,220,20,8261,13,1708,1105,3154,519,9189,13510,1744,4864,841,11427,2852,6502,21965,75249,75871,265,13,29124,66,2182,20263,818,11,9964,72567,300,39043,42676,9964,1446,300,5636,25626,11,294,69537,541,949,74656,97717,11,27549,43989,7591,3209,361,409,7643,90509,13,14465,1208,60946,82,13,11842,10071,272,17771,83195,11,272,17771,57625,39043,13,350,788,27750,60404,7930,17317,1153,306,951,4860,3073,306,13327,645,11,1880,17317,7930,74533,39015,3869,293,19395,1155,11,4864,36731,78705,265,1744,39043,9189,1826,46939,69003,978,13,2998,16968,4865,11,41091,39043,296,26248,10805,27843,8047,13,19421,272,17771,22299,39043,1744,503,34155,59148,1653,1208,95234,409,1208,13868,648,9952,3625,60404,13,452,8047,32592,326,6,8039,580,3930,10891,437,81509,4242,26235,445,2877,18022,7010,3625,65838,220,2031,13,39783,95234,7930,274,17771,68866,8047,409,961,412,7010,514,38900,13,19421,4864,757,36731,22011,11,55475,9952,3625,60404,11,272,17771,3625,77554,52424,2536,6502,71686,22299,951,86696,20183,45632,3869,1760,978,1414,11,10071,22299,409,45165,1018,4893,924,75004,7930,56311,23423,261,1370,84440,1474,5615,9004,13,2582,11,389,38831,83384,20662,43656,7010,1208,26958,2655,38135,951,97222,409,326,41901,61827,409,220,3753,24,11,7930,77554,12339,326,41901,61827,22299,653,45165,23349,70927,409,64079,13,19421,326,6,12210,13109,11,19189,65699,62891,11,841,17317,282,2473,6502,13510,514,32150,556,13,1708,1105,11,16968,39043,11,41091,39043,296,55624,978,22550,66021,1744,503,57286,664,648,514,64079,3869,326,31769,34985,11,1880,5636,51625,285,42625,326,31769,34985,10253,97222,2854,1771,13,1708,1105,11,3625,19687,1252,552,14848,5906,665,2035,41199,220,1049,19,11,653,18629,62940,532,294,31769,34985,10253,97222,409,326,6,87713,11,15890,1208,55133,10474,60172,1765,326,6,1137,625,1133,36413,556,1880,2132,12267,13,34447,45575,11,4068,48021,665,99225,61480,653,19227,18629,949,7695,47090,100243,479,9517,1517,978,331,404,10253,13531,35933,281,15433,55180,8467,13,9589,54312,1744,9189,3567,39395,39723,4864,5320,2249,665,96586,949,9589,54312,1744,1208,95234,409,1208,13868,648,9952,3625,60404,841,92215,6502,23761,653,23464,1291,5019,6316,94721,86740,409,43153,97222,949,1708,1105,11,4864,841,63762,6502,13,1708,1105,11,5019,38211,20662,45455,4558,325,11,4864,91507,1765,514,25911,13,1219,2727,514,46110,1732,68155,11,39015,11,4864,757,36731,1376,8047,3869,459,3212,951,520,301,4918,409,13868,648,9952,3625,60404,11,5019,20028,665,80444,1744,3625,60404,841,834,306,6502,3846,934,85217,23423,306,11,10071,934,85217,23423,306,3846,934,85217,834,306,11,3625,1097,804,3869,6316,3738,68,74772,768,13868,2428,13,3206,1665,333,11,272,17771,409,75831,653,1760,511,1286,281,15433,55180,2428,7930,43678,1339,76076,9908,409,1208,26958,2655,38135,951,97222,409,326,41901,61827,665,409,45165,1018,4893,520,301,4918,409,13868,648,11,5019,76826,11083,7889,6033,2536,1208,18713,258,768,294,22827,19227,1760,511,1286,13,34447,3900,379,264,653,10071,13,3489,17771,54312,1744,39043,1879,57609,11,6316,4046,34985,11159,6853,10253,97222,409,326,6,87713,949,14465,841,36731,6502,15878,47929,934,35329,29253,6316,65058,43665,3930,57705,12339,3056,1748,12812,21911,43711,409,1208,8246,27584,409,27750,97222,13,19421,20662,43665,841,296,48099,6502,1744,951,38682,1769,42284,83391,13,1708,1105,11,4068,326,31769,34985,10253,97222,2854,1771,25692,12,6853,75871,265,3869,27750,665,3841,2249,11,40192,404,514,39598,44618,7829,75,949,14465,66517,326,39982,1100,8942,4558,325,1744,1370,1208,95234,409,1208,13868,648,9952,3625,60404,11,7930,1826,6316,281,15433,55180,648,5636,4917,6317,1604,11,7930,2322,326,41901,61827,8065,272,89412,409,15907,9517,12287,919,1765,3625,97222,11,45575,389,25692,40192,404,326,6,6802,1728,409,1208,13868,648,9952,3625,60404,11,389,25692,40192,404,326,6,2295,66,44547,13109,8065,19910,409,1208,9517,12287,290,11,16968,665,9071,519,409,9517,1517,978,331,404,3869,653,11159,301,3284,1880,19477,3159,13,1708,1105,20263,818,11,4864,36731,46838,337,8047,11,4864,308,34155,6502,924,12646,2159,404,3869,9637,3488,11,10071,9964,100164,11,74699,4864,91507,68226,514,20028,5019,26725,3625,46106,60404,11,3869,1081,20099,1370,91254,11,4538,46110,1448,12339,11,7930,25400,11,264,293,1188,35657,220,20,8261,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,791,1495,8111,311,387,264,22066,3492,6710,477,264,31678,36815,922,279,8712,315,41903,6873,449,2911,13,578,19114,11,889,374,4461,459,72146,477,32185,304,279,2115,315,6873,323,3823,3268,11,13551,1077,4443,3217,315,1694,4691,555,1077,220,20,4771,6418,80115,20263,818,1405,1364,574,1603,1364,574,9405,13,1115,3488,52032,279,19114,311,8881,389,279,12939,315,41903,6873,449,2911,627,198,791,19114,34945,430,1364,11352,279,6725,315,19675,449,2911,1555,279,990,315,55475,4242,26235,445,2877,18022,304,279,220,777,2031,82,11,323,8554,430
