We often call it the blue planet. But beneath all this blue, there's mud, abyssal muck that covers the ocean floor. Do you know, ladies and gentlemen, that this mud is half the surface area of the Earth? A muddy planet, we should say. And yet, this invisible mud shelters a parallel universe of incredible small creatures, small but essential for the balance of our planet. For they are an important link in the food chain of the oceans and especially help to recycle matter that falls from the water's surface. Unfortunately, these small creatures are increasingly threatened by human activities. We are currently in a race to exploit our abyssal plains. And yes, humans are ready to bulldoze the ocean floor to extract minerals like lithium, cobalt, or rare earths. So we need better regulations to protect this wonderful but mysterious ecosystem. We need an effective method to make visible what is invisible in our depths and assess the impact of our activities on this universe that seems so far away yet is so close to us.\n\nTraditionally, how did we do it? Well, we spent hours, days, weeks, or even months at the microscope examining sand grains to find these small creatures. And there are plenty of them - hundreds, thousands per handful of mud, ostracods, copepods, nematodes, polychaetes, and even tardigrades, those extraordinary organisms that resist all life conditions, including space. The problem is that the microscope takes time. And we need a faster method to keep up with industry. So in my thesis, I optimized a new approach, more effective because it allows us to detect all of life. I use environmental DNA (eDNA) extracted directly from abyssal mud. It contains the eDNA of all the small creatures that live there. Then, I look at specific genes, common genes among all living organisms - including ours and theirs. These genes are barcode genes that allow, by decoding them, to identify species present. Thanks to this new method, by analyzing abyssal mud samples from around the world, I create a map of the biodiversity of our deep-sea oceans. As La Fontaine said, 'One often needs something smaller than oneself.' We see it ourselves. Our gut bacteria are essential. They are essential to our life. So let us remember that this small thing can be abyssal. And protect our ocean floors.\"\n\nPlease note that this is a transcript of a speech or presentation, and the tone and style may vary depending on the context in which it was
