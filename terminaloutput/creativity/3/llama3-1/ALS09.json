The author is exploring how the traditional process of selling (identifying potential customers, building rapport, highlighting product benefits, addressing objections, and closing the sale) has changed with the rise of social media.\n\nThe text starts by drawing an analogy between finding love and selling a product, suggesting that both require following a process. The author then describes the traditional sales process in seven steps: prospecting for new customers, identifying a potential client, setting up a meeting, highlighting product benefits, addressing objections, closing the sale, and building a long-term relationship.\n\nThe author notes that with the advent of social media, people can now directly message potential clients or customers without having to go through all the traditional steps. This raises questions about whether the traditional sales process is still relevant in today's digital age.\n\nTo investigate this question, the author conducted interviews with salespeople who use both traditional and digital methods to sell their products or services. The author is interested in understanding how these individuals are adapting to the changing landscape of sales and how they are creating, maintaining, or destabilizing the traditional process of selling.\n\nThe text also references three hypothetical characters: Tonton Albert (who advocates for maintaining the traditional process), Copine Léa (who suggests that a new process is needed), and Petit Frère Tim (who thinks that digital-only relationships can work). The author plans to identify which type of character exists within an organization, observe their actions, and analyze how they are influencing the sales process.\n\nOverall, the text appears to be a thoughtful exploration of how the rise of social media is changing the way people sell products or services, and how individuals and organizations are adapting to these changes.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,1252,6335,665,19266,23985,9189,5534,1339,1744,5019,46524,326,58591,414,11,3900,47090,45347,1370,51854,14240,9521,13,62293,1647,88411,409,8518,1880,3625,9908,7330,333,8467,1744,503,34155,326,355,1765,514,70927,11,4864,94297,9189,13510,1744,5019,19189,265,11,272,17771,4839,1133,24068,321,13,7695,47090,46932,265,653,1920,355,409,74190,13,220,16,13,41621,12584,89,7010,653,31237,12844,11,88817,9211,409,87325,8403,11,22299,7010,653,3703,5019,91026,26077,447,22827,13,220,17,13,41621,3608,57609,89,653,3016,7930,9189,57110,22550,13,1856,332,35657,6502,8811,66090,2922,6496,13,220,18,13,41621,864,55506,66651,45325,13,13789,30362,11,41091,272,17771,54300,36135,13,2998,11943,8047,13,220,19,13,41621,2322,668,89,665,33670,26725,3625,33670,1154,409,15265,54206,13,14465,36731,46680,54149,11,30498,648,817,13,220,20,13,41621,9517,76149,89,3869,15907,54111,13,7695,47090,436,395,7889,514,3016,13,34447,2536,11,4864,73953,5636,3869,1647,506,13,220,21,13,12095,9189,62299,7970,11,9189,17782,89,3869,71139,1208,74190,13,25145,72,5019,8941,99077,13,220,22,13,4366,1208,16578,11,9189,1589,8047,89,6316,12976,409,1317,98020,13,16062,16081,11,66651,45325,3846,57992,11,220,777,71,8065,10960,13,34447,87320,274,6,9034,5615,466,3869,671,1382,26077,447,22827,7010,1208,34923,648,17536,4502,9189,308,6,52659,6502,409,74190,949,12095,389,25692,2167,1133,25400,6233,42219,653,1984,6223,978,1765,3625,9517,325,12249,949,19421,97507,11,9952,326,6,1138,344,8047,951,9517,325,12249,12288,83391,11,389,841,39904,5636,1370,40744,27750,14240,9521,13,8409,1339,54312,39587,1208,1913,3930,1920,355,409,74190,1880,3930,8518,949,27058,514,47929,11,503,34155,3026,978,951,1218,2171,80463,9952,951,95194,83391,13,15663,1771,42587,306,44093,514,1920,355,409,74190,538,2428,1880,294,81979,1081,27462,3869,75144,3625,9517,325,12249,12288,83391,13,4366,51173,11,5019,88817,9211,951,44827,1765,3625,8403,6033,5019,2800,261,665,3729,1370,951,29085,13,24703,7930,296,55624,978,22550,11,3846,15132,3625,48577,4294,4893,3930,2609,1133,294,31109,95234,14135,64829,3869,6316,48659,95234,13,5034,76680,30303,15244,64829,17317,1280,2428,1744,27750,48577,82133,296,804,951,6299,409,81939,11,409,5088,3675,6033,409,7591,267,13052,8082,13,13789,11,4864,296,6,30992,2428,13,27058,46524,326,58591,414,11,15265,6293,483,445,978,64,9189,31025,4618,294,6,14283,1765,6316,17537,72,409,10607,11,409,19266,1072,556,2167,1133,665,27912,51854,48577,409,27389,59958,16271,11,44829,409,3625,91026,665,83195,6033,6502,13,12095,389,17537,2428,3625,887,14014,409,445,978,64,7010,6316,93486,11,45602,5891,72,408,14687,3869,75831,653,43453,1920,355,409,74190,13,350,546,263,17971,11412,9189,13510,934,35329,308,26248,55455,409,64972,1744,294,6,14283,7010,653,3703,11,294,6,370,1382,1208,54613,11,409,1208,19266,1072,556,13,426,1116,11,22299,39043,274,17771,44093,81621,11,389,841,2349,55455,13,46706,6316,93486,11,350,546,263,17971,7625,2058,1339,5019,514,5088,3675,3930,1920,355,409,74190,13,650,52262,46110,1448,12339,9538,550,10515,408,934,54386,25692,25945,14707,39929,6316,12976,29121,1133,16099,1604,13,11697,35411,4864,259,26248,547,21965,90551,92174,13,9538,87264,25945,14707,13,9538,87264,66090,7930,7591,267,13052,1082,514,1920,355,409,74190,13,46706,1208,16578,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,91507,259,1992,294,6,16288,7930,15132,3625,350,546,263,17971,11,6293,483,445,978,64,6033,46110,1448,12339,9538,7010,6316,93486,13,14465,91507,3625,22842,11,28130,1153,261,951,4860,11,20028,951,1218,2171,80463,1880,46131,26077,645,15132,3625,6299,934,85217,82133,296,804,5019,75831,11,5088,268,404,6033,7591,267,13052,12329,514,1920,355,409,74190,13,19421,4502,326,6,5389,404,3930,8518,7591,3825,1339,409,9189,11,9189,33978,89,96308,17971,11,9538,6033,445,978,64,949,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,791,1495,8111,311,387,264,17850,14050,477,264,3495,5684,389,279,8712,315,279,15740,315,6763,11618,304,279,11639,315,3674,3772,13,578,3229,374,24919,1268,279,8776,1920,315,11486,320,1748,7922,4754,6444,11,4857,39474,11,39686,2027,7720,11,28118,54111,11,323,15676,279,6412,8,706,5614,449,279,10205,315,3674,3772,627,198,791,1495,8638,555,13633,459,56203,1990,9455,3021,323,11486,264,2027,11,23377,430,2225,1397,2768,264,1920,13,578,3229,1243,16964,279,8776,6763,1920,304,8254,7504,25,22199,287,369,502,6444,11,25607,264,4754,3016,11,6376,709,264,6574,11,39686,2027,7720,11,28118,54111,11,15676,279,6412,11,323,4857,264,1317,9860,5133,627,198,791,3229,8554,430,449,279,11599,315,3674,3772,11,1274,649,1457,6089,1984,4754,8403,477,6444,2085,3515,311,733,1555,682,279,8776,7504,13,1115,25930,4860,922,3508,279,8776,6763,1920,374,2103,9959,304,3432,596,7528,4325,627,198,1271,19874,420,3488,11,279,3229,13375,19905,449,6763,16455,889,1005,2225,8776,323,7528,5528,311,4662,872,3956,477,3600,13,578,3229,374,8173,304,8830,1268,1521,7931,527,70817,311,279,10223,18921,315,6763,323,1268,814,527,6968,11,20958,11,477,72257,4954,279,8776,1920,315,11486,627,198,791
