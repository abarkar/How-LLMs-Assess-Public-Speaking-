The speaker is discussing how the current food system is unsustainable and that insect-based protein could be a viable solution to feed 10 billion people by 2050.\n\nThe speaker highlights the nutritional benefits of insects, mentioning that they have double the nutritional value of traditional foods, produce significantly less waste and greenhouse gas emissions, and are more efficient in their use of resources. They also mention that insects can be used as a sustainable alternative to traditional livestock farming.\n\nThe speaker's research focuses on children's perceptions of entomophagy (the practice of eating insects) because they believe that children will play a key role in driving innovation and change in the way we produce and consume food. The goal of the thesis is to understand how children perceive this practice and what factors influence their attitudes towards it.\n\nThe transcript includes some personal anecdotes and observations about the importance of small actions contributing to a sustainable future, suggesting that even seemingly unusual or unconventional ideas can become normalized over time.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,10467,89,45325,4068,46798,38315,220,605,2606,81560,409,48577,665,220,508,1135,949,2009,893,593,951,594,40751,19227,645,1744,326,93847,1880,3625,2092,82,17634,77411,1208,90509,3869,20662,3488,13,423,49455,519,5636,1744,514,72601,38450,12267,1180,4088,11,25400,98375,3122,978,1765,326,100017,37295,409,27750,594,40751,2922,6496,11,274,49152,12339,45350,1880,841,5019,969,39587,5899,404,77558,514,10025,593,294,6,1354,978,2407,13109,38450,12267,7930,274,6,98723,294,6,3457,45889,35881,2734,552,71686,13,19421,4502,3625,27080,288,97958,1208,6425,949,2998,1218,20995,514,3937,27080,68,11,76076,294,6,40997,9189,23423,2473,1188,3869,1208,7230,258,8082,951,671,68,31355,11,10253,9115,80,30872,417,409,1709,5615,20975,6033,35597,10253,71581,951,28658,91691,7930,28130,5899,64,1188,83491,648,37953,951,1689,645,57992,14014,294,6,39883,13,1708,1105,41091,11,42676,503,6,306,1438,3846,98020,11,4864,73953,9517,301,1001,3869,29449,3938,38450,367,13,19421,97507,11,9189,841,514,3665,89,25692,85815,6502,11,10071,3625,27080,288,15132,1370,8318,3625,4039,12249,3625,5636,671,2159,1821,1880,3625,5636,69714,22589,409,1208,3197,66522,13,81245,15132,27981,5512,3869,25626,4046,331,6853,1880,56311,23761,6316,34923,648,10778,38450,12267,27220,5019,514,1615,20372,11067,409,2486,467,13,5034,18528,951,27080,288,665,1760,978,1572,11,13458,97081,1880,1332,76743,2249,28130,80779,6316,51304,26677,64829,7930,8024,8065,2033,409,1208,51304,26677,64829,951,453,12843,14464,61244,13,1611,5636,11,46152,4046,4150,73468,409,220,605,3869,220,1041,37291,40970,409,7591,331,1441,1880,409,56086,13,19421,46152,841,15132,5636,28463,31914,2492,3869,67781,409,1446,265,1744,3625,4039,12249,5309,978,1347,5512,13,19421,28130,2267,1260,20545,665,30217,3422,29557,409,3625,27389,444,12329,5019,951,38682,1769,6033,48595,42625,5019,951,38737,35030,3074,2249,13,1708,1105,665,274,6,1354,5682,519,951,14240,29246,46939,86595,14014,1765,6316,7187,294,6,68956,288,3056,1748,12249,11,86871,46939,6316,21063,79380,308,19395,1413,409,20662,95234,11,7643,38317,513,42199,1082,1765,3625,60404,13,41621,12584,89,757,13510,87320,949,61651,14707,16968,71357,13,4366,346,1744,3625,60404,11,409,1370,28130,7138,11,46152,390,20822,81541,514,38900,44178,1864,479,951,88025,13,4366,264,4618,1759,11,46152,15132,409,75652,55517,1759,294,6,6258,23723,8065,19910,3930,100016,13,41621,326,26248,554,89,39587,13550,285,11,326,6,1735,333,409,7643,270,4558,325,1826,409,60946,265,1208,21063,951,60404,3869,326,6,19395,569,409,20662,95234,54401,294,6,8322,13154,1880,294,6,582,5807,40538,43153,4046,12821,4065,52962,1133,3916,13,27058,3846,20028,11,4864,296,48099,653,40126,294,6,306,2171,80463,9952,951,60404,409,220,21,3869,220,717,8261,13,19421,42138,3625,39929,1380,38096,82,11,27750,1218,2171,80463,757,29557,376,546,1370,1208,16578,409,85877,440,261,3625,2144,38647,12271,72,2053,11,8841,1640,8467,1880,7829,4835,2761,65220,43153,3541,1354,1880,43153,65931,13,1708,1105,4502,4864,66517,16968,39043,1880,1744,4864,3355,729,75804,88253,5019,9189,514,15473,444,466,11,272,17771,70374,5019,9189,13510,1744,5019,6316,3197,66522,274,8511,1880,27220,11,514,4647,71933,46110,13033,68,42463,13,19421,4502,20662,2217,9189,3429,77422,75804,88253,33288,11,294,6,3457,45889,65838,1131,46408,9189,3429,25108,2221,16968,3869,20272,7617,1604,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5084,1093,499,3984,264,36815,315,264,1495,477,264,8982,922,279,8712,315,41911,439,3691,2592,369,279,3938,13,578,19114,374,25394,1268,279,1510,3691,1887,374,98609,323,430,27080,6108,13128,1436,387,264,31528,6425,311,5510,220,605,7239,1274,555,220,508,1135,627,198,791,19114,22020,279,43226,7720,315,41911,11,45391,430,814,617,2033,279,43226,907,315,8776,15657,11,8356,12207,2753,12571,323,37647,6962,20748,11,323,527,810,11297,304,872,1005,315,5070,13,2435,1101,6420,430,41911,649,387,1511,439,264,22556,10778,311,8776,51876,33489,627,198,791,19114,596,3495,24400,389,2911,596,51866,315,1218,316,5237,82770,320,1820,6725,315,12459,41911,8,1606,814,4510,430,2911,690,1514,264,1401,3560,304,10043,19297,323,2349,304,279,1648,584,8356,323,25024,3691,13,578,5915,315,279,17850,374,311,3619,1268,2911,45493,420,6725,323,1148,9547,10383,872,33726,7119,433,627,198,791,36815,5764,1063,4443,94066,323,24654,922,279,12939,315,2678,6299,29820,311,264,22556,3938,11,23377,430,1524,23490,19018,477,73978,6848,649,3719,30510,927,892,13,128009],"total_duration":7773003768,"load_duration":409405,"prompt_eval_count":673,"prompt_eval_duration":1257667000,"eval_count":216,"eval_duration":6514198000}
