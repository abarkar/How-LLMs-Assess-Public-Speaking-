This brave man, indeed, was very troubled. He couldn't produce good quality. All the parts he forged, vis, carlingues, gears, were all rejected and thrown away. It was probably due to his simulations. A necessary step that takes place beforehand. The metal he forged being poorly simulated, his colleagues told him. \"Are you stuck? Then call on us who have specially designed machines for fine experiments. By testing your metal, you will be able to improve your model and simulations without pressure.\" But the blacksmith said personally, \"I want to do my trials on industrial presses. My thesis is that I can intelligently exploit the workshop for more independence. If I get the same result with my 5-meter-high presses as with the lab equipment, it will show that it's possible, or even better, to avoid expensive tests.\" He installed his presses. A sensor adapted to measure efforts developed. And with three lasers on the tooling, he could measure deformation. He tested his super-equipped presses on simple cylinders cut from steel. The selected test, simple but not simplistic, crushed the cylinders between two smooth plates. The blacksmith found, thanks to this experiment, the parameters of the useful model for his science. Finished the rejects and non-conforming parts, all these simulations were finally up to standard. But in the meantime, his colleagues had finished their tests. And other parameters were found with success. But for the same material? For the same model? That can't be it. Who is the most faithful? His laboratory colleagues. It's still their job. But the discrepancies between them are not too great. With a few efforts and a few years, there will come a time when everything will be settled. The blacksmith took up his work again and lived happily with small doctorates. Fin.\n\nPlease note that this text appears to be a French story about a blacksmith who develops a new method for testing metal quality. The story includes themes of innovation, perseverance, and the value of collaboration.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,7695,43989,6316,37291,11,7010,653,938,7911,3972,781,396,467,11,653,490,17194,369,1414,263,7930,80664,1339,3709,7770,13,24703,34300,40351,11,665,67781,11,43989,14707,8126,49530,978,13,7695,841,1370,1055,1339,6502,3869,6316,51651,60128,13,350,5612,3625,70477,1634,934,35329,57728,1339,11,2145,11,1841,2785,1157,11,2995,1466,1154,11,97958,40744,2098,355,14014,1880,296,5014,3869,1208,7591,14215,13,356,96287,15878,294,2182,1208,2267,1088,3869,15907,47590,13,39783,14240,2070,100243,7930,513,20272,665,1097,546,13,2009,36252,278,934,35329,57728,1339,14240,519,8811,76773,978,11,15907,4631,4558,70,1157,25400,97057,13,12769,2722,4160,321,6496,8126,49530,978,949,435,2852,39587,76190,3869,17317,7930,57038,951,12933,71269,689,1001,27389,85,1157,5019,951,1367,28154,2436,35018,13,2998,1296,519,8941,36252,278,11,9964,5019,13075,11,15878,3577,290,11,7970,3125,8941,83597,1880,51309,47590,13,8345,34447,514,369,1414,263,22011,3869,64160,17274,11,12769,14465,5320,2249,20028,11083,4043,2852,1765,1685,325,67965,6853,13,11583,270,4558,325,1826,1744,4864,94297,9952,11478,7684,2058,326,6,266,68249,5019,5636,294,6,485,978,3825,685,13,12095,503,6,1138,535,9952,11083,54063,409,220,20,296,75104,409,62321,8065,27584,65285,266,1744,11083,281,17724,8065,10278,78,11,45602,1647,376,2473,934,35329,1826,3284,11,37572,64972,11,409,513,45347,409,70375,951,7177,834,3825,53819,13,8345,7695,4685,64,1765,15907,54063,13,1252,2107,668,324,10737,978,5019,11083,7889,8065,64972,3625,9045,68866,5512,13,19421,9952,56321,72475,1765,326,6,412,48164,348,1056,978,11,272,17771,1208,7591,1659,934,35329,264,18757,11083,7889,13,7695,1367,14081,3904,64,15907,54063,1765,978,36847,14014,1765,409,69406,43021,485,417,35881,13649,5512,7010,326,6,54553,13,2009,1296,71132,52235,11,4382,10071,6502,15858,17194,11,4046,5192,300,1339,3625,43021,485,417,9465,26633,12235,12249,326,85460,13,2009,369,1414,263,26483,6723,11,77433,3869,20662,88411,11,3625,1719,75104,3930,83597,8791,458,3869,829,8198,13,5767,72,514,84129,1880,3625,70477,1634,2536,26965,288,11,40744,27750,47590,97958,665,5589,10253,7617,288,13,34447,9465,27138,11,15907,4631,4558,70,1157,384,77065,1913,72,43153,4043,2852,13,19421,294,81979,1719,75104,282,77065,26483,85,5512,9952,94499,13,34447,5019,514,27584,5634,28154,2933,949,27058,514,27584,83597,949,356,8458,841,513,25692,13,7930,1826,514,5636,33204,51453,949,64027,4631,4558,70,1157,3930,10278,78,13,356,17771,42676,27584,28130,30870,9363,13,34447,3625,91329,7183,9465,84440,841,15132,6502,409,21965,13,62293,45889,9045,1880,45889,65838,11,653,9880,3355,61799,514,27138,39723,16968,35737,9517,6200,978,13,2009,369,1414,263,31736,275,39587,4538,42775,1880,3900,45165,10453,77818,2249,1880,84871,409,86696,10896,1900,13,5767,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,8586,374,279,11093,1495,512,198,12805,5304,264,892,11,304,264,29827,26135,11,1070,574,264,12703,3776,34117,889,9508,36218,13,1115,34300,893,11,13118,11,574,1633,42132,13,1283,7846,956,8356,1695,4367,13,2052,279,5596,568,54299,11,2145,11,1841,2785,1157,11,54260,11,1051,682,18010,323,15338,3201,13,1102,574,4762,4245,311,813,47590,13,362,5995,3094,430,5097,2035,52159,13,578,9501,568,54299,1694,31555,46836,11,813,18105,3309,1461,13,330,11787,499,16075,30,5112,1650,389,603,889,617,35426,6319,12933,369,7060,21896,13,3296,7649,701,9501,11,499,690,387,3025,311,7417,701,1646,323,47590,2085,7410,1210,2030,279,3776,34117,1071,16102,11,330,40,1390,311,656,856,19622,389,13076,54063,13,3092,17850,374,430,358,649,60538,4501,33294,279,26129,369,810,24589,13,1442,358,636,279,1890,1121,449,856,220,20,73601,28661,54063,439,449,279,10278,7241,11,433,690,1501,430,433,596,3284,11,477,1524,2731,11,311,5766,11646,7177,1210,1283,10487,813,54063,13,362,12271,30464,311,6767,9045,8040,13,1628,449,2380,72475,389,279,5507,287,11,568,1436,6767,91621,13,1283,12793,813,2307,88202,54063,389,4382,75421,4018,505,9699,13,578,4183,1296,11,4382,719,539,78630,11,33745,279,75421,1990,1403,11113,25485,13,578,3776,34117,1766,11,9523,311,420,9526,11,279,5137,315,279,5505,1646,369,813,8198,13,53726,279,60515,323,2536,15204,55857,5596,11,682,1521,47590,1051,5616,709,311,5410,13,2030,304,279,33953,11,813,18105,1047,8220,872,7177,13,1628,1023,5137,1051,1766,449,2450,13,2030,369,279,1890,3769,30,1789,279,1890,1646,30,3011,649,956,387,433,13,10699,374,279,1455,37513,30,5414,27692,18105,13,1102,596,2103,872,2683,13,2030,279,91367,1990,1124,527,539,2288,2294,13,3161,264,2478,9045,323,264,2478,1667,11,1070,690,2586,264,892,994,4395,690,387,23183,13,578,3776,34117,3952,709,813,990,1578,323,12439,37875,449,2678,10896,988,13,5767,627,198,5618,5296,430,420,1495,8111,311,387,264,8753,3446,922,264,3776,34117,889,39671,264,502,1749,369,7649,9501,4367,13,578,3446,5764,22100,315,19297,11,99841,11,323,279,907,315,20632,13,128009],"total_duration":14238526435,"load_duration":610763,"prompt_eval_count":563,"prompt_eval_duration":1068583000,"eval_count":435,"eval_dur
