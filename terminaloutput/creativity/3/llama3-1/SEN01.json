It's a transcript of a conversation between the narrator and Edna Mode, a famous costume designer for superheroes. The narrator is a researcher who has discovered the secret to creating advanced materials with unique properties.\n\nThe conversation starts by discussing the gecko's ability to walk on ceilings, which is attributed to its millions of nanoscale lamellae under its feet. This phenomenon has inspired Spider-Man's famous costume, showcasing the power of biomimicry.\n\nHowever, the narrator and Edna Mode are more interested in creating materials with multiple properties, such as hydrophile-hydrophobe (water-loving-water-repelling) properties for Aquaman to adapt to his underwater environment. To achieve this, they use polymers, which are chains of molecules that can be thought of as a necklace of pearls.\n\nThe narrator has developed a unique method of creating these polymers by forming two teams of molecular \"swimmers\" that perform synchronized swimming at the molecular level. One team is like Michael Phelps, with 28 Olympic medals, while the other team is more laid-back and flexible, like a synchronized swimmer.\n\nBy combining these two teams, the narrator creates a single team that can \"swim\" through water and grab onto each other to form a cohesive material with super properties. The process involves tricotting (crocheting) the polymer chains at the molecular level on the surface of water.\n\nThe goal is to create a collection of costumes for different superheroes, each with its unique set of properties based on specific polymers. With great power comes great responsibility, and with great materials comes great flexibility!\n\nWhat do you think? Are you excited about the possibilities of biomimicry and advanced materials in the field of superhero costume design?","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,18714,2852,53070,45325,514,6367,3930,3980,32563,949,12535,3846,46110,63828,89,569,20272,57375,5019,15572,261,8065,628,2642,2159,949,61651,14707,11,3900,2278,4558,451,32592,15907,84167,288,951,11990,409,32703,37907,409,62827,20622,316,978,376,2428,13,3959,52571,1759,14848,5906,665,4046,28580,934,2053,15132,514,76680,9011,10367,409,8603,958,76,1286,3395,17724,13,2998,67781,11,43153,22337,20243,2482,69260,406,19637,645,409,308,6,94896,74940,7479,732,288,22639,14848,27584,12979,978,3869,29490,31251,4538,84850,4558,21152,32519,13,62408,3941,3930,39538,318,10515,44618,11,272,17771,2307,11,308,17771,54312,6502,949,34447,1208,48659,8541,685,11,3846,15132,951,86374,4298,2249,10253,21744,10515,5512,66160,13,356,17771,87320,1208,33651,817,34280,68636,5019,2307,2902,978,3714,3279,3458,14904,32592,80367,635,98544,81,12416,3930,46110,11494,409,9511,67763,1744,4864,36731,1208,59157,8082,294,22827,32519,8065,272,1494,1291,951,10405,28800,34561,9111,9189,3869,41091,11,4864,15562,68,23815,13005,294,93825,514,11679,35285,2249,3290,60224,409,3846,32519,3869,1208,37291,17055,764,458,1880,17055,764,15784,5019,274,6,20311,8065,83259,50026,52985,13,15089,220,5599,5741,1826,26014,1841,33254,424,514,38900,3930,5634,258,8065,57992,11,294,69537,541,11,10071,6502,15878,67009,13,27058,75831,951,45188,11,389,1080,30872,668,951,89672,31605,5512,409,2606,4918,409,13826,25108,4978,409,46033,31539,665,46838,541,265,1236,288,46033,31539,15132,951,665,6583,25108,77,3808,409,22337,20243,2482,1744,326,54386,25692,513,71925,1992,22299,653,1400,5741,409,824,645,11,1370,86633,40744,3625,123299,9004,11,1370,86633,6316,7064,685,13,362,46777,824,273,1880,3869,46777,3698,2259,3416,409,824,645,4538,68226,11,2389,14081,519,10253,13826,25108,4978,409,46033,31539,951,21744,10515,5512,2598,24520,31539,1744,326,54386,25692,3698,10670,8065,19910,294,22827,27584,5634,28154,2933,13,4366,51173,11,9952,653,1488,409,52155,25595,87,10071,28800,31807,11451,1880,653,1488,294,31769,4354,2194,11,389,4615,1188,653,4631,519,11,3869,1208,37291,25595,87,11,67009,481,1880,14240,26014,11,15878,220,5599,5741,25945,503,14559,1345,2852,1826,54312,934,41901,73655,653,4631,519,20272,409,9189,653,2307,2902,978,3714,949,3341,653,2307,41238,3972,2278,4558,451,653,46110,5636,66517,519,43905,1208,44178,16271,13,1219,2727,5019,514,3980,32563,11,503,6,454,12339,3869,326,31769,331,6853,22337,978,3395,12267,13,27058,45602,11,503,34155,1376,978,26633,4046,447,9100,409,46033,31539,10253,68330,12843,409,1208,18050,367,14453,285,8047,1236,64,55133,4046,61673,1826,3930,955,8096,98615,11,220,1591,35030,87455,297,14163,8467,13,5034,513,95959,11,96308,3930,17779,3869,27389,69,52424,514,393,15433,321,57123,10253,94527,22253,1354,11,264,25400,272,13059,519,77433,1880,19724,645,325,13,445,27688,8047,1826,39587,409,3625,9517,359,404,5019,4846,6316,86806,4046,61673,409,523,14460,1345,2852,6502,409,7363,2428,11,1208,70356,978,4539,648,1744,4864,28130,16796,27389,1768,8047,1826,96308,293,77725,13,7695,28130,8657,275,409,1344,354,466,44829,409,274,6,351,94365,3625,7120,10253,46106,13,19421,97507,11,4864,490,292,1295,2167,1133,3625,13826,25108,4978,409,46033,31539,409,46777,4046,61673,3869,1208,7479,409,326,93847,885,32384,11,4864,57128,6316,4020,1557,409,22337,20243,2482,21874,8047,11,24955,7060,1880,13046,8047,409,2307,21744,10515,5512,934,35329,757,66167,35597,3869,54067,13,5186,12416,653,28800,409,8198,1880,76776,48488,409,30401,11,1647,4046,61673,409,308,425,1759,1826,409,7287,25945,2804,5048,13,423,6,3457,1208,1913,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,3279,3458,3567,14687,27584,23761,665,84921,409,10045,261,43905,6316,4526,409,45188,3869,1208,2385,409,85114,46033,31539,15715,266,8467,5636,71269,333,8467,3869,294,81979,2307,2902,978,3714,5253,83,97507,11,653,6800,68226,11866,2428,409,38546,13826,25108,4978,409,22337,20243,2482,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,27387,1495,0,1102,596,264,36815,315,264,10652,1990,279,65271,323,3279,3458,14904,11,264,11495,32519,15034,369,91818,13,578,65271,374,264,32185,889,706,11352,279,6367,311,6968,11084,7384,449,5016,6012,627,198,791,10652,8638,555,25394,279,3980,32563,596,5845,311,4321,389,56814,11,902,374,30706,311,1202,11990,315,20622,437,2296,32703,616,6043,1234,1202,7693,13,1115,25885,706,14948,29490,31251,596,11495,32519,11,67908,279,2410,315,39538,318,292,894,627,198,11458,11,279,65271,323,3279,3458,14904,527,810,8173,304,6968,7384,449,5361,6012,11,1778,439,17055,764,458,2902,68107,764,15784,320,13284,77700,55051,5621,79,6427,8,6012,369,23815,13005,311,10737,311,813,46474,4676,13,2057,11322,420,11,814,1005,46033,388,11,902,527,27271,315,35715,430,649,387,3463,315,439,264,55547,315,92732,627,198,791,65271,706,8040,264,5016,1749,315,6968,1521,46033,388,555,30164,1403,7411,315,31206,330,2332,73683,1,430,2804,22183,24269,520,279,31206,2237,13,3861,2128,374,1093,8096,98615,11,449,220,1591,25944,60082,11,1418,279,1023,2128,374,810,17551,15825,323,19303,11,109
