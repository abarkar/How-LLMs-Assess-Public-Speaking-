Here's my attempt to translate it:\n\n\"The volcanoes are creatures of fire. No, they fascinate us. But these volcanoes are not immortal. They eventually die out just as we do. Not from cardiac arrest, but rather exhaustion of their magmatic pump. I am a structural geologist, and the goal of my thesis is to determine the anatomy of a dead volcano undergoing decomposition. This volcano is the Piton des Neiges, which has been extinct for over 20,000 years and has been exposed to the elements. Now that its flanks are eroded by cirques, the cliffs carved out by rivers, and rare episodes of activity, I, a mortal, venture into the bowels of this giant. With hammer and compass in hand, like a doctor with a stethoscope, I examine the rocks of the Piton des Neiges. It sometimes happens that I observe fractures, which are evidence of great catastrophes that upset my patient's diagnosis and complicate my diagnosis. My work involves first establishing a map of the rocks and fractures present in my patient. This is what we call geological mapping. I also perform additional tests to determine the composition of the rocks I have carefully selected, as well as their age, thanks to observations under the microscope and sophisticated chemical analyses. All these indices allow me to reconstruct one million years of history of this old Piton des Neiges, its constructions and destructions. But let's go back to the fractures, because fractures are my specialty. Fractures are zones of weakness that weaken volcanoes. It is they who are responsible for landslides and rockfalls. It is therefore important to know if these fractures have been well-repaired, well-sealed. In fact, not at all, because I am a structural geologist. And what does 'structuralist' mean? Structure means fracture. So the unhealed fractures are exactly what interests me. I am not a doctor, so I do not aim to heal them, but rather to know if there is treasure hidden within them. But what could be this treasure on an extinct volcano called the Piton des Neiges? Clearly, it's the heat, or more specifically, hot water, geothermal energy. But how can we know if it really hides within? That's the whole point of the second part of my thesis. I will perform an ultrasonic test along this thesis. By passing an electric wire through the soil to know if hot fluids or thermos are hiding there. In other words, I am trying to know if the fractures of the Piton des Neiges do not constitute a vast network of canals filled with hot water within which it would be possible to drill and bring this hot water to the surface to generate electricity. You have understood, ladies and gentlemen, that I will certainly not invent hot water, but I have three years to try to find it.\"\n\nPlease note that the translation may not be perfect, as the text
