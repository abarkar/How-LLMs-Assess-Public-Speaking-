To demonstrate this, they use an example: if they open their hand and let their phone fall to the ground, the phone will likely land on the floor or even break. This illustrates the concept of projection, where we anticipate the consequences of an action before it occurs.\n\nThe speaker then transitions to discuss planification (planning), which is the main theme of their thesis. They explain that historically, planning has been a fundamental domain in artificial intelligence, allowing for the creation of autonomous robots like Opportunity, which was deployed on Mars in 2004 and spent 15 years collecting data before being shut down.\n\nThe speaker notes that planning typically requires a deterministic environment with no external influences. In contrast, their thesis work focuses on planning in a dynamic and unknown environment, which is more challenging. To achieve this, they rely on the human brain's ability to process complex information through three mechanisms:\n\n1. The power of habit: When we perform routine tasks, like unlocking our phone, our brains have learned these actions through repetition.\n2. Energy efficiency: We often choose the most satisfying solution, rather than the optimal one, in order to conserve mental energy.\n3. Dynamic planning: The world is constantly evolving, and planning must adapt to this changing environment.\n\nThe speaker concludes their presentation by noting that they need to take a call from their thesis advisor and will stop there.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,622,82405,404,2727,1744,17317,74533,26725,2107,4893,409,550,15433,556,326,6,5389,404,13,3489,6870,949,41621,841,757,272,3433,10333,6502,949,14465,91507,9189,514,7591,1677,95920,13,12095,4864,35456,82,1647,100007,11,22299,272,76832,11,1880,1744,503,6,283,49606,1208,1925,11,1744,11412,2442,57375,513,45347,949,4275,98676,519,6502,4499,261,11,1647,100007,11412,10390,655,1370,88026,1880,25692,85815,513,272,34858,13,41621,23933,10333,11,9189,62299,26725,2107,4893,409,27389,35573,3625,1615,978,45045,294,31109,1957,7930,841,274,17771,6502,35597,86595,8047,13,356,17771,3846,934,54386,917,6853,1208,22343,13,19421,17317,4186,19941,20662,23878,13109,26725,3625,49301,11,665,54008,1291,5019,59394,951,35881,6948,13,4366,51173,11,4502,4864,5320,2249,917,8023,1647,2167,12844,409,270,4558,325,11,1744,503,53149,6853,14707,4046,1325,336,479,26725,3625,49301,11,1744,51441,12,3841,20028,949,7695,47090,1744,4864,864,77,818,1647,100007,11,1744,4864,514,7591,424,583,4618,11,1744,503,6,52009,7010,514,9517,79,62704,11,1744,4864,52571,4538,99077,7010,1208,34024,11,5019,665,5589,326,53149,8023,13,19421,5019,46777,14240,2070,11,503,6,27153,361,6316,22343,13,24703,1744,17317,11457,2439,409,20028,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,409,46524,6316,22343,11,6316,16578,294,6,4109,5019,93381,71933,653,1665,333,11,274,53149,6853,1208,3197,2461,11,1880,1826,514,270,25253,12717,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,22425,81235,11,1208,3197,2461,1826,653,951,8106,288,28405,1045,1759,409,326,55624,8677,1989,1104,72,6853,13,46408,264,14175,285,409,75831,951,29807,22299,66090,63484,13,27058,66056,7930,841,514,74282,79738,6502,11,4160,3457,48379,13,24703,12585,3154,263,638,11,7591,981,978,1765,21725,665,220,1049,19,11,264,24560,7591,6595,978,3900,379,264,45889,5347,33903,11,42138,220,868,65838,409,82134,1880,781,7911,2249,3600,11,1880,220,868,65838,409,3197,2461,13,356,13059,519,11,5019,1744,829,3197,2461,34501,818,11,3900,47090,934,35329,513,2503,361,7010,653,50026,40280,4684,4558,79507,7591,23827,978,11,1880,39723,3900,308,59858,264,6502,294,81979,6299,1744,3625,4502,15564,13,9648,519,13510,1744,274,35329,50590,14425,69068,653,49295,3675,11,45602,44521,1339,24560,4684,76366,13,3206,42775,409,270,4558,325,1826,294,6,14283,5636,78060,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,409,58673,15610,7010,653,50026,40280,18003,2428,1880,304,5259,84,13,27058,45602,11,503,49963,1082,653,2307,12,8904,324,1744,9189,4635,2852,53070,26725,11,514,272,5976,2933,2854,467,13,19421,665,54008,1291,11,56321,32118,4919,2191,288,13,2009,272,5976,2933,2854,467,1826,653,72601,409,10758,11,7930,1826,653,72601,409,10758,7930,1826,25945,3062,13,2009,21134,11,272,17771,1208,5457,409,326,6,10796,3993,13,445,1105,593,4864,7591,424,583,4618,1647,4046,73085,409,100007,11,503,6,27153,361,665,20272,653,40126,409,54409,12760,69125,11,1744,4864,66517,409,85722,5636,6033,40970,3154,263,638,11,66021,1744,4864,3625,16796,2267,1220,19227,1001,409,37291,1744,4864,3625,16796,917,6091,13,2009,26633,90272,11,272,17771,326,31769,45317,648,294,31769,64374,17108,31037,13,622,6,4202,2852,18757,46524,653,49348,3197,5019,917,8023,1647,2167,12844,409,270,4558,325,11,1370,51173,11,665,2322,61512,4538,99077,665,4799,72,11,6033,14707,665,312,45019,4538,99077,11,10071,11,22299,48488,409,47104,11,4864,35456,82,1208,6425,1208,5636,8795,2852,5048,13,2009,8348,13532,25253,11,272,17771,1208,3197,2461,18003,2428,13,2009,38900,1826,665,738,5048,51913,3294,11,1880,4046,12821,361,15878,272,24201,13,16770,9165,729,11,1120,1133,11,1647,2167,12844,409,270,4558,325,757,61158,6853,13,14465,91507,2961,5615,466,7643,3197,2461,1880,296,6,1138,5615,466,39015,13,25145,72,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,32,36815,304,8753,0,6914,596,1464,433,1523,512,198,791,19114,57876,430,5127,374,13171,315,52997,279,3938,13,2057,20461,420,11,814,1005,459,3187,25,422,814,1825,872,1450,323,1095,872,4641,4498,311,279,5015,11,279,4641,690,4461,4363,389,279,6558,477,1524,1464,13,1115,46480,279,7434,315,22343,11,1405,584,48248,279,16296,315,459,1957,1603,433,13980,627,198,791,19114,1243,34692,311,4358,3197,2461,320,501,6073,705,902,374,279,1925,7057,315,872,17850,13,2435,10552,430,35901,11,9293,706,1027,264,16188,8106,304,21075,11478,11,10923,369,279,9886,315,39293,29807,1093,48379,11,902,574,27167,389,21725,304,220,1049,19,323,7543,220,868,1667,26984,828,1603,1694,9495,1523,627,198,791,19114,8554,430,9293,11383,7612,264,73449,4676,449,912,9434,34453,13,763,13168,11,872,17850,990,24400,389,9293,304,264,8915,323,9987,4676,11,902,374,810,17436,13,2057,11322,420,11,814,17631,389,279,3823,8271,596,5845,311,1920,6485,2038,1555,2380,24717,512,198,16,13,578,2410,315,14464,25,3277,584,2804,14348,9256,11,1093,80478,1057,4641,11,1057,35202,617,9687,1521,6299,1555,54515,13,198,17,13,12634,15374,25,1226,3629,5268,279,1455,37154,6425,11,4856,1109,279,23669,832,11,304,2015,311,78548,10723,4907,13,198,18,13,22648,9293,25,578,1917,374,15320,42028,11,323,9293,2011,10737,311,420,10
