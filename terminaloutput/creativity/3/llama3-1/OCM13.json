The speaker discusses various statistics, including the growth of tourism worldwide and the fact that one person out of seven has traveled around the world. They also mention that India is experiencing rapid growth in its middle class, with 300 million people expected to be part of it soon.\n\nThe speaker notes that Occitanie is the fourth region in France for welcoming foreign tourists and that tourism plays a significant role in the local economy. They suggest that the region has many assets that could attract Indian tourists, such as cultural and historical landmarks like Paris and the Mont-Saint-Michel.\n\nHowever, the speaker also mentions that others, such as the Hauts-de-France region, are already actively targeting the Indian market. The speaker's thesis is focused on identifying the tools, processes, and techniques needed to welcome, retain, and bring back Indian tourists.\n\nThroughout the transcript, the speaker emphasizes the importance of working together to attract and accommodate Indian tourists. They encourage listeners to think about how they can contribute to this effort, whether through their own actions or by supporting local businesses in the tourism industry.\n\nOverall, the speech appears to be a call to action for the region's residents and stakeholders to work together to capitalize on the growing demand from Indian tourists.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,29614,283,71,11,3625,84064,417,3930,32083,68,758,921,20234,76132,11,46152,5208,306,13,19421,272,17771,25945,14707,13,3263,42441,89,665,220,679,22,13,39783,54613,1765,35429,7010,514,38900,264,23933,351,978,90053,409,1208,3197,66522,13,10467,89,45325,1744,326,6,22513,13145,648,1826,1208,934,2416,25253,88100,409,9822,5019,326,69537,52908,951,31070,288,4046,376,14381,949,19421,49733,11,514,32083,68,11,272,17771,653,92800,1765,294,953,13,10467,89,45325,1744,326,6,1451,68,1826,665,5542,409,46131,829,86806,37417,52138,26193,93381,71933,84364,409,220,3101,11990,294,6,485,65023,355,949,41621,9189,66651,42463,949,220,3101,11990,11,272,17771,272,6009,37291,1208,7187,93424,13,61651,14707,41091,11,4864,36731,5804,467,32824,1744,326,6,22513,13145,648,264,26725,3625,520,11934,5019,19266,1072,556,20662,48659,3016,51453,13,1708,1105,13085,89,11,4068,653,7317,6491,556,22299,514,308,9769,10367,25692,20028,5019,19266,1072,556,27750,87325,31070,288,949,41621,11,42676,9189,45640,89,11,9189,47592,951,2109,31539,949,61651,14707,41091,11,4864,73953,1744,3625,31070,288,1280,80463,28463,14848,63669,13,81245,14848,63669,409,2109,31539,13,19421,272,17771,39015,1744,503,57286,664,648,951,10105,13,11583,270,4558,325,513,10219,265,1765,26725,3625,704,8839,7930,29557,376,546,294,69537,361,484,404,11,312,2002,404,1880,20028,19443,404,27750,87325,31070,288,13,3489,2053,1920,355,48021,665,2035,949,3489,37907,22639,949,3489,37907,12823,949,19421,87320,6502,6316,48659,75467,949,41621,326,6,52659,13550,285,11,7643,270,4558,325,1826,33547,13,29124,45317,648,11,59471,11,8661,11,15983,38469,13,62408,38317,3613,68495,16968,514,38900,66021,934,80720,1131,4366,346,1744,16968,514,38900,1131,80905,514,38900,1826,11866,76366,7010,3846,46494,13,1611,84364,6033,409,78060,11,20662,38317,1826,36897,13,1708,1105,11,4864,73953,1744,12155,31070,288,1280,80463,14848,63669,934,54386,274,6,14310,86577,294,48968,2249,13,445,6,1735,333,409,1647,42775,1826,409,282,15433,52424,3625,7970,4978,98733,5512,7010,326,39982,35657,7218,648,11,1208,98052,2060,11,3625,6732,31070,8467,13,19421,27584,9189,11,6681,2303,729,11,7010,26317,6299,13,1708,1105,11,272,17771,83195,11,3900,379,264,12366,11,272,17771,72006,13,7695,379,264,514,9995,6354,1673,5364,91340,11,272,17771,62321,13,7695,379,264,3625,84334,82,6953,7424,35206,11,10071,274,1815,89,934,48968,2249,11,46152,15132,665,5542,409,4143,1133,22199,261,514,84751,1280,3675,13,1708,1105,11,503,6,25632,12339,11,503,6,25632,12339,11,11083,67,986,11,9622,46138,11,1744,9189,9189,5945,10176,408,23577,409,3846,4545,13,622,6,25632,12339,1744,3846,4545,35737,653,4545,3062,5019,9189,13,19421,503,6,25632,12339,1744,514,38900,11412,513,9517,588,15610,13,19421,1744,87158,9189,66283,34886,951,31070,288,4046,376,14381,7010,29449,7317,6491,556,11,9189,9189,958,299,713,89,1765,3846,1744,9189,45366,20028,5019,64972,3625,1046,361,484,404,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,791,36815,8111,311,387,264,8982,477,15864,922,279,32083,5064,304,20522,13145,648,320,64,5654,304,18561,9822,8,323,1202,4754,369,51647,7904,32753,13,578,19114,35434,5370,13443,11,2737,279,6650,315,32083,15603,323,279,2144,430,832,1732,704,315,8254,706,31796,2212,279,1917,13,2435,1101,6420,430,6890,374,25051,11295,6650,304,1202,6278,538,11,449,220,3101,3610,1274,3685,311,387,961,315,433,5246,627,198,791,19114,8554,430,20522,13145,648,374,279,11999,5654,304,9822,369,36387,7362,32753,323,430,32083,11335,264,5199,3560,304,279,2254,8752,13,2435,4284,430,279,5654,706,1690,12032,430,1436,9504,7904,32753,11,1778,439,13042,323,13970,61024,1093,12366,323,279,9995,6354,1673,5364,91340,627,198,11458,11,279,19114,1101,34945,430,3885,11,1778,439,279,84334,82,6953,7424,35206,5654,11,527,2736,22815,25103,279,7904,3157,13,578,19114,596,17850,374,10968,389,25607,279,7526,11,11618,11,323,12823,4460,311,10788,11,14389,11,323,4546,1203,7904,32753,627,198,60105,279,36815,11,279,19114,66159,279,12939,315,3318,3871,311,9504,323,29376,7904,32753,13,2435,15253,24475,311,1781,922,1268,814,649,17210,311,420,5149,11,3508,1555,872,1866,6299,477,555,12899,2254,9873,304,279,32083,5064,627,198,28589,11,279,8982,8111,311,387,264,1650,311,1957,369,279,5654,596,11062,323,39210,311,990,3871,311,53825,389,279,7982,7631,505,7904,32753,13,128009],"total_duration":9671723952,"load_duration":170972,"prompt_eval_count":600,"prompt_eval_duration":1199444000,"eval_count":279,"eval_duration":8471662000}
