I'll do my best to provide an English translation and summary:\n\nThe speaker begins by referencing Homer's Odyssey, comparing the journey of Odysseus (Ulysse) to the concept of economic social evolution. The speaker notes that economic social dynamics are evolving rapidly, particularly in Europe.\n\nThe speaker highlights the importance of understanding the social economy and its impact on commercial environments. They argue that the current environment is not favorable for social prices and that there is a lack of data to create a favorable business environment.\n\nThe speaker claims that Maresex (perhaps an abbreviation or organization?) will contribute to the study of economic social indicators, which will ultimately help find the contribution between social economies and prices.\n\nThe second part of the speech focuses on the importance of the social economy. The speaker references a recent agreement between Australia and France regarding submarine production, noting that this could lead to job losses (100 jobs over 10 years). This, in turn, would have a significant impact on the overall economy (20% of enterprises being social, resulting in a 40% reduction in taste in the final product).\n\nThe speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of understanding economic social dynamics and how they can provide insights for the future. The translation ends abruptly, suggesting that the original text was cut off or incomplete.\n\nPlease note that my translation is based on my understanding of the French text, but I may not have captured every nuance or detail.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,356,17771,514,45640,294,6,52,61492,325,11,4160,648,294,6,27887,68238,1744,4538,9859,1879,333,689,275,40351,409,25595,36077,11,3625,32116,7930,274,6,83336,306,77558,25400,1880,934,35329,8508,275,3625,7120,42138,3625,46106,13,19421,74699,326,31769,45317,648,75107,11,326,31769,65272,409,326,31769,45317,648,75107,11,272,17771,25945,3062,13,11876,18003,2191,288,409,326,31769,45317,648,75107,4046,12821,11942,25945,100198,1880,64898,11814,2700,2473,1208,19035,1765,326,31769,45317,648,75107,7010,326,6,31880,732,8458,76605,13510,1744,326,41901,2842,40280,294,6,2933,69572,88253,11,3900,308,17771,6502,7970,5019,3625,38847,12288,83391,1880,3625,38847,12288,83391,308,6,546,6502,48488,409,46681,5019,75831,653,50026,40280,8518,37849,13,356,8458,76605,13510,934,35329,308,17771,6502,3284,409,46524,1208,19035,13,64898,11814,2700,2473,1208,19035,409,326,31769,45317,648,75107,665,14240,41939,3625,20934,598,951,38847,1880,665,26483,77282,3625,13519,1759,5368,818,37291,27750,13519,1759,3073,306,11,4864,46524,2192,1208,19035,9465,3625,82653,552,65207,1880,3625,38847,13,19421,74699,11,87320,326,31769,45317,648,75107,30,7695,379,264,653,46415,11,3900,264,24560,1879,978,653,14902,9465,326,52374,5523,648,1880,1208,9822,13,356,8458,76605,13510,1208,59251,409,26725,3625,32592,71098,1354,7930,1022,8135,220,1041,8654,385,285,1765,220,605,65838,732,8458,76605,13510,28201,13,3489,17771,54312,7930,513,39904,30,38891,89,6316,82653,648,7930,31435,220,508,4,951,97263,65207,1880,45602,4790,21581,1339,7010,220,1272,4,6316,9517,23985,409,733,60768,7010,514,54206,1620,13,356,8458,76605,13510,6316,82653,648,25945,36897,1880,75332,3486,9833,1105,11,17317,23423,2439,1744,274,35329,379,264,6316,82653,648,75107,25945,36897,11,665,42587,519,27750,13519,1759,11,45602,17317,87885,1137,3869,326,6,5389,404,1880,3869,71751,6316,11376,9517,41546,4008,8047,951,7591,81,1924,82653,8467,1880,1131,272,17771,6502,1131,272,17771,10415,978,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5084,1093,499,617,3984,264,36815,315,264,8982,477,15864,304,8753,11,449,1063,1495,430,374,539,25548,13,358,3358,656,856,1888,311,3493,459,6498,14807,323,12399,512,198,791,19114,12302,555,57616,66805,596,66881,11,27393,279,11879,315,25578,1065,325,355,320,52,61492,325,8,311,279,7434,315,7100,3674,15740,13,578,19114,8554,430,7100,3674,30295,527,42028,19019,11,8104,304,4606,627,198,791,19114,22020,279,12939,315,8830,279,3674,8752,323,1202,5536,389,8518,22484,13,2435,18046,430,279,1510,4676,374,539,37849,369,3674,7729,323,430,1070,374,264,6996,315,828,311,1893,264,37849,2626,4676,627,198,791,19114,8349,430,64898,11814,320,66372,459,72578,477,7471,10380,690,17210,311,279,4007,315,7100,3674,34824,11,902,690,13967,1520,1505,279,19035,1990,3674,37671,323,7729,627,198,791,2132,961,315,279,8982,24400,389,279,12939,315,279,3674,8752,13,578,19114,15407,264,3293,9306,1990,8494,323,9822,9002,58629,5788,11,27401,430,420,1436,3063,311,2683,18151,320,1041,7032,927,220,605,1667,570,1115,11,304,2543,11,1053,617,264,5199,5536,389,279,8244,8752,320,508,4,315,40919,1694,3674,11,13239,304,264,220,1272,4,14278,304,12945,304,279,1620,2027,570,198,198,791,19114,45537,555,82003,279,12939,315,8830,7100,3674,30295,323,1268,814,649,3493,26793,369,279,3938,13,578,14807,10548,60845,11,23377,430,279,4113,1495,574,4018,1022,477,33243,627,198,5618,5296,430,856,14807,374,3196,389,856,8830,315,279,8753,1495,11,719,358,1253,539,617,17439,1475,11148,685,477,7872,13,128009],"total_duration":9991896842,"load_duration":378214,"prompt_eval_count":394,"prompt_eval_duration":750631000,"eval_count":309,"eval_duration":9240162000}
