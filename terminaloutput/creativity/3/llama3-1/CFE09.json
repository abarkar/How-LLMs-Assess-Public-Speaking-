You'll probably say, \"Ah, spring is coming, birds are singing, and fields are blooming!\" And that's exactly right. But me? I'm going to tell you about a different kind of war. A battle that takes place in your body, specifically in your intestine, when you're the victim of food poisoning.\n\nThe villain in this story is Echerichia coli entéro-hémorragique (EHEC). It can be present in undercooked beef or unpasteurized milk products. And the problem is that insufficient cooking or lack of pasteurization allows it to survive and reach your plate. Once infected, your intestine becomes a battleground.\n\nTo understand how this works, let's go back to Game of Thrones. In the series, there are two worlds: one inhabited by the White Walkers, and the other by civilization. The two are separated by a massive wall designed to protect civilization. In your body, it's the same principle. Just as the White Walkers approach the wall to attack, EHEC bacteria arrive at the level of your intestine's lining and attach themselves.\n\nThis will cause abdominal pain. Worse still, these bacteria produce small soldiers capable of crossing the wall (toxic compounds). Once through the intestinal lining, these toxins find their way into the bloodstream and head towards vital organs like the kidneys and brain to cause kidney failure and neurological disorders.\n\nBut don't panic! The wall is protected by guards (the immune system). When it detects the presence of bacteria and toxins, it produces several molecules to combat the infection. One such molecule is nitric oxide (NO). You can think of NO as the guards protecting the wall. They can kill off the White Walkers, but there aren't enough of them to eliminate all of them.\n\nSo, could they succeed if they were more numerous? Similarly, we know that nitric oxide reduces the number of bacteria and toxins in the intestine. However, this isn't sufficient to prevent infection altogether. Can nitric oxide be used as a treatment?\n\nThat's exactly what my thesis aims to answer. I'm studying how nitric oxide acts on bacteria and toxins in the intestine and investigating the mechanisms used by the bacterium to resist nitric oxide. So, if like me, you're eager to know whether civilization will be saved or if nitric oxide can be used as a treatment, stay tuned for my research findings... probably within a few months at the end of this season (or my thesis)!","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,12095,4864,9189,834,100136,220,679,24,11,9189,73953,89,3869,75249,949,41621,12584,89,757,13510,11,3625,297,1082,12249,44453,306,11,3625,71581,13259,324,79738,11,272,17771,514,1194,336,1725,13,61651,14707,41091,4864,9189,75871,82,11,12688,374,5108,13,14465,1370,273,14707,97717,409,1208,84143,409,326,6,495,547,80091,409,1208,47528,4140,315,47494,13,1708,1105,4864,436,395,554,16968,409,16578,3625,7359,1880,3625,40970,7359,11,4864,841,91507,6502,9189,15473,444,466,3846,7930,11412,513,45347,13,11842,11,4502,4864,36731,39015,3846,57992,11,272,17771,5019,9189,89504,294,22827,47838,955,409,1709,67100,13,39783,293,460,4618,7930,264,39381,7010,15265,34922,11,5636,51625,285,42625,7010,15265,39408,258,11,87158,9189,62299,5310,547,294,31109,72815,367,38450,12267,13,2009,32118,11943,7010,20662,87810,11,272,17771,1208,293,533,35285,469,9211,718,689,74110,1218,56771,2902,17060,269,4193,2428,13,46408,25692,23761,30179,6960,7010,514,293,52822,1739,305,613,978,6033,3625,54021,8065,1208,275,23010,13,19421,514,80259,11,272,17771,1744,1208,31547,942,829,625,5048,409,1208,3355,23775,6033,326,6,3518,768,409,3347,12844,8082,3930,1208,275,841,29557,73468,6502,409,1208,259,8977,33670,934,80720,513,38831,83384,7010,15265,1089,3978,668,13,39783,37291,34527,8047,11,15265,39408,258,513,5276,68,13,2998,45165,23349,35641,409,293,460,4618,13,27058,14707,60946,265,4068,39043,513,39904,11,19443,2439,3869,4140,315,47494,13,46706,1208,47528,11,3900,379,264,26633,1647,5919,13,445,22827,1069,455,69328,1370,3625,32118,99906,15572,38647,64347,82,11,326,49455,265,1370,1208,8431,8082,13,2009,16968,19266,1768,978,1370,653,23401,15844,593,8309,5019,1760,978,1414,1208,8431,8082,13,46706,15265,2942,44618,11,272,17771,514,27584,82660,3527,13,1219,2727,3625,15572,38647,64347,82,7930,3057,331,306,3930,8309,5019,326,6,33019,16339,11,3625,293,533,978,4108,69003,306,8065,53052,409,1208,1370,6870,409,15265,39408,258,1880,274,59858,1046,299,331,306,13,356,17771,3846,7930,11412,2605,78,16339,3625,7643,2249,409,10594,265,13,393,556,11,3625,293,533,978,4108,9765,462,17187,409,86696,6216,1900,2107,4893,409,30517,261,514,8309,13,24703,15132,3625,41569,1572,13,39783,37291,1208,1370,6870,39408,258,1604,16953,648,11,27750,41569,1572,513,38831,283,688,7010,514,29340,13,19421,39015,11,272,17771,1208,4160,648,55342,1604,5019,93381,71933,3625,2942,288,13,19438,3625,90518,1880,514,272,5976,2933,5019,2605,78,16339,1672,1386,285,685,9517,77,1604,1880,35665,18247,848,8467,13,34447,6502,409,7363,2428,13,2009,8309,1826,1760,19395,978,1370,951,22641,288,13,46706,15265,2942,44618,11,272,17771,514,72601,4998,3928,12267,7930,264,3846,436,57332,409,6144,12844,13,445,1105,447,35329,85877,440,68,1208,30179,768,951,293,533,978,4108,1880,951,41569,1572,11,3900,54206,51854,22337,20243,2482,5019,326,6339,45973,326,52152,13421,13,445,31109,294,6,37907,274,53149,6853,514,40774,4223,451,294,6,1394,1295,13,1952,92215,514,93455,10253,22641,288,7930,1760,4558,16149,514,8309,13,81245,15132,2107,4893,409,259,8977,3625,15572,38647,64347,82,11,10071,6502,79380,31914,2492,5019,26725,3625,4046,4763,10670,13,1708,1105,5019,969,1188,12,8839,379,1370,43406,274,85217,97958,5636,81786,949,1611,1208,27584,76407,11,389,829,275,1744,514,40774,4223,451,294,6,1394,1295,9517,47348,514,13026,409,293,533,978,4108,1880,409,41569,1572,7010,326,55624,478,258,13,34447,3846,308,17771,6502,8657,285,519,5019,51913,2058,326,52152,13421,13,9589,57375,3284,39587,294,49963,12329,20662,22337,20243,1130,22299,89714,949,356,17771,1120,1133,1208,3488,3869,1208,88265,4864,52571,3869,75871,265,9952,7643,270,4558,325,13,27058,45602,11,503,57286,664,648,4068,514,40774,4223,451,294,6,1394,1295,945,275,1765,3625,293,533,978,4108,1880,3625,41569,1572,7010,326,55624,478,258,13,19421,3869,326,52152,4550,11,4864,296,55624,978,22550,10253,32118,4919,2191,288,42587,5512,1370,1208,293,533,35285,5019,31807,1601,8065,40774,4223,451,294,6,1394,1295,13,1708,1105,4502,22299,41091,11,9189,62299,3242,266,4167,409,47929,4502,1208,8431,8082,35737,829,12328,8047,6033,4502,514,40774,4223,451,294,6,1394,1295,5019,969,23761,42587,978,22299,89714,11,66651,45325,7010,45889,46415,3869,1208,1913,409,1208,80091,13,69327,96308,3869,1208,1913,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5992,1093,264,36815,315,264,8982,477,15864,922,264,3495,8712,0,5810,596,279,1495,449,1063,37666,323,9099,51479,311,1304,433,8831,311,1373,1473,9,9,3936,68063,20704,374,40991,25,578,16506,30241,469,9211,718,689,74110,4968,56771,2902,17060,269,4193,2428,304,4718,1357,478,483,198,198,334,83136,68063,510,14109,2595,9,9,1956,68063,5936,220,679,24,320,66463,279,2316,19813,311,279,4984,315,279,1620,3280,315,4140,315,47494,696,9,9,3246,1250,68063,198,198,2746,358,3371,499,430,433,596,5936,220,679,24,11,1148,656,499,1781,30,1472,3358,4762,2019,11,330,25797,11,10683,374,5108,11,20229,527,26139,11,323,5151,527,14545,18238,9135,1628,430,596,7041,1314,13,2030,757
