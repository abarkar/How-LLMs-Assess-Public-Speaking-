Awakened, your brain can power a 25-watt lamp. This could be a revelation for ecologists, but for my soul as a young neuroscientist, the goal is something else entirely. Playing with this electricity to find innovative therapies. For example, can we induce electrical activity to treat certain cerebral dysfunctions? Yes, that's what they call deep brain stimulation. This stimulation consists of implanting two electrodes inside the brain that will connect to a simulator that will continuously stimulate the brain electrically. A bit like a pacemaker for the heart. This technique is proposed particularly for patients with Parkinson's disease who experience side effects from medication. Yes, or electroshocks. It's worthy of a science fiction film, but it's not devoid of risk. After several years, this stimulation also causes side effects such as gait and balance disorders. Continuous stimulation in Parkinsonian patients is not adapted to their daily life. To put it simply, it's like driving at 130 km/h on any type of road. In normal circumstances, you adapt your speed to the type of road and the route taken. Forgive me. And the route taken. To avoid these discomforts, we need to find a targeted electrical activity. I mean that the stimulation should be precise and active in the stimulation. Pardon. Let me start again. So, we need to find a targeted electrical activity. I recorded the electrical activity of 54 patients in a specific region, which is the subthalamic nucleus. I was interested in several parameters of this activity, frequency and power for each of these patients. And then, I faced several obstacles, notably that the frequency and power were very variable. It's very variable among these patients. But I persisted for three years, and I found that the activity was linked to symptoms and side effects. And that's a stone that will allow us to create personalized stimulation in the near future for patients who will be able to adapt their pace to the joy of life.**","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,20680,74466,45325,1744,15265,272,5976,2933,34501,818,1370,514,293,57567,409,326,31769,47262,13109,949,29124,588,484,978,11,15265,272,5976,2933,25692,453,318,1992,6316,23598,283,273,409,220,914,72122,13,356,8458,92215,23761,6316,9517,52274,2354,5019,3625,91329,16549,288,11,10071,5019,1647,29005,2727,409,36963,18247,56447,52760,11,326,6,1735,333,1826,16968,47838,13,97148,261,9952,20662,4046,47262,13109,5019,46524,951,76680,4714,552,9721,15844,13,4366,51173,11,92215,10539,4507,556,6316,4197,13109,98151,34395,5019,18027,261,76076,22709,22188,407,77,3808,272,68862,14720,2249,949,507,2005,11,272,17771,3846,934,54386,917,6853,1208,41959,272,68862,14720,273,2848,17675,13,62408,41959,6824,68,665,326,6,6517,519,367,409,26633,98151,299,5919,3869,326,55624,57663,3930,272,5976,2933,7930,82133,96586,4667,261,653,38553,324,7930,11412,96586,12936,8646,98151,462,447,1133,665,16513,514,272,5976,2933,13,1252,28800,22299,3869,326,6,6442,277,294,22827,23744,59775,5019,514,272,89412,13,62408,15105,1826,10045,8047,81186,46206,3625,6978,93381,21719,409,1208,8811,329,648,409,62145,5019,3625,447,2053,514,89714,35030,52777,2249,2605,61652,951,3369,1441,2132,17724,13,507,2005,11,6033,3625,98151,28787,2142,13,356,17771,294,19388,294,22827,4632,409,8198,74531,11,10071,3846,308,17771,6502,7591,9110,978,409,10025,593,13,5186,12416,45889,65838,11,20662,41959,2605,61652,44767,951,3369,1441,2132,17724,22299,951,35665,409,1208,15572,68,6033,409,326,31769,447,31059,265,13,5034,41959,665,16513,46206,3625,6978,6246,29973,80463,308,17771,6502,10737,8047,3869,28130,99568,3675,13,362,64160,409,7809,57288,11,272,17771,653,28800,22299,4502,9189,436,11206,74466,665,16513,3869,220,5894,13437,71,1765,308,6,94896,26077,955,409,6149,13,2998,27138,4725,11,9189,39732,668,89,15265,348,87960,8065,955,409,6149,11,1880,3869,1208,6149,991,652,3935,8047,13,393,46396,13,19421,3869,1208,6149,991,652,3935,8047,13,27058,51913,2058,27750,46838,351,43711,1392,11,3900,2267,664,14687,46524,6316,4197,13109,98151,34395,272,1260,13,14465,296,6,30992,2428,13,7695,2267,664,14687,1744,1208,41959,45441,51625,1082,1880,934,80720,45441,4642,7010,1208,41959,13,393,46396,13,14465,91507,312,59976,265,11083,1560,652,1220,13,1708,41881,13,4418,66,11,3900,47090,46524,6316,4197,13109,98151,34395,272,1260,13,622,34155,665,49564,978,326,6,9035,13109,98151,34395,46206,220,4370,6978,7010,6316,88100,14707,51625,1082,11,7930,1826,514,912,88,2933,32592,7716,17243,2428,13,14465,757,36731,92759,8047,3869,51854,1719,75104,409,20662,4197,13109,11,1208,1448,978,4474,1880,1208,18757,24918,5019,95917,359,409,27750,6978,13,19421,39015,11,4864,757,36731,17302,8047,3869,51854,32116,11,81186,1208,1448,978,4474,1880,1208,18757,24918,97958,25945,4244,5512,13,356,17771,25945,3977,46206,27750,6978,13,34447,503,34155,7565,118904,68862,42844,56321,8261,11,1880,503,34155,100162,1744,326,6,9035,13109,43989,908,8047,10253,12104,9769,9004,951,3369,1441,2132,17724,13,19421,272,17771,6316,22710,265,7930,11412,29557,10367,409,75831,6316,41959,97252,35965,8047,7010,653,18111,324,463,1557,5019,3625,6978,7930,82133,68226,513,5534,7420,3869,6316,348,87960,10737,8047,1765,514,7364,3930,7970,383,324,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,8586,374,279,25548,36815,1473,9,9,7131,499,1440,430,701,8271,4375,1555,18200,30,18371,3448,291,11,701,8271,649,2410,264,220,914,2695,1617,29062,13,1115,1436,387,264,40010,369,12208,22012,11,719,369,856,13836,439,264,3995,18247,56447,380,11,279,5915,374,2555,775,11622,13,40551,449,420,18200,311,1505,18699,52312,13,1789,3187,11,649,584,49853,20314,5820,311,4322,3738,60745,22709,22124,30,7566,11,430,596,1148,814,1650,5655,8271,41959,13,1115,41959,17610,315,46460,287,1403,80390,4871,279,8271,430,690,4667,311,264,42991,430,690,31978,51077,279,8271,9249,750,13,362,2766,1093,264,23744,59775,369,279,4851,13,1115,15105,374,11223,8104,369,6978,449,62145,596,8624,889,3217,3185,6372,505,24099,13,7566,11,477,25396,939,26246,13,1102,596,28390,315,264,8198,17422,4632,11,719,433,596,539,76939,315,5326,13,4740,3892,1667,11,420,41959,1101,11384,3185,6372,1778,439,342,1339,323,8335,24673,13,70067,41959,304,62145,1122,6978,374,539,30464,311,872,7446,2324,13,2057,2231,433,5042,11,433,596,1093,10043,520,220,5894,13437,7682,389,904,955,315,5754,13,763,4725,13463,11,499,10737,701,4732,311,279,955,315,5754,323,279,6149,4529,13,1789,47530,757,13,1628,279,6149,4529,13,2057,5766,1521,44776,82,11,584,1205,311,1505,264,17550,20314,5820,13,358,3152,430,279,41959,1288,387,24473,323,4642,304,279,41959,13,393,46396,13,6914,757,1212,1578,13,2100,11,584,1205,311,1505,264,17550,20314,5820,13,358,12715,279,20314,5820,315,220,4370,6978,304,264,3230,5654,11,902,374,279,1207,31392,4079,62607,13,358,574,8173,304,3892,5137,315,420,5820,11,11900,323,2410,369,1855,315,1521,6978,13,1628,1243,11,358,17011,3892,32116,11,35146,430,279,11900,323,2410,1051,1633,3977,13,1102,596,1633,3977,4315,1521,6978,13,2030,358,54095,369,2380,16
