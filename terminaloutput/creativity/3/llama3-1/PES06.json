The speaker explains that carbon monoxide is a highly toxic gas that can cause severe respiratory distress, coma, and even death, and that there are over 3,000 cases of carbon monoxide poisoning in France each year.\n\nThe speaker notes that carbon monoxide is invisible, odorless, and tasteless, making it difficult to detect. They explain that the gas works by binding to a protein called myoglobin in the muscles, preventing oxygen from reaching the tissues.\n\nThe speaker then discusses how they used mathematical modeling to study the interaction between carbon monoxide molecules and myoglobin. They used computer simulations to model the behavior of carbon monoxide molecules as they bind to myoglobin, and found that the molecules can take a long time to find a path out of the protein's \"labyrinthine\" structure.\n\nThe speaker notes that this finding has implications for the study of other physical systems, and that mathematical modeling can be used to better understand the world around us. They conclude by thanking their audience.\n\nHere is a rough translation:\n\n\"In France, we see over 3,000 cases of carbon monoxide poisoning each year, with over 100 deaths resulting from these intoxications. Preventing this phenomenon is particularly complex because this gas, in addition to being invisible, is odorless and tasteless. To establish effective treatments, it's also important to understand precisely how this seemingly harmless gas acts on our organism. The first answer lies in our respiratory mechanism. Oxygen that we breathe is transported through the blood to a protein called myoglobin, which stores and redistributes oxygen to muscle tissues. And that's where our 'criminal' gas intervenes. It takes the place of oxygen at this protein, disrupting the supply of oxygen to muscles, and our organism can no longer survive.\n\nMore precisely, carbon monoxide binds to an atom located at the center of the protein, which is represented on the visual aid accompanying me. You can see this protein like a complex labyrinth with the binding atom at its center.\n\nTo study this phenomenon more deeply, it's important to be able to simulate it, for example on a computer. To do so, we use mathematical models that will describe the interaction between the carbon monoxide molecule and the protein. We then realize that the structure of the protein and therefore the contours of this labyrinth change over time. As for the carbon monoxide molecule, once it's in this labyrinth, it heads towards the center, where it will try to bind to an atom. And when it reaches a dead end, it simply waits for a change in the labyrinth configuration to find a new path.\n\nWell, you might say. Only, these openings can take a very long time before appearing, typically after millions of iterations on our algorithm. During this time, the molecule remains stuck in the labyrinth and researchers get impatient in front of their computers.\n\nMy thesis work consists of proving that there is a way to simulate these appearances of paths much faster. I say that if my molecule stays stuck in this labyrinth long enough, it forgets its entire past trajectory. I can then find a way to simulate its future trajectory on multiple processors in parallel, which will allow me to significantly reduce the simulation time.\n\nBeyond this public health issue, there are actually many other physical systems where these results could be used. Like how mathematics, no matter how abstract they may seem, can help us better understand the world we live in.

you.\"","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,2998,9822,11,389,42463,46777,76132,5636,409,220,18,931,72815,811,8065,40774,4223,451,409,1841,20337,11,15890,6316,2960,8511,409,35881,12416,951,56264,409,27750,72815,811,13,5034,27389,7611,409,3846,1343,98078,48099,1826,54008,67882,6485,68,11,1841,3846,56086,11,665,5636,294,93825,30547,11,1826,304,68565,1880,1280,337,461,13,362,5589,294,31769,74199,404,951,9781,1224,812,1008,978,447,1900,11,3900,1826,44767,3062,409,60946,265,51625,285,42625,4068,3846,56086,294,53149,69777,304,1885,4114,945,275,1765,29449,2942,44618,13,39783,55133,90509,513,71451,7010,29449,32118,4919,44618,409,594,29579,13,445,6,61263,70,48099,1744,17317,33515,2439,1826,264,2464,258,978,3869,30517,514,29340,55398,81991,6316,1760,978,483,76190,8047,856,76525,483,7930,5708,68,1880,8873,361,42067,99690,70,48099,5553,3625,259,1056,355,3167,3395,17724,13,19421,14707,272,17771,39015,934,55624,651,1188,29449,56086,86032,30808,13,7695,274,69537,391,548,1208,2035,409,326,6,61263,70,48099,46206,20662,1760,978,483,11,18713,9225,519,44351,326,6,391,403,294,6,61263,70,48099,5553,3625,24569,1880,29449,2942,44618,308,6,1138,535,5636,3869,5258,1601,13,12623,51625,285,42625,11,514,40774,4223,451,409,1841,20337,513,5155,68,3869,653,520,638,10109,978,8065,12541,409,1208,1760,978,483,11,7930,1826,294,6,52009,1759,91678,978,1765,514,2145,4088,7930,296,6,582,5807,24812,13,41621,45366,46131,20662,1760,978,483,22299,653,326,58437,1820,6485,68,8065,12541,3930,43014,29059,635,326,6,266,638,908,519,13,362,5589,294,57286,664,1291,3846,1343,98078,48099,409,83199,5636,665,2848,17675,324,11,3900,1826,3062,409,68226,514,1675,8646,11,1370,51173,1765,6141,3357,324,13,27058,45602,11,389,20272,76190,3869,951,1491,85798,7033,978,8637,8467,7930,82133,7591,68019,326,6,69175,9465,1208,22337,20243,1130,409,1647,62868,606,1880,1208,1760,978,483,13,1952,513,17634,42463,45575,409,1208,14896,46932,5048,13,5034,6070,409,1208,1760,978,483,1880,39587,3625,50131,409,3846,326,58437,1820,30870,16149,9952,514,27138,13,32541,3869,1208,22337,20243,1130,409,40774,4223,451,409,1841,20337,11,6316,37291,7010,3846,326,58437,1820,11,27549,513,5534,7404,665,5216,3930,12541,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,409,326,6,266,638,1765,514,43014,27549,11412,259,1992,409,513,5155,261,13,19421,37953,447,80720,17782,3869,6316,3242,13559,11,27549,9604,71357,653,2609,1133,409,6683,3930,326,58437,1820,5019,68226,513,1448,1155,3869,653,43453,88768,13,1183,12416,14707,11,757,13510,89,45325,13,1369,84,1001,11,27750,6033,1653,1439,56311,59394,653,27138,25945,1317,33670,294,53149,5169,66014,11,3666,81235,8065,25646,409,11990,294,6,13109,81,811,1765,29449,453,6191,2727,13,81501,3846,27138,2922,6496,11,1208,22337,20243,1130,66167,14545,447,8047,7010,514,326,58437,1820,1880,3625,52571,1759,274,98279,23557,306,77558,28130,6141,3357,324,13,3206,42775,409,270,4558,325,6824,68,45575,3869,550,15170,934,35329,29253,653,91116,14707,5636,76608,409,1675,8646,27750,34388,6055,409,88768,13,14465,834,1744,4502,7643,22337,20243,1130,66167,8657,285,64656,1317,67380,14545,447,8047,7010,3846,326,58437,1820,11,27549,6033,2067,648,43905,829,9781,585,42827,1522,8047,13,14465,94297,45575,46524,653,91116,409,1675,8646,1208,9781,585,42827,3938,1765,51854,29394,325,1759,665,1370,543,51453,11,3846,7930,11412,757,29557,10367,409,9517,1072,556,409,85722,4698,1413,514,27138,409,19576,13,33150,48226,6496,409,20662,3488,409,77323,6814,37526,11,3900,29253,665,20272,14707,294,81979,42345,66474,4571,8467,1765,3625,447,2053,27750,100246,5019,969,1188,23761,42587,5512,13,1219,2727,75249,3625,7033,978,8637,8467,11,28463,671,496,1339,288,779,1188,12,37907,11,56311,17317,29557,10367,409,64972,60946,265,514,38900,7010,514,43014,17317,18434,2439,13,14465,9189,312,1195,25134,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,32,36815,315,264,8982,922,12782,1647,55189,52236,323,279,1005,315,37072,34579,311,4007,279,16628,1990,12782,1647,55189,35715,323,28896,304,279,2547,13,578,19114,15100,430,12782,1647,55189,374,264,7701,21503,6962,430,649,5353,15748,42631,35104,11,70398,11,323,1524,4648,11,323,430,1070,527,927,220,18,11,931,5157,315,12782,1647,55189,52236,304,9822,1855,1060,627,198,791,19114,8554,430,12782,1647,55189,374,30547,11,54097,1752,11,323,12945,1752,11,3339,433,5107,311,11388,13,2435,10552,430,279,6962,4375,555,11212,311,264,13128,2663,856,94855,304,279,24569,11,27252,24463,505,19261,279,39881,627,198,791,19114,1243,35434,1268,814,1511,37072,34579,311,4007,279,16628,1990,12782,1647,55189,35715,323,856,94855,13,2435,1511,6500,47590,311,1646,279,7865,315,12782,1647,55189,35715,439,814,10950,311,856,94855,11,323,1766,430,279,35715,649,1935,264,1317,892,311,1505,264,1853,704,315,279,13128,596,330,75,62630,483,1,6070,627,198,791,19114,8554,430,420,9455,706,25127,369,279,4007,315,1023,7106,6067,11,323,430,37072,34579,649,387,1511,311,2731,3619,279,1917,2212,603,13,2435,32194,555,94121,872,10877,627,198,8586,374,264,11413,14807,1473,33703,9822,11,584,1518,927,220,1
