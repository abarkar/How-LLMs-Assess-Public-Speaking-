They share their process for collecting and testing different types of soil and hemp fibers, and how they used this data to create a simple test that can be used on construction sites to determine which materials and quantities are needed to achieve the desired performance.\n\nHere is a rough translation of the transcript:\n\n\"Remember, kids, the little mud cakes at the beach? Well, I've done my part. I spend half my days, with my hands in the mud, making little mud cakes. And I measure them precisely. My research consists of characterizing an ideal thermal insulation material for buildings. It has to be the most ecological and performant possible. You can make it almost anywhere on Earth, using only three ingredients that you'll always find locally. It produces no waste, stores a lot of carbon, and plus, you can recycle it endlessly. It's incredible! To figure out what it is, let's play a game for a builder. Okay, first ingredient. Top! What ancestral building material, found both in the Great Wall of China and Château de Vosgérard, is simple but very complex because it's very variable? Yes, raw earth. In my research, I study it at different scales to determine its components, especially clay. Fantastic natural adhesive. Okay, second ingredient. Top! What plant, whose fibers were used to make the ropes of the largest ships, has a cousin that is illegally smoked? Yes, hemp. Inside the stem, you'll find small particles resembling wood, very light because they're full of porosity. That's what will bring the insulating power. The trick is that there are at least as many hemp plants as wheat fields. So to differentiate them, I study the size of the particles and their ability to absorb water. Mixed with our third ingredient, water, we get what's called a lightened earth. Now, how do you study the performance of this lightened earth without making billions of mixes, but taking into account this amazing diversity? Well, I who love to play, made a bet. I took my boots and shovel, and I went through all of Brittany and Normandy, not to reconcile them, but to collect 30 soils that I unfolded at the surface, according to a precise protocol to determine their behavior, depending on their water content. I ended up with little mud cakes again. But the difference is that I did lab tests to exactly express why my little mud cake holds or doesn't hold. Added to the data from hemp producers, I have what it takes to choose soils and hemp plants with very different behaviors. And there you go! I end up with 5 soils representative of all of Western France and 3 hemp plants representative of all of France. With my chosen soils and hemp plants, I make mixes, then study their performances. Impeccable mechanical tenacity, top insulating power, and incredible humidity management. To ensure the use of my research, my project is carried out in the framework of participatory research. It includes artisans, among others. So to finish, cherry on top, I am currently working on developing a simple test that will allow you to determine which materials and quantities should be used to guarantee these performances. Raw earth and plant fibers are ancient building materials. But studying them teaches us one thing. Diversity is a fantastic tool for building the future.\"\n\nLet me know if you'd like me to clarify or translate anything
