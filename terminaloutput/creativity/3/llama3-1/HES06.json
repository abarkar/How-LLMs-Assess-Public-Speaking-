During one of these interviews, I met Frédéric, a buyer, who told me about the saga of an information software. Frédéric was tasked with purchasing a new software for the commercial service. A supplier offered him 80,000 euros, while another offered 100,000 euros. Despite equal services, Frédéric chose the one offering 80,000 euros, thinking he was making a good deal. However, what Frédéric didn't expect was the complexity of the software that forced sales representatives to spend hours on technical support. This led to missed appointments and lost revenue, causing stress, absenteeism, and other issues. Frédéric had not anticipated this. It's not something that is typically considered in software development or procurement tools.\n\nMy thesis aims to change this situation by building a model that can identify both visible and hidden costs. I'm doing this within an enterprise, within a procurement service, using a calimetric research-intervention methodology based on the socio-economic model developed by Professors Saval, Zardé, Capelletti, and other researchers at the ISÉOR.\n\nI question buyers, procurement managers, and users, explaining my approach to them. I collect qualitative, quantitative, and financial information and analyze it with my laboratory, LIRSA, to build the model. With this model, an innovative company will have a first-of-its-kind tool capable of identifying impacts on working conditions and organizational work. I even see further into the future: a socio-economic model that will be implemented in all companies, all procurement services. Thousands of Frédérics who can identify the impact on working conditions and organization from the moment of purchase. And don't you think this will change the way people live at work?","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,46706,514,60697,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,296,48099,951,1218,2171,80463,98544,81,12416,294,6,613,7870,1759,1880,409,4294,4893,34361,1900,13,33150,45369,294,22827,409,27750,1218,2171,80463,11,503,34155,66283,978,2939,15433,39965,11,653,34361,7870,324,11,1880,3900,296,26248,15473,778,978,3846,7930,25400,1826,69003,978,13,5034,47403,3930,1515,78493,51307,2428,13,2939,15433,39965,264,24560,5714,978,294,6,613,1430,514,43453,1515,78493,5019,514,2532,8518,13,1252,81994,74608,25400,10045,1339,220,1490,220,931,33588,11,653,47838,81994,74608,25400,10045,1339,220,1041,220,931,33588,13,362,864,20762,4046,70,1604,11,2939,15433,39965,264,2665,13532,66090,7930,25400,10045,1339,220,1490,220,931,33588,13,7695,23423,1339,20028,6316,51651,3611,12267,13,34447,3846,1744,2939,15433,39965,308,49152,1339,6502,27389,46790,11,272,17771,1208,6485,13109,3930,1515,78493,7930,1536,53890,3625,95194,83391,3869,2800,261,951,76145,9952,514,328,8253,13,24703,15132,3625,98233,7930,841,274,98279,652,3904,6502,1880,7930,3381,31632,3625,8403,13,356,17771,1208,281,14140,409,84064,265,294,82405,17724,7930,78422,12339,3930,8631,11,951,2961,5615,2641,8811,329,648,11,1880,503,41901,39904,13,2939,15433,39965,308,49152,1339,6502,27389,46790,39043,13,4366,346,1744,39043,11,3846,308,17771,6502,27389,46790,7010,3625,1515,3457,2053,1880,3625,704,8839,951,34361,1900,13,19421,665,5636,11,272,17771,25945,77411,3869,523,333,1658,261,13,1708,1105,4068,62439,3625,79165,949,61651,14707,11,272,17771,39043,326,6,67816,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,14465,19477,9425,653,83597,13171,294,6,16288,3625,1080,30872,2641,2145,21041,1880,3625,1080,30872,2641,61387,5512,13,19421,4864,19477,9425,3846,83597,7010,6316,93486,11,8065,19910,294,22827,2532,264,9884,11,9952,6316,75601,347,38469,409,38317,20653,47698,1652,318,978,376,2428,11,665,296,53149,4168,519,1765,514,83597,41589,12,978,45317,2428,68866,978,1370,3625,2848,24201,1759,20680,278,11,1901,569,978,11,8171,301,1169,10462,11,1880,3625,46106,52571,1759,409,326,6,1669,27887,878,13,14465,9189,3327,2428,13,622,6,2295,299,713,951,34361,7870,1759,11,951,4294,4893,294,6,97264,11,951,42587,36306,13,19421,4864,3625,3327,2428,13,14465,3625,3327,2428,13,14465,3625,3327,2428,13,14465,3625,3327,2428,13,14465,3625,3327,2428,13,14465,3625,3327,2428,13,14465,3625,3327,2428,13,14465,3625,3327,2428,13,14465,3625,3327,2428,13,14465,3625,3327,2428,13,14465,28130,62163,1880,4864,6667,68,951,44827,5965,275,5983,11,10484,275,5983,11,41645,59307,13,622,6,44803,325,9952,1647,9511,67763,11,514,445,2871,7934,11,5019,19477,52750,1647,83597,13,2895,66096,3869,3846,83597,11,20662,93486,9721,5048,11412,834,20672,3930,21134,704,321,13171,294,6,16288,3625,25949,1765,3625,4787,409,42775,1880,1765,326,6,58904,3930,42775,13,19421,4864,100164,27584,5636,78060,7010,326,6,5389,404,13,14465,100164,653,83597,41589,12,978,45317,2428,274,6,6517,519,519,7010,40744,3625,97263,11,7010,26725,3625,3600,294,6,97264,13,3959,2606,4918,409,2939,15433,978,6329,2107,4893,294,6,16288,11,87451,326,6,533,68,294,6,97264,11,326,6,58400,1765,3625,4787,409,42775,1880,1765,326,6,58904,13,19421,39043,11,9189,841,26483,19610,6502,1744,39043,11412,62439,3625,4787,409,17536,8065,42775,949,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,8586,374,264,3284,10824,315,279,1495,512,198,2170,961,315,856,17850,11,358,6929,19905,449,23455,323,53678,20258,13,12220,832,315,1521,19905,11,358,2322,2939,15433,39965,11,264,26171,11,889,3309,757,922,279,47403,315,459,2038,3241,13,2939,15433,39965,574,51920,449,23395,264,502,3241,369,279,8518,2532,13,362,19353,9076,1461,220,1490,11,931,33588,11,1418,2500,9076,220,1041,11,931,33588,13,18185,6273,3600,11,2939,15433,39965,14896,279,832,10209,220,1490,11,931,33588,11,7422,568,574,3339,264,1695,3568,13,4452,11,1148,2939,15433,39965,3287,956,1755,574,279,23965,315,279,3241,430,9770,6763,24005,311,8493,4207,389,11156,1862,13,1115,6197,311,13942,37256,323,5675,13254,11,14718,8631,11,94190,2191,11,323,1023,4819,13,2939,15433,39965,1047,539,30199,420,13,1102,596,539,2555,430,374,11383,6646,304,3241,4500,477,53678,7526,627,198,5159,17850,22262,311,2349,420,6671,555,4857,264,1646,430,649,10765,2225,9621,323,8340,7194,13,358,2846,3815,420,2949,459,20790,11,2949,264,53678,2532,11,1701,264,1652,318,16743,3495,20653,47698,38152,3196,389,279,41589,77249,1646,8040,555,8626,434,1105,20680,278,11,1901,569,978,11,8171,301,1169,10462,11,323,1023,12074,520,279,3507,27887,878,627,198,40,3488,23455,11,53678,20258,11,323,3932,11,26073,856,5603,311,1124,13,358,6667,62129,11,47616,11,323,6020,2038,323,24564,433,449,856,27692,11,445,2871,7934,11,311,1977,279,1646,13,3161,420,1646,11,459,18699,2883,690,617,264,1176,8838,12,1220,60806,5507,13171,315,25607,25949,389,3318,4787,323,41295,990,13,358,1524,1518,4726,1139,279,3938,25,264,41589,77249,1646,430,690,387,11798,304,682,5220,11,682,53678,3600,13,63294,315,2939,15433,978,6329,889,649,10765,279,5536,389,3318,4787,323,7471,505,279,4545,315
