It appears to be a lecture or presentation on the importance of air quality and pollution reduction, with a focus on the thesis research of the speaker.\n\nHere's a summary:\n\nThe speaker asks what is the most vital need for all living beings that we often take for granted. They argue that it's not eating, sleeping, but rather breathing pure air. The statistics are alarming: every year, air pollution causes 7 million deaths worldwide, more than the combined number of deaths from tuberculosis, diabetes, and road accidents.\n\nThe speaker emphasizes the importance of knowing the sources of atmospheric pollutants to develop strategies for reducing emissions. They introduce their thesis research as aiming to identify these sources and understand how pollutants evolve over time.\n\nUsing a simple example about grouping people born in a specific geographic area, the speaker illustrates how they approach identifying the origins of pollutants by analyzing data using specialized tools. Just as people from different families share a common origin when born in Auvergne, the speaker seeks to determine the \"histories\" or sources of pollutants and understand how they change over time.\n\nThe speaker highlights that just as some people may have traveled hundreds or thousands of kilometers to reach Auvergne, pollutants can also travel great distances and pollute other areas. They also mention the concept of \"baby pollutants,\" which are secondary pollutants created through chemical reactions in the atmosphere and can be even more harmful than their parents.\n\nThe presentation concludes by emphasizing that air pollution is not only detrimental to human health but also has negative impacts on the environment and climate. The speaker encourages the audience to take small steps towards improving air quality, such as watching a video next week, and invites them to reflect on what they can do personally to improve the air they breathe.\n\nWhat an engaging and informative
