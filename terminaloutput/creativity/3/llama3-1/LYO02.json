The speaker seems to be exploring how our brains process information, memories, and experiences, and how we can better understand ourselves.\n\nThe text mentions Alzheimer's disease as an example of how people with the condition struggle to reorient themselves due to impaired cognitive function. In contrast, the speaker is trying to understand how we navigate our own existence, which is characterized by fragmented experiences and memories that intersect and overlap throughout time.\n\nThe presentation also touches on the idea of \"continuit√©s\" or threads that run through our lives, connecting different events, people, and experiences. The speaker seems to be using video games as a metaphor for this concept, where participants play multiple games that represent different \"lives\" or continuities. By manipulating parameters and measuring participant responses, the speaker aims to understand how we adapt to changes, remember past events, and perceive time.\n\nThe overall goal appears to be to better grasp how our brains function, with the potential benefits including improved life management, creativity, and mental health understanding. The speaker acknowledges that it's not necessary to comprehend how we function in order to live and thrive, but suggests that gaining insight into our cognitive processes can lead to new possibilities and a deeper appreciation for the complexities of human existence.\n\nWhat do you think about this
