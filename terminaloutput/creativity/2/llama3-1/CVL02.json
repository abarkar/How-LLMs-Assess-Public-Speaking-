I myself have lost some comrades, and perhaps you too. I am thinking in particular of the young foals who lived on the farm next to my parents' house when I was younger, and unfortunately did not survive. In this war, we have a common enemy - humans, animals, whether terrestrial or marine, insects, birds, and even plants. This common enemy is the parasitic worm. Parasitic worms are everywhere and come in all sizes. Some are microscopic and live in soil, and those are very good for the environment. On the other hand, others are very nasty and parasitize almost all living species on this planet. In humans, one person out of two is infested or has been infested. So look at your neighbor to your left, your neighbor to your right. If it's not you, it may be your neighbor who is infested. I can't take care of all the parasites that exist on this earth, so I will focus on the one that traumatized me as a child - the worm that affects horses and causes respiratory and digestive problems that can lead to animal death. We do have an arm against this worm - ivermectin. Ivermectin was commercialized in the 1980s, which means it's been around for 40 years. And that's where the problem is. Just like with antibiotics and bacteria, worms have developed resistances to this molecule. That's where I come in. The goal of my thesis is to understand how ivermectin works on this parasite, because we still don't know after 40 years, and to understand the mechanisms of resistance involved against this molecule to develop new strategies for fighting it. So we do have some leads. We know that ivermectin acts on the nervous system of the parasite, specifically on receptors. These receptors are composed of five subunits, like five fingers, and allow a nerve signal to pass or not depending on whether the receptor opens or closes. The worm has an idea - move, eat, reproduce. The idea passes through this receptor and leads to action - eating, moving, reproducing. Ivermectin, on the other hand, will bind to this receptor and prevent the worm from realizing its actions. So the worm is paralyzed and dies. But if the worm is resistant, ivermectin won't be able to bind to the receptor, and the worm will live freely in the horse. The goal of my thesis is already to identify these receptors and find the right subunit composition so that the receptor is functional, and then study the interactions between this receptor and ivermectin, the molecule used to treat this parasite. In a second stage, I will focus on the mutations of resistance that exist on this receptor to develop a new strategy and bypass the resistance. So you can count on me - I'll give it my all to save the foals.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,4241,9425,1208,85434,951,27138,11,3900,29253,6316,1709,67100,513,5192,66522,7930,264,46939,20272,951,11990,409,10237,82,13,622,34155,41091,98375,824,1072,76076,83491,2439,11,1880,15878,294,2182,1744,9189,28463,13,14465,73953,81186,10253,60120,281,11206,1771,7930,348,10126,1188,7010,1208,18728,2727,3869,81337,409,46206,11083,6699,11,42676,503,31769,2629,285,5636,36963,11,1880,7930,308,6,546,8811,75876,43765,6502,7550,20243,84,13,46706,20662,1709,67100,11,17317,57038,653,61624,22530,34561,13,48109,11,3625,2854,1771,11,10071,44767,3625,4039,12249,11,934,85217,779,1188,2024,4014,417,6033,3678,1354,11,9952,3625,27080,288,11,3625,297,1082,12249,11,1880,27584,3625,348,19395,978,2629,2249,13,356,295,61624,22530,34561,11,272,17771,514,2807,85573,13,11876,5553,79383,15132,961,412,1880,15132,409,40744,9986,645,13,15663,1771,15132,8162,2445,454,8467,1880,18434,306,7010,514,2092,11,1880,66056,2922,6496,15132,25945,14707,5019,326,41901,2842,40280,13,2998,5891,29097,11,294,81979,15132,25945,32118,99906,1880,33403,275,306,934,300,3904,40744,3625,16948,4558,1634,18434,15844,1765,20662,3197,66522,13,8602,89,326,6,87713,11,6316,54613,1765,26633,1826,4225,478,8047,6033,264,24560,4225,478,8047,13,4418,66,1239,42441,89,15265,4160,58504,3869,15265,96721,11,15265,4160,58504,3869,15265,7118,635,13,12095,3846,308,17771,6502,9189,11,272,17771,25692,85815,15265,4160,58504,7930,1826,4225,478,978,13,14465,841,94297,6502,296,6,14310,3550,409,26725,3625,79383,7930,3073,306,1765,20662,88026,11,39587,4864,91507,757,17576,261,1765,66090,3930,3091,838,7930,296,26248,9781,372,3689,978,7010,1647,33632,685,13,24703,5553,11,46206,514,3091,838,11,83786,25108,818,951,35665,33515,4428,3946,1880,21552,22589,1880,25692,83786,25108,1215,1208,10237,409,326,6,48999,13,1952,264,42676,27584,6316,802,2727,45973,3846,5553,11,6316,22337,20243,1130,7930,274,53149,6853,326,6,1553,76,440,483,13,445,6,1553,76,440,483,264,24560,8518,285,8047,7010,3625,65838,220,1490,11,39587,3900,379,264,220,1272,8261,13,19421,272,17771,39015,39723,1826,514,80259,13,356,17771,1744,41199,11,22299,5019,3625,33209,8467,1880,3625,293,533,978,4108,11,3625,5553,14848,68866,978,951,31807,380,3095,3869,20662,22337,20243,1130,13,19421,272,17771,39015,39723,503,6,40997,665,51655,13,2009,719,409,7643,270,4558,325,1826,409,60946,265,4068,326,6,1553,76,440,483,34501,818,1765,3846,85573,11,66021,934,54386,841,514,829,275,44093,6502,3869,326,6,75876,1180,31037,11,27584,42138,220,1272,8261,11,1880,409,60946,265,3625,32118,4919,2191,288,409,31807,4011,11866,5118,5512,45973,20662,22337,20243,1130,5019,52895,716,409,80080,44397,19395,552,409,63922,668,13,4418,66,389,264,42676,27584,45889,24817,288,13,1952,829,275,1744,326,6,1553,76,440,483,945,275,1765,514,72601,32015,2249,3930,85573,11,39587,4538,272,5976,2933,11,1880,5636,51625,285,42625,1765,951,9517,1512,38647,13,62463,9517,1512,38647,15132,40321,5512,409,272,6009,32592,61675,5512,11,22299,272,6009,656,343,2641,11,1880,29557,73468,514,21765,6033,6502,294,22827,1984,32015,2249,46932,519,1744,514,9517,1512,12844,274,6,283,49606,6033,513,18728,2727,13,4418,66,514,5553,85573,264,6316,887,8047,11,22299,30870,1414,11,296,4091,11,513,14843,556,13,445,27688,8047,39904,3869,30517,3846,9517,1512,12844,1880,83786,25108,818,326,91655,11,39587,296,4091,11,30870,1414,11,513,14843,556,13,445,6,1553,76,440,483,11,27549,11,11412,513,5155,261,1765,3846,9517,1512,12844,1880,8654,5615,9211,514,5553,409,59157,12329,40744,15907,6299,13,4418,66,514,5553,1826,1370,278,1065,978,1880,11412,67683,404,13,34447,4502,514,5553,1826,31807,11451,11,326,6,1553,76,440,483,841,5019,969,56316,513,5155,261,1765,514,9517,1512,12844,11,1880,3930,16081,514,5553,11412,18434,265,48647,479,11,7010,514,3091,838,13,4418,66,514,719,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,272,17771,46939,294,6,16288,27750,9517,1512,38647,1880,409,46524,1208,51651,18528,665,32592,61675,5512,5019,1744,3846,9517,1512,12844,45441,34501,8301,11,1880,3930,16081,14240,664,1291,3625,22639,409,3846,9517,1512,12844,9952,326,6,1553,76,440,483,11,1208,22337,20243,1130,7930,1826,11866,5118,8047,11,7930,1826,42587,8047,5019,18027,261,3846,85573,13,46706,653,26633,90272,27138,11,4864,91507,296,55624,978,676,261,10253,34684,409,31807,4011,934,35329,379,264,1765,3846,9517,1512,12844,5019,52895,716,6316,48659,44397,19395,648,1880,42533,1215,1208,31807,4011,13,4418,66,9189,45366,55056,261,1765,41091,11,5019,33254,424,3625,281,606,1065,11,4864,91507,16968,71751,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,8586,374,279,11093,1495,512,198,12834,14154,3115,11,1070,706,1027,264,6367,4208,430,706,2736,11922,11990,315,6439,13,358,7182,617,5675,1063,67128,11,323,8530,499,2288,13,358,1097,7422,304,4040,315,279,3995,12018,1147,889,12439,389,279,8961,1828,311,856,6699,6,3838,994,358,574,14992,11,323,26907,1550,539,18167,13,763,420,4208,11,584,617,264,4279,9354,482,12966,11,10099,11,3508,80492,477,29691,11,41911,11,20229,11,323,1524,11012,13,1115,4279,9
