The speaker explains that Comté is dependent on industry and currently dominated by energy production, which is concentrated in the hands of two powerful individuals: Alstorm, a magician, and General Electric, a general.\n\nThe author notes that the difficulties facing the energy sector have led to a series of problems, including the departure of magicians, the closure of breweries, and a lack of jobs for hobbits. The speaker argues that one way to break out of this vicious cycle is to diversify Comté's economy by developing new sectors.\n\nHowever, the author notes that there are several obstacles to overcome, including the legacy of heavy investments in industry, a strong industrial memory, and highly specialized hobbit skills. These factors make it difficult for Comté to change its trajectory and move forward.\n\nThe speaker proposes conducting a statistical cartography to diagnose the territory's difficulties and blockages, and then studying the assets and resources of Comté through interviews with hobbits. The goal is to understand how the community takes ownership of its destiny and how public policies can be used to engage the territory in a new scenario.\n\nOverall, the transcript appears to outline an exploratory research project that aims to identify the challenges facing Comté's industrial territory and explore potential solutions for moving forward.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,362,9832,77492,88253,11,5019,9189,3327,72684,514,70927,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,4864,91507,9189,15473,444,466,326,6,90446,64979,2428,294,22827,7317,6491,556,9047,22811,13,38891,89,1208,1219,123708,11,220,2636,8261,42138,1208,19814,409,326,6,20991,2933,13,4241,9425,11,3846,7317,6491,556,264,4635,84,1208,9517,65272,67965,6853,1880,74699,11,3625,5107,5512,409,326,6,485,592,7379,13,19421,272,17771,25945,52088,978,8637,2428,11,66021,1744,1120,1133,11,1208,1219,123708,1826,7591,3825,5048,409,326,6,485,592,7379,13,27058,23761,5636,51625,1082,11,1208,1219,123708,1826,1180,77776,11358,8047,1370,326,6,485,592,7379,409,326,31769,64374,1880,20662,9047,7379,1826,17576,8047,9465,3625,69236,3930,4983,3457,268,1708,27511,1880,3930,89175,98151,34395,11,26633,513,19388,1759,96308,92759,5512,1370,294,81979,38682,919,13,328,5757,412,1744,514,31237,12844,409,326,31769,64374,264,14707,2609,978,1880,1744,1208,3613,21201,1826,409,7287,17936,13,2009,5945,5979,11,272,17771,1744,27750,5107,5512,83786,25108,77,306,43905,6316,47528,294,81979,52088,66474,13,3959,4983,3457,729,7930,961,306,11,951,37138,4804,7930,68736,11,5636,79380,409,42775,5019,3625,69176,11777,13,2998,5636,11,26725,27750,33013,98942,308,19395,266,22589,513,5790,2000,1189,9465,84440,13,65381,31632,409,39015,11,4068,389,20272,5019,3460,404,3930,47562,273,32531,53819,949,445,31769,45317,17194,665,41091,11412,9189,13510,934,31109,48901,409,1208,6425,11,272,17771,1744,1208,1219,123708,71451,409,87325,31237,38647,3869,52895,716,1880,934,85217,25400,29557,73468,409,1375,11967,4538,82653,648,665,1208,21797,84554,13,34447,272,17771,39015,1744,39043,1080,1736,13,1611,326,414,5469,2793,15760,1392,1522,5512,11,6316,32118,97495,67965,6853,65058,11,951,69176,11777,10253,75332,2436,17508,76305,285,14014,11,39043,20272,1744,1208,16578,3930,48876,1826,4684,5118,8047,13,9648,55755,22011,11,1208,1219,123708,1826,14545,447,8047,7010,653,1156,10610,3370,13,1252,1156,10610,3370,7930,43989,47838,86633,20940,333,11,10071,7930,75804,88253,4751,483,7010,653,11957,6953,1355,582,13,6178,72,11,4864,5320,2249,60946,265,934,2053,15132,3625,33013,98942,7930,8654,5615,331,306,1208,1219,123708,409,21797,3125,4538,4197,13109,11,1880,3625,33013,98942,7930,11,8065,32150,556,11,5019,969,1188,326,26248,1814,3869,62439,409,9781,585,42827,13,27058,39043,11,4864,91507,294,6,370,541,1200,52424,653,15439,3930,7317,6491,556,77433,3869,6316,7558,3257,648,20719,2428,13,34447,4160,321,6496,11,6316,37291,934,54386,264,6316,11376,13509,1604,951,5107,5512,1880,951,41840,1154,3930,7317,6491,556,11,934,17771,54312,934,54386,20272,949,27058,75871,265,3869,20662,3488,11,4864,91507,14240,664,1291,3625,520,11934,1880,594,40751,409,1208,1219,123708,665,3026,519,951,1218,2171,80463,98544,81,12416,951,69176,11777,13,24703,7930,11412,757,29557,10367,294,6,31830,4068,46152,864,7521,306,28130,52087,665,1925,13,4366,346,1744,11,97507,11,3625,69176,11777,864,7521,306,28130,52087,665,1925,13,7695,47090,47929,934,35329,29253,6316,34561,94943,409,326,6,20991,2933,2254,11,40321,8047,409,61510,33903,294,6,485,592,7379,11,33013,355,11,6681,2303,729,1880,22013,292,1900,11,1880,9517,359,285,90053,409,22040,1441,1081,11099,11,951,3435,8467,78511,14295,13,3206,719,11,272,17771,409,60946,265,4068,20662,34561,94943,34501,818,11,7930,665,15132,15907,78957,11,26077,645,15132,43153,4398,9465,84440,11,1880,4502,3625,3435,8467,78511,14295,934,85217,2322,73468,665,2035,29557,73468,294,6,833,1435,514,7317,6491,556,7010,653,43453,1156,10610,3370,13,1252,25945,72006,1156,10610,3370,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2028,8111,311,387,264,36815,315,459,21308,15864,477,3137,922,279,3229,596,17850,3495,389,279,13076,18455,315,1219,123708,11,220,2636,1667,1306,279,19814,315,279,3861,22249,13,578,19114,15100,430,1219,123708,374,18222,389,5064,323,5131,30801,555,4907,5788,11,902,374,38626,304,279,6206,315,1403,8147,7931,25,1708,27511,11,264,90441,11,323,3331,21246,11,264,4689,627,198,791,3229,8554,430,279,27129,13176,279,4907,10706,617,6197,311,264,4101,315,5435,11,2737,279,25959,315,4983,9818,11,279,22722,315,73802,11,323,264,6996,315,7032,369,69176,11777,13,578,19114,29633,430,832,1648,311,1464,704,315,420,43510,11008,374,311,21797,1463,1219,123708,596,8752,555,11469,502,26593,627,198,11458,11,279,3229,8554,430,1070,527,3892,32116,311,23075,11,2737,279,20160,315,8987,22538,304,5064,11,264,3831,13076,5044,11,323,7701,28175,69176,4590,7512,13,4314,9547,1304,433,5107,369,1219,123708,311,2349,1202,35782,323,3351,4741,627,198,791,19114,55725,31474,264,29564,7558,5814,311,58681,279,18455,596,27129,323,2565,1154,11,323,1243,21630,279,12032,323,5070,315,1219,123708,1555,19905,449,69176,11777,13,578,5915,374,311,3619,1268,279,4029,5097,15637,315,1202,47176,323,1268,586,10396,649,387,1511,311,16988,279,18455,304,264,502,15398,627,198,28589,11,279,36815,8111,311,21782,459,48539,5382,3495,2447,430,22262,311,10765,279,11774,13176,1219,123708,596,13076,1845
