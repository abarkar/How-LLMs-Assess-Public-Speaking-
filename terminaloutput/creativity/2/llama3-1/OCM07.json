However, the cultivation of wheat can be affected by fungal pathogens that produce toxins, which can contaminate the grain and ultimately end up in our food.\n\nThe traditional method for controlling these pathogens has been to use a cocktail of pesticides, but this approach has its own set of problems, including the potential for environmental contamination and negative impacts on human health.\n\nInstead, the speaker suggests using beneficial fungi that are naturally found in the environment. These \"good\" fungi have been shown to be effective at controlling fungal pathogens and can be used as a sustainable alternative to pesticides.\n\nThe speaker's research focuses on observing the interactions between these beneficial fungi and the fungal pathogens, in order to better understand their strategies and identify which ones are most effective at controlling the pathogens.\n\nThe goal is to find beneficial fungi that can be used to protect wheat crops without harming the environment or human health. By studying the code genetic of these fungi, researchers can gain a better understanding of how they defend themselves against fungal pathogens and develop new methods for using them as a sustainable solution.\n\nOverall, the speaker's presentation suggests that by harnessing the power of beneficial fungi, we can create a more sustainable and environmentally-friendly approach to controlling fungal pathogens in wheat fields.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,16770,11,653,7970,4411,346,2933,409,6784,70412,3930,293,11206,4091,11,653,14425,66262,11,6316,259,20430,10253,30584,9004,11,6033,9189,62299,25692,85815,5636,272,22231,12704,84,11,23317,6033,27812,66,788,13,46706,26725,3625,4865,11,26725,27750,453,12843,1744,326,54386,38831,83384,961,412,7010,29449,38450,367,15132,31605,5512,409,272,68862,3916,1880,7546,54960,409,1529,978,13,2009,10025,593,11,272,17771,1744,37953,409,1208,7829,409,3846,1529,978,11,951,46415,1056,1439,3355,89810,1651,64,16339,3625,50510,285,13,1952,3625,53051,2473,5636,71357,35641,625,2439,32118,99906,13,19421,27750,35641,625,2439,32118,99906,11,46152,2558,285,306,28463,951,41569,1572,409,98385,22337,20243,2482,25945,60014,85,22626,5019,29449,77323,13,763,2749,21041,11,84568,82133,96586,513,2840,74333,7010,3625,41936,409,1529,978,11,44829,7010,1208,3117,483,11,44829,7010,29449,6784,11,1880,36875,13327,1001,2605,78,16339,409,62281,8811,17491,13,1708,1105,11,55398,6,3457,1880,41199,6316,2960,8511,294,6,1036,14014,11,1208,44397,19395,648,5019,326,6339,45973,27750,35641,625,2439,32118,99906,46874,1339,1765,653,41010,7447,12,30223,76195,15890,389,802,3714,1339,3625,71581,8065,35019,339,2727,951,829,19941,13,34447,74699,11,9189,1880,41091,11427,2439,1744,3846,308,17771,6502,1208,51651,6425,13,3341,17317,11427,2439,1744,27750,54021,41569,8467,84440,28463,3355,89810,3869,28130,7364,35522,261,514,1529,978,11,10071,28463,3625,20183,45632,18434,1821,11,326,93847,1880,326,6,266,8801,764,12339,13,24971,1948,11,568,258,11,220,1041,8261,42138,13,7695,4498,1339,39587,10045,261,294,81979,10105,10253,17744,38647,5019,3625,3709,2058,3869,841,5636,75144,27750,54021,11,16968,665,16513,519,409,1760,978,1414,28130,7829,13,19421,272,17771,39015,934,6,40997,665,1156,48099,16968,653,23100,73899,409,35641,625,2439,1744,326,54386,71451,7138,75,1001,7010,326,41901,2842,40280,11,1880,7930,513,15132,1860,14081,5512,2107,4893,294,6,3342,5615,9211,6033,409,9517,1072,556,1208,33824,3930,35641,62799,32118,11943,13,41621,326,6,52659,13550,285,11,951,35641,625,2439,16265,8839,13,19421,27750,35641,625,2439,16265,8839,11,3900,665,29253,665,20272,951,2606,4918,294,6,25632,4558,1634,1765,1208,3197,66522,11,1880,951,2606,4918,7930,15132,35597,59148,29263,46777,9880,13,7695,47090,39587,46524,6316,6425,5019,13110,51794,479,3625,447,2053,409,27750,35641,625,2439,16265,8839,23536,1188,23761,3625,79713,5019,3698,1617,265,3625,35641,625,2439,32118,99906,13,3206,42775,409,270,4558,325,6824,68,39587,3869,22842,951,3698,1900,9465,35641,625,2439,16265,8839,1880,35641,625,2439,32118,99906,13,622,6,434,61055,409,64972,60946,265,3625,44397,19395,552,951,35641,625,2439,16265,8839,1880,294,6,16288,26077,645,6916,288,46152,42587,306,13,19421,26077,645,6916,288,42587,306,5019,48021,38612,28130,29511,12267,41569,2428,13,4366,51173,11,503,6,49133,4502,514,35641,62799,16265,321,1826,13171,294,6,3239,42219,951,22337,20243,2482,7930,82133,14091,3023,265,514,35641,62799,32118,11943,13,328,35329,25692,514,296,4091,2167,1133,11,326,6,3342,5615,9211,409,2558,556,15907,41569,1572,11,25400,4499,261,829,46798,1018,554,5019,1744,25400,841,44829,325,5636,513,52895,716,13,69327,35597,11,16968,3869,1208,37291,13,34447,5019,1744,514,35641,62799,16265,321,7591,566,268,1557,829,44397,19395,648,11,1880,39587,8065,40970,6316,409,15907,6916,288,11,3900,11412,39929,63669,294,6,533,1553,951,26467,2598,24520,31539,409,4538,9827,45,5019,43998,10515,12329,3738,288,22337,20243,2482,294,6,1617,20234,13,61651,97507,11,27584,25400,2278,4558,451,7010,95917,2957,409,15907,2849,2482,11396,2082,78422,99188,11,66090,7930,29557,3869,26725,3625,20183,45632,18434,1821,294,93825,3846,934,85217,15132,13,445,2005,9952,15907,342,1821,409,3830,68,6033,4538,50510,8047,13,19421,9189,9952,26317,20043,2249,296,1138,263,6033,12704,84,13,19421,37953,447,35329,4642,4538,2082,11,503,41901,54387,265,3625,26467,294,6,1846,45,4197,14014,11,3625,1879,12249,11,65735,3625,96642,44397,19395,552,3625,5636,31914,2492,13,19421,272,17771,14707,20662,94721,390,46302,409,40744,27750,44397,19395,552,1880,27750,1879,12249,409,12896,7930,11412,757,29557,10367,409,90194,1370,8318,3625,35641,625,2439,16265,8839,3625,79713,5803,1900,13,3959,35641,625,2439,16265,8839,25945,31914,2492,45973,3625,32118,99906,1880,15878,3369,1441,38605,9533,288,1765,3625,4046,9594,599,66474,951,71581,409,1529,978,13,27058,23761,97717,934,54386,44829,325,26725,35597,1317,67380,296,4091,15878,8137,653,7970,4411,346,2933,409,6784,70412,3930,30870,9363,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5084,1093,499,617,3984,264,36815,315,264,8982,477,15864,389,279,8712,315,1701,24629,81540,311,2585,95447,78284,304,34153,5151,11,439,459,10778,311,61257,627,198,8586,596,264,12399,315,279,1495,512,198,791,19114,8638,555,39686,279,12939,315,16385,323,1023,41778,11822,11,902,527,3629,1903,505,34153,13,4452,11,279,52129,315,34153,649,387,11754,555,95447,78284,430,8356,62186,11,902,649,687,309,3357,
