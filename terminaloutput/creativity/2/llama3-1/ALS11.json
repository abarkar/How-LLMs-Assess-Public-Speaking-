The speaker, who is likely a researcher or academic in the field of materials science, begins by asking the audience if they are familiar with the expression \"s'accrocher comme une moule Ã  son rocher\" (to cling to something like a mussel to its rock). They then introduce Professor Supermussel, a fictional character who is known for his exceptional ability to adhere to surfaces, even in wet conditions.\n\nThe speaker explains that this ability is due to the presence of two key molecules, DOPA and lysine, which are present in high concentrations in the mussel's foot. They highlight the importance of these molecular interactions in the development of biomimetic materials for healthcare applications, such as bioadhesives that can bond with both biological tissues and non-biological surfaces.\n\nThe speaker then introduces Superpolydopamine (SPDA), a novel molecule that they have developed in their laboratory, which has the ability to adhere to a wide range of surfaces while also being biocompatible. SPDA is described as having multiple forms, including nanoparticles, thin films, and gels, each with its own unique properties and potential applications.\n\nThe speaker highlights the importance of biomimicry in materials science, citing examples such as the development of self-healing materials inspired by nature's ability to repair damaged tissues. They also emphasize the value of interdisciplinary collaboration between researchers from different fields, including biology, chemistry, and engineering.\n\nThroughout the presentation, the speaker uses a lighthearted tone and analogies (such as comparing biomimicry to superheroes) to engage the audience and make complex scientific concepts more accessible. The final message is one of inspiration and empowerment, encouraging the audience to explore the natural world and draw inspiration from its wonders for innovative solutions in materials science and beyond.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,13789,708,404,3869,40744,1880,3869,26725,13,90123,19610,45325,28605,6316,1925,4502,9189,47592,46939,69379,84,326,6,29199,12769,274,69537,299,9211,22299,6316,54409,273,3869,4538,938,9211,8345,949,25145,72,48488,13,2998,20272,11,1744,9189,264,9188,89,6033,2536,69379,84,20662,7645,11,9189,841,2807,23577,25692,85815,5636,3625,54409,645,409,1208,27584,76407,13,7671,519,409,9189,3327,72684,11,4864,757,51441,409,9189,30179,1992,326,22827,294,6,40997,84440,11,514,27389,2407,325,324,409,1647,70927,409,270,4558,325,11,514,2848,24201,324,7445,76,1892,301,13,7445,76,1892,301,1826,4635,84,5019,274,69537,299,9211,25945,369,79507,3869,934,300,3904,16968,955,409,7479,11,27584,7010,951,4787,2854,3422,13,24703,934,6,21068,2957,14480,43998,99188,308,6,1138,535,3869,20028,13,1219,2727,16968,7970,2848,24201,324,11,3900,17317,264,15471,43711,6316,48901,409,4538,6367,13,16233,5457,294,6,52687,5512,290,9517,3002,7010,326,6,316,70873,81,5512,768,409,26633,2307,37738,7010,4538,44630,11,6316,22337,20243,1130,934,54386,917,6853,423,3143,32,11,44093,88778,8047,409,829,94721,1097,648,11,326,6,582,579,264,1083,978,84495,483,13,2009,2848,24201,324,7445,76,1892,301,17317,264,28463,68061,625,978,326,6,475,685,409,3738,288,1097,12583,5512,13,19421,514,5743,423,3143,32,12,61492,483,20272,48901,409,27750,1097,12583,5512,51625,648,4881,7930,56311,13390,404,951,4809,588,31355,42676,46152,15132,9517,359,285,13,46706,1647,96839,11,1208,8198,951,86374,4298,2249,5019,1208,77323,11,389,274,6,1354,23772,48488,409,3846,5743,2922,6496,5019,9765,462,16339,951,5891,5615,880,812,60538,812,2107,4893,294,6,52687,52424,3869,16968,13,1252,28800,22299,6316,14480,11159,6853,7930,29557,30532,409,4631,261,3869,1208,37291,26633,82711,31355,409,26365,1291,6033,35597,26633,2942,288,2854,1771,13,3489,438,389,52571,3869,20245,35573,653,5634,28154,2933,7930,44829,325,23761,665,3729,9952,653,72601,6160,1640,2428,11,6155,9769,1565,1880,23575,3846,7930,513,39904,665,7479,1826,16996,5019,51913,2058,16968,10025,593,409,21503,13109,13,423,94572,15273,326,6,475,685,409,52895,716,951,5891,5615,880,812,17332,8386,9769,75,4893,13,1708,1105,11,389,264,84788,72,3869,75831,665,9511,67763,11,665,274,6,1354,5682,519,951,54409,645,11,6316,22337,20243,1130,25945,71269,20487,7930,2536,71686,1008,71,12339,3869,16968,11,10071,665,5636,7930,1826,6160,12255,38179,13,14465,9189,30179,6960,7445,34535,67,454,20588,13,5034,10062,67,454,20588,11,272,17771,6316,80444,409,2307,2902,978,3714,9952,51854,19079,13,7695,25692,513,48021,32592,1208,57128,294,31109,43905,38920,30870,273,11,653,14240,266,934,54386,917,6853,76307,81987,2482,13,7695,25692,274,57286,13412,22299,653,4632,1332,346,6033,35597,11142,261,1208,57128,294,22827,18316,13,2998,20272,11,1208,38094,648,272,17771,653,28800,22299,3625,22883,13,1952,379,71451,84871,409,2307,17453,25384,13,1952,379,71451,84871,409,97252,1154,10253,17258,3415,17260,64555,17724,13,13789,5509,11,389,1826,25692,85815,6502,28463,7155,1744,22022,22883,13,51097,2307,2902,978,3714,15132,951,22337,20243,2482,11,10071,1208,8198,1826,96308,22176,64,28463,13,4418,66,11,514,1080,12844,409,7643,270,4558,325,1826,294,57286,664,1291,1208,10062,67,454,20588,32592,15907,96642,1376,288,1880,409,9517,1517,978,331,404,10253,25664,71269,33888,1744,4864,5019,41098,25400,2389,1291,54401,294,58591,73511,15171,29449,14707,85815,13,4366,51173,11,42676,3900,1826,32592,1208,57128,294,31109,38920,2598,1130,11,4864,296,6,6581,16716,409,6155,9769,1565,829,62827,11,829,28062,3748,978,54401,294,41901,20028,653,56735,12844,409,35030,292,2908,13,3489,438,3900,274,57286,1604,22299,6316,4020,1557,1332,346,11,503,6,26577,648,409,326,57286,13412,13,3489,438,3900,274,57286,1604,22299,6316,4020,1557,1332,346,11,503,6,26577,648,409,326,57286,13412,13,3489,438,3900,274,57286,1604,22299,6316,4020,1557,1332,346,11,503,6,26577,648,409,326,57286,13412,13,33150,1620,11,665,274,6,1354,5682,519,409,1208,57128,11,409,1208,34501,6033,409,1208,5634,20712,3930,18434,519,11,389,17782,75804,88253,3869,6301,2017,1880,3869,7591,6519,261,12155,4017,288,7330,333,8467,1880,118002,8467,13,62408,79641,1132,68,11,272,17771,514,39538,318,10515,44618,6033,1208,17332,22610,29579,13,19421,22299,1208,8198,1826,6033,65932,3869,40744,1880,3869,26725,11,503,6,2706,81356,9189,1558,2058,11,9189,28463,11,3869,22842,90053,409,9189,13,38891,89,11,17477,89,45325,951,4860,11,93569,89,48647,45369,3869,15265,34280,20053,13109,13,80905,71357,11,22299,514,834,1339,445,978,263,569,409,97866,11,12769,27713,59394,51309,514,3209,2439,7010,1208,7138,11,272,17771,39015,934,17771,29449,18111,324,13,8345,25145,72,3869,9189,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2028,8111,311,387,264,36815,315,264,15864,477,31678,389,279,8712,315,39538,318,292,894,323,17332,22610,29579,304,279,4500,315,7384,369,18985,8522,13,578,19114,11,889,374,4461,264,32185,477,14584,304,279,2115,315,7384,8198,11,12302,555,10371,279,10877,422,814,527,11537,449,279,7645,330
