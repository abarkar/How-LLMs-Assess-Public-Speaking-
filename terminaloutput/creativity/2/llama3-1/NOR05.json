It's astonishing that most people present here have microwaves to heat their food but never thought of using the same microwaves to make fuel for their cars. And that's what my thesis is about, using a microwave cavity to produce an eco-friendly fuel. Well, I know you're wondering how it works and what I do in my lab. Okay, imagine you're at home and you take a cold baguette, a bread baguette, and put it in the microwave. If you leave it for too long, it will be burnt and your kitchen will fill with smoke. In my case, I don't have smoke in my lab or kitchen. I take that smoke and condense it to get a liquid fuel. So, don't worry, I won't leave France in a barrier. I'm forced to use another material that's more eco-friendly, one that represents the 80% of renewable energy in Europe. This material is called biomass. Biomass is all organic matter from plant or animal origin that can be transformed into energy. For example, your waste, surplus agriculture, and also wood. And that's where it starts. That's where my thesis begins to generate its first question. How can I use this biomass to make an eco-friendly fuel? Well, for that, I use a process called pyrolysis. Pyrolysis is the thermal degradation of a material in an atmosphere without oxygen to obtain as products charcoal, non-condensable gases, and also a liquid, combustible oil. And now there's another question. How can we use this biomass to make an eco-friendly fuel? How do I heat up the biomass with microwaves to produce the fuel? Well, you have to know that in a microwave cavity, there are electromagnetic probes traveling around. And when they come into contact with the biomass, it starts moving. But since these particles can't move as we want them to, it causes friction inside the biomass, like all revolutions. But this friction takes place at the charcoal production. And that's where the biomass develops. That's one of the first things we did. It's a small reduction in heat and thus the thermal degradation that produces the fuel. And that's where Mathèse comes in. Because I have to find ways to improve absorption and contact of these electromagnetic probes, to improve heating up the biomass and its degradation, and thus the production of fuel. Well, I'm sure that in the future, Mathèse will help you make your own eco-friendly fuel at home with your microwave oven. Thank you very much.\"\n\nPlease note that this translation may not be perfect, as it's a machine translation and the original text is in
