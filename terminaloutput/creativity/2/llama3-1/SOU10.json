So, you have to imagine a cockpit with screens that make you believe you're on the runway, ready to take off. But, if you only learn from this visual information and try to fly a plane in real conditions, you'll quickly realize there's still much to learn. It's because you lack essential vestibular information during your training. Vestibular information comes from an organ located inside your inner ear, which gives you all the information about your body position in space. That's why flight simulators can move in every direction to recreate real conditions. Your brain needs a maximum of information to learn, and these come from different sensory organs in your body. Here, it's the eyes and vestibular system. The question I ask myself is: how does the brain process this information? Scientists have already asked themselves this question, but they only looked at a few neurons. But multi-sensory processes involve different regions of the brain, and therefore thousands of neurons. It's like trying to study Paris traffic by looking at just one car. But if you can follow all the cars at once, you'll quickly get the overall network, its dynamics, and interactions between all these cars. And that's exactly what I want to do. Measure the activity of each neuron in the brain simultaneously. And the only vertebrate that will be most important is the brain. The traffic that allows me to experience this today is the zebrafish larva. Because it's completely transparent and its brain measures less than a millimeter. It's perfect for placing under a microscope and looking at its brain all at once.\n\nThe first step of my thesis was to build a flight simulator for a zebrafish larva. The idea is exactly the same, except that the larvae are placed in a small aquarium and fixed with agarose gel, like a pilot attached to his seat. I also added a screen around the larva to simulate a visual environment.\n\nThe second step of my thesis was to add an option. I miniaturized an embedded microscope that allows me to photograph different layers of the brain. Thus, I get a 3D image of the brain with a 4th dimension, time, which gives me access to the dynamics of neurons. Thanks to this experience, I was able to measure the neural dynamics for the first time when the larva is moved left or right. My goal is to complete this map with the neural dynamics when there is a visual environment around the larvae. This will allow me to find out which neurons are active in both cases and understand how this brain composed of about 100,000 neurons processes sensory
