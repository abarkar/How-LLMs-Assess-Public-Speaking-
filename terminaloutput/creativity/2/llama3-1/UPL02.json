The writer shares a personal experience where their niece Jeanne asked them a question that left them wondering: \"Where were you before you were born?\" The writer didn't know how to respond, but as they grew older, they discovered the practice of philosophical conversations with children.\n\nThe writer notes that this approach is not new and has been around since the 1970s. They highlight the importance of considering children as capable of thinking for themselves, just like adults do. This perspective aligns with the United Nations' Convention on the Rights of the Child (1989), which recognizes children as having their own rights.\n\nThe writer also mentions that they are studying education and human rights law, specifically the global program for education about human rights launched by the UN in 2004. They wonder if philosophical conversations with children could be a way to help them better understand their rights. To test this idea, the writer has been trained to lead such conversations and wants to develop a pedagogical protocol that transforms certain articles of the Convention into philosophical discussions for children.\n\nHowever, the writer acknowledges that there are concerns about the universality of human rights and whether they are too Western-centric. They propose that by using a more horizontal pedagogy like philosophical conversations with children, it may be possible to address these concerns and ensure cultural pluralism in education about human rights.\n\nOverall, the text seems to be exploring the potential of philosophical conversations with children as a way to promote education and understanding of human rights, while also addressing concerns around universality and cultural diversity.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,88245,11,503,31769,2629,285,39723,33670,409,4415,66014,949,64105,64,11,272,17771,1208,3488,1744,7643,13080,4558,346,20263,818,296,26248,1153,8047,3869,220,20,8261,13,1708,1105,3154,519,9189,13510,1744,4864,841,11427,2852,6502,21965,75249,75871,265,13,29124,66,2182,20263,818,11,9964,72567,300,39043,42676,9964,1446,300,5636,25626,11,294,69537,541,949,74656,97717,11,27549,43989,7591,3209,361,409,7643,90509,13,14465,1208,60946,82,13,11842,10071,272,17771,83195,11,272,17771,57625,39043,13,350,788,27750,60404,7930,17317,1153,306,951,4860,3073,306,13327,645,11,1880,17317,7930,74533,39015,3869,293,19395,1155,11,4864,36731,78705,265,1744,39043,9189,1826,46939,69003,978,13,2998,16968,4865,11,41091,39043,296,26248,10805,27843,8047,13,19421,272,17771,22299,39043,1744,503,34155,59148,1653,1208,95234,409,1208,13868,648,9952,3625,60404,13,452,8047,32592,326,6,8039,580,3930,10891,437,81509,4242,26235,445,2877,18022,7010,3625,65838,220,2031,13,39783,95234,7930,274,17771,68866,8047,409,961,412,7010,514,38900,13,19421,4864,757,36731,22011,11,55475,9952,3625,60404,11,272,17771,3625,77554,52424,2536,6502,71686,22299,951,86696,20183,45632,3869,1760,978,1414,11,10071,22299,409,45165,1018,4893,924,75004,7930,56311,23423,261,1370,84440,1474,5615,9004,13,2582,11,389,38831,83384,20662,43656,7010,1208,26958,2655,38135,951,97222,409,326,41901,61827,409,220,3753,24,11,7930,77554,12339,326,41901,61827,22299,653,45165,23349,70927,409,64079,13,19421,326,6,12210,13109,11,19189,65699,62891,11,841,17317,282,2473,6502,13510,514,32150,556,13,1708,1105,11,16968,39043,11,41091,39043,296,55624,978,22550,66021,1744,503,57286,664,648,514,64079,3869,326,31769,34985,11,1880,5636,51625,285,42625,326,31769,34985,10253,97222,2854,1771,13,1708,1105,11,3625,19687,1252,552,14848,5906,665,2035,41199,220,1049,19,11,653,18629,62940,532,294,31769,34985,10253,97222,409,326,6,87713,11,15890,1208,55133,10474,60172,1765,326,6,1137,625,1133,36413,556,1880,2132,12267,13,34447,45575,11,4068,48021,665,99225,61480,653,19227,18629,949,7695,47090,100243,479,9517,1517,978,331,404,10253,13531,35933,281,15433,55180,8467,13,9589,54312,1744,9189,3567,39395,39723,4864,5320,2249,665,96586,949,9589,54312,1744,1208,95234,409,1208,13868,648,9952,3625,60404,841,92215,6502,23761,653,23464,1291,5019,6316,94721,86740,409,43153,97222,949,1708,1105,11,4864,841,63762,6502,13,1708,1105,11,5019,38211,20662,45455,4558,325,11,4864,91507,1765,514,25911,13,1219,2727,514,46110,1732,68155,11,39015,11,4864,757,36731,1376,8047,3869,459,3212,951,520,301,4918,409,13868,648,9952,3625,60404,11,5019,20028,665,80444,1744,3625,60404,841,834,306,6502,3846,934,85217,23423,306,11,10071,934,85217,23423,306,3846,934,85217,834,306,11,3625,1097,804,3869,6316,3738,68,74772,768,13868,2428,13,3206,1665,333,11,272,17771,409,75831,653,1760,511,1286,281,15433,55180,2428,7930,43678,1339,76076,9908,409,1208,26958,2655,38135,951,97222,409,326,41901,61827,665,409,45165,1018,4893,520,301,4918,409,13868,648,11,5019,76826,11083,7889,6033,2536,1208,18713,258,768,294,22827,19227,1760,511,1286,13,34447,3900,379,264,653,10071,13,3489,17771,54312,1744,39043,1879,57609,11,6316,4046,34985,11159,6853,10253,97222,409,326,6,87713,949,14465,841,36731,6502,15878,47929,934,35329,29253,6316,65058,43665,3930,57705,12339,3056,1748,12812,21911,43711,409,1208,8246,27584,409,27750,97222,13,19421,20662,43665,841,296,48099,6502,1744,951,38682,1769,42284,83391,13,1708,1105,11,4068,326,31769,34985,10253,97222,2854,1771,25692,12,6853,75871,265,3869,27750,665,3841,2249,11,40192,404,514,39598,44618,7829,75,949,14465,66517,326,39982,1100,8942,4558,325,1744,1370,1208,95234,409,1208,13868,648,9952,3625,60404,11,7930,1826,6316,281,15433,55180,648,5636,4917,6317,1604,11,7930,2322,326,41901,61827,8065,272,89412,409,15907,9517,12287,919,1765,3625,97222,11,45575,389,25692,40192,404,326,6,6802,1728,409,1208,13868,648,9952,3625,60404,11,389,25692,40192,404,326,6,2295,66,44547,13109,8065,19910,409,1208,9517,12287,290,11,16968,665,9071,519,409,9517,1517,978,331,404,3869,653,11159,301,3284,1880,19477,3159,13,1708,1105,20263,818,11,4864,36731,46838,337,8047,11,4864,308,34155,6502,924,12646,2159,404,3869,9637,3488,11,10071,9964,100164,11,74699,4864,91507,68226,514,20028,5019,26725,3625,46106,60404,11,3869,1081,20099,1370,91254,11,4538,46110,1448,12339,11,7930,25400,11,264,293,1188,35657,220,20,8261,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5084,1093,499,617,3984,279,36815,315,264,1495,5439,555,4423,889,374,8173,304,19675,323,6873,13,578,7061,13551,264,4443,3217,1405,872,80115,20263,818,4691,1124,264,3488,430,2163,1124,20910,25,330,9241,1051,499,1603,499,1051,9405,7673,578,7061,3287,956,1440,1268,311,6013,11,719,439,814,14264,9191,11,814,11352,279,6725,315,41903,21633,449,2911,627,198,791,7061,8554,430,420,5603,374,539,502,323,706,1027,2212,2533,279,220,777,2031,82,13,2435,11415,279,12939,315,13126,2911,439,13171,315,7422,369,5694,11,1120,1093,12884,656
