Here's a breakdown of what I've combined:\n\n**Title:** (None)\n\n**Text:** The speaker shares their passion for mechanics, inspired by their father's work. They discuss the increasing automation of vehicles and the potential for fully autonomous driving. However, this raises concerns about cybersecurity threats to connected objects like cars.\n\nThe speaker then explains their thesis: how to teach a car to learn and defend itself against attacks. This involves creating an artificial intelligence that simulates the immune system of an autonomous vehicle. The AI would detect new attacks and viruses, just like our immune systems do, to protect the vehicle from malicious intrusions.\n\nThe speaker highlights two types of immune responses: innate (rapid but limited) and acquired/adaptive (learned and effective against new threats). Their AI system is designed to learn and adapt, similar to an adaptive immune response. This allows it to detect and respond to novel attacks and viruses.\n\nThe text concludes by emphasizing the importance of protecting vehicles from cyber threats and ensuring their safety. The speaker notes that technology has always brought comfort and security to humanity, and they hope that their AI system will help protect people from human error in autonomous driving.\n\n**Themes:** \n\n1. Cybersecurity and the risks associated with connected objects\n2. Artificial intelligence and its potential applications in cybersecurity\n3. The importance of protecting vehicles from malicious intrusions\n\n**Tone:** Informative, enthusiastic, and cautionary","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,3206,281,12339,1826,32118,4919,3457,268,13,356,8458,296,26248,44093,15550,258,978,409,514,46131,665,26633,6033,56321,1437,4042,645,1323,7211,265,665,15572,68,3625,45165,83613,2482,13,362,9832,77492,88253,11,6316,48901,409,4538,47929,1826,5113,3689,8047,13,11876,4160,42204,274,49455,31559,8372,5118,306,13,1952,274,6,391,652,37093,27584,3869,3625,98054,4684,4558,79507,95103,288,13,69327,1208,86806,7754,1744,17317,44521,2439,3869,28130,71751,11,272,17771,29449,9284,13,7695,513,25692,934,54386,45441,1208,88818,46680,2214,39723,326,54386,274,1815,76069,556,13,2998,5589,11,5019,76076,11,3625,36852,4918,3869,2278,978,1126,653,14175,285,13,7695,47090,47929,934,31109,81645,11,272,17771,653,31260,4667,978,11,22299,29449,100007,13,4418,66,11,3900,25692,23761,272,1260,294,6,1617,20234,6033,409,17188,13,19421,4502,11,7010,29449,2317,68,409,9693,1941,978,2407,13109,75804,88253,11,3625,2909,1441,4667,5512,11,389,3625,60172,1765,17317,11,2486,467,11,272,17771,17317,7930,682,2439,23761,2700,5512,1370,27750,2909,1441,13,19421,3625,1651,64,14295,56311,17317,11148,556,1880,11148,556,3869,29449,1218,61140,13,14465,9189,436,395,554,11,272,17771,39015,39723,86953,1188,7643,270,4558,325,13,12535,20028,917,9484,265,3869,6316,81645,949,12535,274,6,3989,1773,121597,408,265,949,39783,81645,2278,4558,451,51854,2909,1441,13,31137,3357,324,11,4046,70329,2428,1880,28463,951,2107,668,1759,7930,82133,25400,29557,10367,409,9302,12329,11,8678,805,1880,59394,951,35881,6948,13,6178,72,11,1647,42775,6824,68,3869,48021,665,2035,951,12384,288,1880,951,1491,85798,7033,978,8637,8467,5019,19477,52750,6316,11478,1989,1104,72,6853,7930,11412,1675,8646,514,72601,4998,3928,12267,294,31109,81645,3154,263,638,13,1219,2727,29449,72601,4998,3928,12267,11,4538,436,57332,1826,409,20028,665,80444,1744,12155,2909,1441,841,513,7591,583,75,306,6502,13,19421,409,47371,408,265,4538,2942,44618,45973,43905,76220,294,52152,376,7713,8811,588,484,5048,13,46706,3625,42345,66474,4998,3928,17724,11,389,264,26633,4595,13,39783,294,635,6301,8047,11,7930,9517,74972,100198,11,10071,58271,409,20028,3663,3869,951,945,22550,1759,87325,13,19421,6316,294,635,19830,1082,6033,10737,1413,11,1841,27549,1826,13171,294,53149,9484,265,3869,74282,66014,64972,4538,61624,22530,13,6178,72,11,1647,11478,1989,1104,72,6853,11,27549,274,6,1354,23772,3930,26633,90272,955,13,3341,1647,528,14081,49530,1826,409,85877,440,261,409,80080,1651,64,14295,1880,409,87325,17188,13,27058,20028,3663,3869,326,6,613,1923,1133,409,12155,2909,1441,13,19421,409,47371,408,265,4538,2942,44618,45973,43905,76220,294,52152,376,7713,8811,588,484,5048,13,19421,409,47371,408,265,4538,2942,44618,45973,43905,76220,294,52152,376,7713,8811,588,484,5048,13,19421,409,47371,408,265,4538,2942,44618,45973,43905,76220,294,52152,376,7713,8811,588,484,5048,13,362,326,6,613,1923,1133,1880,3869,1208,34280,20053,13109,951,41467,13,19421,5019,3846,20028,11,326,55624,8677,1989,1104,72,6853,11,7930,1826,9517,22235,1370,11083,12384,288,11,15765,4618,40744,3625,17320,9465,3625,85114,40321,1821,409,1208,81645,13,27058,4043,1155,294,53149,9484,265,6316,12223,11,653,12541,294,6,37939,46429,11,7930,3608,57609,514,52962,1133,4725,3930,45165,83613,1130,13,19421,4502,3869,653,4545,11,326,57286,266,3930,72601,409,1208,81645,1826,98642,3869,1208,12223,11,39587,43905,35881,1854,7930,11412,23761,85424,1826,63828,13178,547,13,19421,7010,514,4865,32150,556,11,4502,326,57286,266,7591,64519,11,409,1208,12223,11,3900,379,40142,6316,70673,648,13,19421,39015,11,326,55624,8677,1989,1104,72,6853,11412,7591,566,268,9211,951,42345,66474,409,77463,13,27058,8654,5615,9211,43905,76220,294,52152,376,7713,13,5034,2869,38469,264,44093,1469,403,978,67009,1880,77463,3869,326,93825,2854,467,13,435,2852,519,665,80444,1744,326,55624,8677,1989,1104,72,6853,17317,1760,73899,409,1208,293,49530,1082,2854,8511,13,19421,4502,653,9880,11,1647,281,12339,1826,7010,6316,81645,3154,263,638,11,1880,829,2107,1295,11,3900,308,6,4202,1339,6502,3869,6033,63346,514,2107,354,13,25145,72,13,25145,72,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,32,27387,1495,0,5810,596,264,31085,315,1148,358,3077,11093,1473,9,9,3936,68063,320,4155,696,9,9,1199,68063,578,19114,13551,872,11939,369,30126,11,14948,555,872,7126,596,990,13,2435,4358,279,7859,33762,315,11731,323,279,4754,369,7373,39293,10043,13,4452,11,420,25930,10742,922,62542,18208,311,8599,6302,1093,9515,627,198,791,19114,1243,15100,872,17850,25,1268,311,4639,264,1841,311,4048,323,10726,5196,2403,8951,13,1115,18065,6968,459,21075,11478,430,1675,24031,279,22852,1887,315,459,39293,7458,13,578,15592,1053,11388,502,8951,323,42068,11,1120,1093,1057,22852,6067,656,11,311,6144,279,7458,505,39270,10805,36807,627,198,791,19114,22020,1403,4595,315,22852,14847,25,65070,320,86812,719,7347,8,323,19426,14,42662,320,12964,291,323,7524,2403,502,18208,570,11205,15592,1887,374,6319,311,4048,323,10737,11,4528,311,459,48232,22852,2077,13,1115,6276,433,311,11388,323
