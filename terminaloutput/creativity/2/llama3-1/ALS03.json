The geographer uses the concept of metabolism to explain how animals (like Chiara) process food and energy, and then extends this idea to cities and territories, showing how they too have a \"metabolism\" that involves consuming resources, transforming them, and releasing waste.\n\nThe conversation highlights the parallels between an animal's metabolism and a city's metabolism. The geographer explains that, just as Chiara needs a certain amount of food to stay healthy, cities need a certain amount of resources (like energy, water, and materials) to function properly. They also note that, just as Chiara produces waste (in the form of poop), cities produce waste (in the form of pollution, noise, etc.) that can have negative impacts on the environment.\n\nThe geographer then goes on to explain how they use computer programming and data analysis to understand the metabolism of territories, including cities like Alsace. They describe their work as developing resources and methods for studying the metabolism of territories, which involves collecting and processing large amounts of data.\n\nThroughout the conversation, the geographer emphasizes the importance of understanding the metabolism of territories in order to create a more sustainable future. They suggest that, just as we need to provide Chiara with the right diet to stay healthy, we need to find ways to reduce waste and consumption in our cities and territories in order to ensure their long-term viability.\n\nOverall, this text is a great example of how interdisciplinary thinking can be used to address complex problems like sustainability. By drawing on concepts from biology (metabolism) and geography (territory), the geographer is able to develop new insights and tools for understanding and improving the functioning of cities and territories.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,622,34155,653,10065,409,83491,648,11,6316,38920,54951,7930,274,53149,6853,34382,5169,13,34382,5169,11,4864,25400,21559,26725,3625,49301,50026,220,1135,69225,288,409,14425,24181,2392,13,39783,37291,6892,14081,14014,11,27750,14425,24181,2392,82133,513,43678,7010,4538,2942,44618,1880,3127,52424,3625,10184,6417,812,1880,326,31769,64374,934,6,37907,687,72,89810,5019,25400,29557,10367,409,2800,261,8065,1948,409,829,57128,13,362,1208,1913,3930,1920,355,11,3900,66167,45889,7591,331,1441,1744,34382,5169,51913,582,361,32592,57128,409,98385,272,4744,2392,13,5034,10484,13109,294,83508,12843,6892,14081,5512,11,1208,76407,15890,46152,513,1380,2000,479,7010,326,6,8629,44618,1880,3846,7930,665,594,7003,11,16968,39043,11,272,17771,3846,934,54386,917,6853,514,32118,6323,337,44618,294,22827,2942,44618,13,34447,41091,11,4864,841,36731,6502,88704,68,11,4864,308,57286,664,648,6502,3625,47120,288,18434,1821,13,14465,36731,74672,540,4714,383,1880,503,57286,664,648,951,7317,6491,3946,11,951,26886,645,11,951,38682,919,11,951,21935,13,19421,27584,4502,27750,7317,6491,3946,308,6,546,6502,6800,14896,3869,46131,9952,34382,5169,11,46152,14848,11,84440,28463,11,653,32118,6323,337,44618,13,38891,89,6316,39973,22299,653,25500,10065,7010,514,43014,17317,1446,919,26725,665,79071,80444,951,13509,2482,13,19421,14707,11,5019,1744,3846,25500,10065,12,8078,6669,68976,11,44829,325,34501,1215,11,272,17771,12,6496,1773,556,5019,1744,326,31769,45317,648,7364,818,11,17317,3567,2439,29905,12329,951,594,40751,11,951,453,12843,11,3930,66304,11,3930,281,10515,5898,11,951,32118,2629,2249,11,5099,13,48109,841,60534,2439,4046,1325,336,479,6502,60019,40744,27750,594,40751,11,10071,17317,3625,1615,316,24483,11,3625,5276,2439,1880,3625,312,15769,2439,11,16968,22299,34382,5169,1615,316,2727,11,5276,68,1880,78467,6672,15907,14425,24181,2392,13,12095,4864,5320,2249,47929,3846,1744,34382,5169,1615,316,2727,11,3846,308,17771,6502,25945,77411,13,7695,8657,275,409,18541,261,15907,14425,24181,2392,33670,409,3625,25400,71751,1880,294,6,25632,52424,934,6,37907,841,893,17187,6502,13,7695,8657,275,409,18541,261,15907,14425,24181,2392,33670,409,3625,25400,71751,1880,294,6,25632,52424,934,6,37907,841,893,17187,6502,13,7695,8657,275,409,18541,261,15907,14425,24181,2392,33670,409,3625,25400,71751,1880,294,6,25632,52424,934,6,37907,841,893,17187,6502,13,34447,5019,47929,3846,1744,1615,316,2727,6033,78467,6672,653,7317,6491,556,11,1208,259,9011,1557,1826,47838,479,5636,6485,68,13,19421,3900,379,264,48488,11,48488,409,46681,3869,51010,36501,13,5034,5788,40574,292,1286,11,326,58736,27523,13726,12339,11,3625,312,75004,5553,326,6,1334,11,5553,326,93847,11,1208,57459,665,7591,14215,11,514,7710,409,15572,438,5014,1880,14707,294,81979,13,33150,2860,11,40744,5634,59307,2389,263,1072,288,11,3846,15132,51854,43386,33903,409,11990,409,52021,7930,4319,29580,46777,76132,1765,653,7317,6491,556,22299,326,6,77968,580,13,362,32384,11,1647,42775,1826,409,52895,716,951,594,40751,11,951,594,40751,7930,15132,70720,11,1880,294,49963,12329,3625,75601,2601,7930,17634,306,5636,4382,1880,5636,51794,326,57286,799,3930,32118,6323,337,44618,409,12155,7317,6491,3946,665,29557,61512,409,51010,36501,1880,294,6,69331,2058,40744,27750,46681,13,27058,45602,11,1647,6141,3357,324,1826,653,4958,84048,25945,8791,458,13,5186,12416,39929,3608,90859,514,955,294,6,26125,934,35329,47090,14951,8646,1880,52895,716,653,18629,7591,8747,978,11,4864,36731,46838,494,2852,13171,409,342,52424,409,38546,10484,35933,294,6,41540,811,13,356,8458,757,29557,409,75871,265,5636,51794,479,3869,96642,4860,3869,31632,409,46681,1437,2142,13,42215,1615,316,2727,6033,78467,6672,75249,949,507,15273,949,3489,438,949,19421,665,74940,10484,13109,949,14465,1446,2852,653,1891,10515,10515,3457,268,7930,76605,48021,34382,5169,8065,38682,547,11,4864,757,1153,81356,3625,123299,9004,4860,13,34447,3846,308,17771,6502,34382,5169,934,35329,47090,48021,8065,38682,547,13,24703,15132,14707,12155,7317,6491,3946,7930,1615,316,479,21965,409,594,40751,11,665,16968,4865,5636,1744,3846,1744,1208,3197,66522,841,25692,5790,283,899,261,13,362,32384,11,9952,1647,42775,11,503,6,25632,12339,75831,3625,704,8839,7930,29557,376,546,3869,653,43453,36252,1291,294,58736,1601,13,39783,80444,409,1891,10515,10515,3457,268,3930,7317,6491,556,7930,46524,64,514,38682,547,10737,978,5019,1744,29449,82653,648,44829,325,2018,8977,3869,34501,1215,27220,479,13,14465,36731,46838,494,2852,13171,409,342,52424,409,38546,10484,35933,294,6,41540,811,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,27387,1495,0,1102,596,264,36815,315,264,10652,1990,264,3980,42606,323,872,8415,11,34382,5169,13,578,3980,42606,5829,279,7434,315,39097,311,10552,1268,10099,320,4908,34382,5169,8,1920,3691,323,4907,11,323,1243,2289,420,4623,311,9919,323,39543,11,9204,1268,814,2288,617,264,330,4150,53904,2191,1,430,18065,35208,5070,11,46890,1124,11,323,28965,12571,627,198,791,10652,22020,279,72474,1990,459,1006
