I'll try to translate it for you:\n\n\"I love waste products. You might find that strange at the same time. Given the enormous amount of waste we accumulate on this planet, it's better to love them than hate them. So if we take care of our waste... To produce paper, we use wood. It's well known that cellulose is extracted from wood, but we also generate 100 million tons of lignin per year, which is the second most abundant component of wood. We don't know what to do with it, so we burn it to produce energy, unfortunately. Well, I ardently wish to save lignin from the flames. I'm trying my best to valorize this waste product. In the laboratory where I work, I've already started giving lignin a new beauty treatment. I'm adding proteins to reactivate its oxygen atoms. It's gaining weight and taking on forms again. Yes, its molecular mass is increasing. But it still has a psychological wound from being forcibly separated from cellulose. To support it, I'm presenting another mystery waste product - corn stover, the handsome devil from around here. If you see this plant lying in the Lima plain for their meeting, I'll reduce Mr. Corn to powder. If that happens with plants, believe me, waste products will continue to accumulate. Our two protagonists are so professional that they eventually give birth to a new composite material - a kind of biodegradable, lightweight plastic reinforced material. With a precision micrometer scanner, I'm observing it in detail, analyzing its mechanical resistance. Maybe tomorrow, we'll be able to find this material in our kitchen furniture, car interiors, phone casings, and so on, thanks to my work and valorizing waste products like lignin. Yes, there's also a touch of romanticism. We can make the world move forward. And so, yes, they're so professional that they give birth to a new composite material with a precision micrometer scanner. I'm observing the vibrations of their chemical bond. Repeat the story... and that's it.\"\n\nPlease note that some parts might be difficult to translate accurately due to the text being a mix of French and English, as well as the creative language used
