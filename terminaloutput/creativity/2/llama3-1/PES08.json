The appearance of an intense cosmic mane illuminating and traversing the spatial void. While some appreciate the beauty of the spectacle, others foresee very bad omens, such as the arrival of bloody wars or the death of illustrious individuals. Comets enter the scene. Ladies and gentlemen, today I have the honor and privilege of introducing you to 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko. But let's be honest, we can simply call it 67P or even Chouri for those close to us. Unfortunately, Mrs. was unable to be present today. That's why I'll try to faithfully recreate what she told me. Please note that Mrs. is not very comfortable with journalists.\n\nAfter ten years of travel, our faithful probe Rosetta, our special envoy, has successfully obtained an audience. As you can see, Her Majesty has accepted to reveal the contents of her heart. A mixture of ice and dust. The gossipmongers will say that 67P is nothing more than a big ball of dirty snow. But I think differently; she is respectable. Not only does she orbit the sun, but she also dares to approach it from time to time, sometimes getting a bit too close. And believe me, no one has ever had the impression of being a man. No one remains frozen in the face of the sun's radiation. In fact, near the divine presence, Mrs. got excited and blew away tons of dust around her.\n\nOur faithful probe Rosetta took advantage of this to collect and analyze these grains of dust left behind. The problem is that the interpretation of the analyses is not straightforward, as they come from an instrument developed twenty years ago. Happily, I have a copy of this instrument at my disposal on Earth, which I can use to analyze materials similar to those found in comets. And compare the results of the analyzes with those from comet dust. Thus, comparing data allows me to unravel the secrets best kept by Her Majesty. The most important information is that Our Majesty contains organic matter. Organic matter based on carbon essential for the proliferation of life.\n\nWe know that comets bombarded primitive Earth, delivering their organic matter and playing a crucial role in the emergence of life. While early comet observers considered these stars as messengers of death, 67P assured me that her ancestors were necessary contributors to life, without which neither you nor I would be present today.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,56744,72,3625,1343,98078,4558,4978,4046,376,5637,7930,459,3904,514,38900,64934,273,5455,11,503,41901,4635,2852,653,7930,75467,54008,67882,3625,5636,66079,9466,36306,13,445,53149,277,684,294,31109,19428,3091,899,554,56754,2428,44087,519,1880,30517,519,514,23895,29079,13,1708,1105,1744,76076,917,43711,12575,1208,5017,978,3930,57891,11,294,81979,9465,3415,1188,49733,409,25945,60014,100063,30179,1154,11,22299,326,6,1138,344,8047,409,1709,261,417,29340,75,15844,6033,1208,10237,294,6,484,592,417,97252,1154,13,11876,470,4558,2392,1218,8135,665,1156,48099,13,36684,67,986,1880,9622,46138,11,75804,88253,11,503,34155,326,39982,30052,324,1880,514,6223,321,73899,409,9189,30179,1992,220,3080,47,921,2303,283,31061,480,9431,27236,9509,13,34447,9465,17317,11,389,25692,326,53149,8023,220,3080,47,6033,27584,921,22185,5019,3625,528,1769,13,8560,75876,43765,11,84276,308,26248,6502,18757,23761,30179,6960,75804,88253,13,356,17771,87320,4864,91507,259,1992,409,2800,275,8977,514,5636,33204,4558,1001,3284,3846,934,80720,296,26248,15473,778,978,13,14465,27389,69,12339,9189,27389,43406,11,84276,308,17771,6502,25945,3869,326,6,4105,9952,3625,23672,288,13,5186,12416,294,953,8261,409,45640,11,29449,33204,51453,4538,451,16870,27625,11,29449,60630,8047,71269,20487,11,264,84788,72,3869,64290,404,6316,10877,13,1219,2727,9189,45366,514,46131,11,16233,31779,478,978,264,4287,978,409,17317,9517,52274,1565,514,76354,409,4538,272,89412,13,1252,296,19010,853,409,2840,580,1880,409,17258,784,20712,13,11876,60014,85,22626,8859,1157,5534,546,1744,220,3080,47,308,17771,934,31109,45371,30870,273,409,841,7404,6412,13,6178,72,11,4864,73953,8065,32150,556,934,80720,1826,62486,13,3341,665,5636,409,7364,1215,90053,3930,13612,321,11,27549,297,325,274,41901,3057,9211,1370,86633,294,22827,28800,21965,84364,13,19421,272,3433,10333,1474,6870,11,54613,308,26248,326,98279,4099,294,93825,653,40351,13,7508,818,841,66167,409,2840,580,3663,8065,18803,91080,3930,8574,84,6354,1286,321,13,2998,67781,11,3869,22267,99481,409,1208,3512,2381,978,11,84276,274,17771,4046,6583,1386,8047,1880,264,5945,544,69328,348,822,3516,479,951,52021,409,17258,784,20712,90053,294,80720,13,44564,33204,51453,4538,451,16870,27625,665,264,11626,978,5019,6667,261,1880,8678,805,27750,41936,409,17258,784,20712,1208,1056,5512,3869,326,6,370,11283,13,2009,80259,11,272,17771,1744,326,6,2295,652,10515,367,951,29060,308,17771,6502,4046,1325,6960,11,1841,84568,2605,72,89810,294,22827,14473,68866,978,3900,379,264,6316,348,76019,8511,294,6,1036,14014,13,1283,554,43765,13,622,34155,3869,7643,46096,1765,10335,265,6316,6293,648,98642,409,42067,14473,13,14465,94297,45575,326,49963,12329,5019,8678,805,951,86374,4298,2249,80664,4893,3869,66056,951,470,4558,2392,13,19421,93455,3625,100246,951,29060,9952,66056,951,17258,46756,31539,470,10515,17724,13,362,32384,11,1208,7809,57288,409,46681,757,29557,294,6,19010,1791,1814,3625,24511,3625,64972,22641,5512,409,16233,31779,478,978,13,445,6,26125,1208,5636,36897,11,272,17771,1744,44564,65473,2392,325,1421,51453,409,1208,5634,20712,2942,2428,13,39783,5634,20712,3869,2385,409,1841,20337,4043,23202,6853,3869,1208,29520,333,53301,409,1208,17536,13,2582,11,17317,11427,2439,1744,3625,470,4558,2392,14848,86562,978,1208,10335,265,28694,11,7591,34667,35534,28130,5634,20712,2942,2428,11,1880,28068,519,44351,653,436,57332,64284,7010,326,31769,1195,29355,3930,18434,519,13,1708,1105,1744,3625,6954,4918,9466,36306,951,470,4558,2392,77554,76743,1188,27750,12025,417,22299,3625,9622,11467,409,1208,10237,11,16233,31779,478,978,220,3080,47,296,26248,1089,324,978,8065,32150,556,1744,15907,46845,5615,45632,14848,24560,951,17210,1759,63846,17724,3869,1208,17536,11,15878,3625,447,2053,13080,9189,11,13080,41091,11,841,1446,919,30179,812,13,362,9832,77492,88253,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,8586,374,279,6498,14807,315,279,1495,512,198,34710,279,15234,44247,430,26119,279,77480,1917,11,358,1440,832,430,8104,15785,279,1455,38291,37643,13,578,11341,315,459,19428,55801,53460,44087,1113,323,30517,287,279,29079,742,13,6104,1063,15763,279,13444,315,279,57891,11,3885,57791,1633,3958,8019,729,11,1778,439,279,19163,315,36277,25981,477,279,4648,315,97583,84718,7931,13,1219,1441,3810,279,6237,13,49113,323,58909,11,3432,358,617,279,16044,323,26632,315,33018,499,311,220,3080,47,921,3431,372,869,12279,9431,27236,9509,13,2030,1095,596,387,10978,11,584,649,5042,1650,433,220,3080,47,477,1524,921,22185,369,1884,3345,311,603,13,19173,11,18083,13,574,12153,311,387,3118,3432,13,3011,596,3249,358,3358,1456,311,94176,53875,1148,1364,3309,757,13,5321,5296,430,18083,13,374,539,1633,10882,449,23348,627,198,6153,5899,1667,315,5944,11,1057,37513,22477,16870,27625,11,1057,3361,60630,11,706,7946,12457,459,10877,13,1666,499,649,1518,11,6385,67344,706,11928,311,16805,279,8970,315,1077,4851,13,362,21655,315,10054,323,16174,13,578,58587,72255,388,690,2019,430,220,3080,47,374,4400,810,1109,264,2466,5041,315,19108,120
