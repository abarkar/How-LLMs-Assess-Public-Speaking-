The speaker is discussing their research on the persecution and deportation of gay men during World War II, specifically focusing on the experiences of those who were sent to concentration camps.\n\nThe speaker begins by referencing a quote from Virginia Woolf about knowing many people in one's life, but most of whom are dead. They then reflect on how they have also lost friends due to their inability to cross certain streets (a metaphor for the difficulties and dangers faced by LGBTQ+ individuals).\n\nThe speaker goes on to describe the harsh conditions faced by gay men in concentration camps, including forced labor and violence at the hands of Nazi guards. They express their disgust and nausea at learning about these events through historical records, but also their determination to honor the memories of those who were lost.\n\nThe speaker then discusses their research into the literary works of writers who experienced persecution during this time period. They describe how they have \"redesigned\" the faces and eyes of these individuals, essentially bringing them back to life through literature. The speaker's passion for their work is palpable, as they express a desire to break the silence surrounding these events and share their findings with others.\n\nThe final message of the speaker is one of warning: that the dark hours of history could potentially return if people are not vigilant in protecting human rights and combating discrimination. They conclude by emphasizing the importance of remembering and learning from the past, and using literature as a means to \"break the silence\" and bring these events back into the light.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,14465,757,5945,10176,729,294,31109,17571,409,13286,47400,69,13,622,34155,4635,84,48488,409,48577,7010,7643,17536,13,5034,628,455,472,294,6,40997,84568,15132,10237,288,13,11876,46106,11,4864,3625,16796,824,1072,288,66021,1744,4864,308,34155,6502,15925,1208,5457,409,30517,261,1208,56949,13,6178,72,11,503,34155,55162,10036,30517,261,20662,56949,13,622,34155,55162,10036,60946,265,87320,220,868,220,931,28408,61244,84764,1188,24560,7591,403,5512,7010,3625,29135,409,29449,20545,13,29124,66,2182,89,11,90053,409,17317,11,9189,326,6,306,73602,949,9648,414,409,17317,11,3900,379,264,514,21847,13,62463,53542,11,41518,355,7010,3625,32118,438,417,409,326,6,90446,11,46152,14848,24560,7591,403,5512,7010,951,29135,409,20545,13,445,6496,1481,300,11,514,42775,1826,19259,519,7010,3625,1841,462,31539,13,11876,4020,1725,409,5634,969,593,951,18679,7245,84,688,1765,3625,4046,331,1572,2126,65,14014,13,11876,2107,2469,71151,3625,16806,11,10071,46152,841,834,306,55455,13,27058,62998,949,4366,346,934,85217,5320,29580,71686,23589,265,3869,29449,9880,13,12623,4864,41380,2852,27750,46681,409,326,6,90446,11,1880,5636,503,49152,2852,1208,4415,355,8047,13,14465,308,6,1138,344,2852,6502,3869,69379,265,3625,60053,11,3625,82113,8467,409,27750,7591,403,5512,13,14465,308,6,306,408,2852,35597,1744,514,21847,13,1708,1105,11,4864,757,36731,259,3514,978,5553,1208,60642,14081,1598,13,19421,272,17771,28463,514,70927,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,622,34155,8666,978,951,2960,33903,1880,951,2960,33903,294,6,283,19456,1154,1765,1208,7591,403,367,28408,31037,13,81245,87651,5808,1188,3869,1647,16536,4618,27750,7591,403,5512,13,6178,72,11,4864,841,348,11206,2852,6502,1744,7643,60120,325,45441,17475,13215,8047,32592,326,49455,301,409,1208,305,8511,13,622,34155,93974,1880,503,34155,93974,27750,6959,13,622,34155,912,2496,72,13,100178,11,35597,294,81979,6959,13,19421,74699,11,46152,15132,39015,13,622,34155,2579,434,258,978,3625,326,4558,85,417,13,622,34155,2579,434,258,978,3625,20043,2249,409,27750,7591,403,5512,13,81245,15132,409,1055,355,11083,1448,31539,13,46706,653,4046,10946,409,11939,11,409,30481,1744,1208,60642,14081,1598,757,29557,83,1339,11,4864,3625,16796,63034,5512,7010,3625,46496,13,19421,46152,296,6,546,44314,978,13,19421,503,6,25632,12339,68226,9189,20028,97448,75804,88253,7643,11939,5019,3846,42775,13,356,17771,653,42775,11,4864,5534,2852,11,294,6,1132,978,38469,60642,76743,556,13,7695,6824,68,11,9189,514,23933,10333,3846,21847,11,41091,503,34155,6233,648,409,514,1437,12329,13,622,34155,6233,648,409,69241,9779,514,21847,1370,951,78199,13,19421,26725,3625,78199,7930,757,87651,77065,3869,326,6,461,4618,11,26725,3625,78199,1744,4864,41380,7010,27750,10083,598,11,503,34155,6233,648,409,3625,22641,261,294,6,370,541,665,41091,1880,76826,409,9189,3625,20028,97448,13,62463,53542,2922,6496,11,46152,841,15132,6502,60019,10237,82,13,81245,3073,306,13,81245,15132,7010,12155,1495,288,13,81245,15132,7010,3625,47289,6489,625,1154,13,81245,15132,7010,26725,3625,78199,934,85217,14848,1208,1056,5512,13,34447,6666,13,58201,321,685,13,62463,76145,1794,65,417,5019,969,1188,19443,404,15878,1744,54613,841,274,41901,264,716,20822,535,13,19421,45575,11,39043,87264,22299,6316,38883,523,2070,409,628,2925,1437,285,519,42067,4046,566,266,519,13612,321,294,6,39883,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2028,8111,311,387,264,36815,315,264,22066,1495,11,4461,505,264,10017,477,15864,13,578,19114,374,25394,872,3495,389,279,56529,323,59371,315,8485,3026,2391,4435,5111,8105,11,11951,21760,389,279,11704,315,1884,889,1051,3288,311,20545,29135,627,198,791,19114,12302,555,57616,264,12929,505,13286,47400,69,922,14392,1690,1274,304,832,596,2324,11,719,1455,315,8884,527,5710,13,2435,1243,8881,389,1268,814,617,1101,5675,4885,4245,311,872,38550,311,5425,3738,14708,320,64,46450,369,279,27129,323,37064,17011,555,51042,10,7931,570,198,198,791,19114,5900,389,311,7664,279,25984,4787,17011,555,8485,3026,304,20545,29135,11,2737,9770,9511,323,9349,520,279,6206,315,32527,27270,13,2435,3237,872,68162,323,61880,520,6975,922,1521,4455,1555,13970,7576,11,719,1101,872,26314,311,16044,279,19459,315,1884,889,1051,5675,627,198,791,19114,1243,35434,872,3495,1139,279,32465,4375,315,16483,889,10534,56529,2391,420,892,4261,13,2435,7664,1268,814,617,330,1171,288,1571,1,279,12580,323,6548,315,1521,7931,11,16168,12967,1124,1203,311,2324,1555,17649,13,578,19114,596,11939,369,872,990,374,75649,481,11,439,814,3237,264,12876,311,1464,279,21847,14932,1521,4455,323,4430,872,14955,449,3885,627,198,791,1620,1984,315,279,19114,374,832,315,10163,25,430,279,6453,4207,315,3925,1436,13893,471,422,1274,527,539,81334,304,22973,3823,3268,323,96178,21934,13,2435,32194,555,82003,279,12939,315,48384,323,6975,505,279,3347,11,323,1701,17649,439,264,3445,311,330,9137,279,21847,1,323,4546,1521,4455,1203,1139,279,3177,13,128009],"total_duration":10840593206,"load_duration":268958,"prompt_eval_count":688,"prompt_eval_duration":1290238000,
