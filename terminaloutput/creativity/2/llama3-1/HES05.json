They use a phone as an example, saying that if they were to open their hand and let their phone fall, it would likely land on the floor or even break. This illustrates how we all use our ability to predict consequences (projection) in everyday life, especially when making decisions.\n\nThe speaker then shifts gears to discuss planning, which is the main theme of their thesis. They explain that historically, planning has been a fundamental domain of artificial intelligence, enabling the creation of robots like Opportunity, which was an autonomous robot sent to Mars in 2004 and operated for 15 years before being shut down.\n\nHowever, the speaker notes that Opportunity's plan only worked because it was operating in a predetermined environment with no external factors. In contrast, their own work aims to develop planning in a dynamic and unknown environment, leveraging the human brain's three key mechanisms:\n\n1. Force of habit: We often perform complex actions without thinking, as we've done them many times before.\n2. Economy of intellectual energy: We tend to take the path of least resistance, choosing solutions that are good enough rather than optimal.\n3. Dynamic planning: The world is constantly evolving, and our plans must adapt to these changes.\n\nThe speaker then takes a call from their thesis advisor, ending their presentation abruptly!
