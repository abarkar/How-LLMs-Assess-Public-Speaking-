The researcher is discussing their work on characterizing an ideal thermal insulator for buildings that can be made from local materials, produces no waste, stores carbon, and can be recycled indefinitely.\n\nThe researcher mentions three ingredients: soil (specifically, the researcher is studying different types of clay), hemp fibers, and water. They describe how they have been collecting soil samples from different locations in Brittany and Normandy to study their properties and behavior, and how they have also been working with hemp producers to understand the characteristics of different types of hemp.\n\nThe researcher explains that by combining these three ingredients in different proportions, they can create a range of materials with varying levels of thermal insulation, mechanical strength, and moisture management. They are currently developing a simple test for building sites that will allow construction professionals to quickly determine which materials and quantities to use to achieve the desired performance characteristics.\n\nThe tone of the transcript is informal and conversational, with the researcher using colloquialisms and playful language to engage their audience. The text includes phrases such as \"Souvenez-vous, enfants\" (a playful way to begin the presentation) and \"Ok, premier ingr√©dient\" (a nod to a game show). Overall, the transcript appears to be an inspiring and enthusiastic account of the researcher's work on developing sustainable building materials.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,9424,1055,10333,45325,11,60404,11,3625,86696,281,64272,5512,3869,1208,86451,949,61651,14707,41091,11,503,41901,16796,20272,1647,42775,13,14465,39904,1208,4647,12583,978,409,11083,503,3514,14014,11,3625,69236,7010,1208,30870,68,11,3869,20028,951,86696,281,64272,5512,13,19421,4864,3625,84921,9952,51625,1854,13,36684,58673,2249,409,38317,13263,3869,57705,978,6091,261,653,13399,519,30945,2428,887,63497,5019,514,293,64272,3904,13,7695,42182,23761,514,5636,91329,1640,2428,1880,514,5636,2804,519,3284,13,1952,25692,514,9765,462,16339,1685,593,961,412,1765,10335,265,11,9952,71686,56321,81336,15433,4167,11,1744,326,54386,46524,64,44093,1353,54960,13,7695,841,54206,85624,7591,40213,11,3900,5708,68,48488,409,1841,20337,11,1880,665,5636,11,389,25692,514,1421,10993,3869,326,52152,5589,72,13,356,17771,3709,3433,481,758,27058,47929,3846,1744,272,17771,11,28068,2439,3869,1208,3488,5019,653,7643,53510,13,7777,11,21134,81336,15433,1188,13,7054,758,3489,301,5634,28154,2933,409,8246,44260,496,1604,11,57485,3869,1208,37291,7010,1208,8309,52009,409,921,483,1880,7010,514,523,69628,2933,409,650,92512,14081,569,11,1826,264,4972,72,4382,11,10071,25945,6485,68,11,1841,25945,3977,949,507,2005,11,1208,88026,1589,361,13,46706,11083,58673,2249,11,4864,326,57286,664,648,3869,96642,4046,331,37907,5019,665,7591,23827,261,15907,40321,1821,11,81186,3625,1417,3742,13,3459,37854,14480,7138,66601,13,7777,11,26633,90272,81336,15433,1188,13,7054,758,3489,6853,628,5048,11,15890,3625,16178,417,14848,55505,3869,1208,59251,951,23125,1154,951,5636,94527,293,349,12249,11,264,653,36271,7930,513,282,3972,5986,978,43310,949,507,2005,11,97507,11,514,27114,49606,13,362,326,55624,57663,409,1208,259,7404,11,389,71451,409,98385,2598,2482,594,28111,519,8065,66304,11,25945,73083,31539,11,1841,7245,1572,409,4247,437,13109,13,356,17771,84568,7930,1469,90332,546,514,68226,13399,519,13,2009,490,1791,11,272,17771,934,35329,379,264,8065,40970,3154,519,409,27114,49606,1744,409,35641,13,1708,1105,11,5019,3625,44178,63934,1291,11,503,57286,664,648,1208,62827,951,2598,2482,1880,28130,23878,13109,3869,15938,655,409,326,93847,13,44031,5317,978,3869,29449,8348,13532,25253,81336,15433,1188,11,326,93847,11,17317,64290,2439,3846,934,54386,917,6853,6316,88026,682,19395,8047,13,43987,26178,11,4068,14240,664,1291,3625,24601,409,20662,88026,682,19395,8047,15878,20028,951,2606,81560,409,32118,5317,288,11,10071,665,864,52985,665,42463,20662,9765,1130,817,21797,13109,949,61651,14707,11,41091,7930,86807,100196,11,503,34155,20272,653,68082,13,622,34155,52579,11083,11176,288,1880,7643,281,6853,11,1880,4864,36731,79988,3869,30517,43905,1208,72777,24812,1880,1208,20935,438,648,11,2536,6502,5019,3625,9517,41546,321,1291,11,10071,5019,9517,2119,466,220,966,2024,417,1744,503,34155,87885,2353,14014,8065,2092,11,65735,653,1760,511,1286,51625,285,5019,665,7591,23827,261,28130,52962,1133,11,665,34501,409,28130,259,1994,324,665,384,2933,13,14465,757,38831,83384,35597,9952,951,86696,281,64272,5512,13,34447,1208,44178,16271,9952,41091,11,16968,46110,11,272,17771,1744,503,34155,20272,951,4043,2852,665,9511,67763,5019,15522,3212,4839,1133,87320,1647,46110,281,64272,978,259,1188,6033,6502,13,41757,412,978,10253,46681,951,2027,38647,409,27114,49606,11,503,34155,45575,409,75249,90194,951,2024,417,1880,951,27114,85,417,10253,52962,3808,25945,85114,13,19421,39015,11,69428,758,14465,757,38831,83384,9952,220,20,2024,417,91678,5983,409,16968,326,88766,3121,1880,220,18,27114,85,417,91678,5983,409,43905,1208,9822,13,62293,11083,2024,417,1880,11083,27114,85,417,73661,552,11,4864,59157,1082,951,32118,5317,288,11,44829,503,57286,664,648,43153,24601,13,39783,5899,361,32118,4919,2428,89646,11,653,68226,13399,519,8065,1948,11,1880,6316,23878,13109,3869,342,52424,326,6,28400,307,13109,4046,4791,5392,5048,13,27058,1089,7889,326,6,18168,409,11083,58673,2249,11,1647,46494,274,6,27153,361,7010,514,60697,409,88817,8696,5293,5983,13,7695,18916,332,81186,951,100130,13,1708,1105,5019,1913,404,11,10362,1082,1765,514,88026,2933,11,4864,42775,273,1180,77776,3869,52895,716,653,4382,1296,409,44453,1291,7930,29557,2221,409,7591,23827,261,934,2053,86374,4298,2249,1880,665,74940,10484,13109,23761,42587,5512,5019,40192,404,27750,24601,13,5034,88026,1589,361,1880,3625,16178,417,348,19395,978,2629,645,15132,951,86374,4298,2249,42587,5512,41199,1208,85434,951,27138,13,34447,3625,14240,664,1291,17317,68061,625,306,6316,14896,13,5034,21797,13109,1826,653,54829,704,321,5019,19477,52750,326,6,5389,404,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,791,1495,8111,311,387,264,36815,315,459,7274,477,15864,555,264,32185,889,374,3318,389,11469,264,22556,323,42688,22658,4857,3769,13,578,32185,374,25394,872,990,389,3752,4954,459,10728,29487,1672,10733,369,14016,430,649,387,1903,505,2254,7384,11,19159,912,12571,11,10756,12782,11,323,649,387,47658,56334,627,198,791,32185,34945,2380,14293,25,17614,320,52340,750,11,279,32185,374,21630,2204,4595,315,371
