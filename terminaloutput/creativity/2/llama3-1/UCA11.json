{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-11-19T14:08:23.102063541Z","response":"It seems that you have provided a transcript of a talk or presentation about the concept of \"infraction-obstacle\" (which roughly translates to \"anticipatory punishment\" or \"pre-crime prevention\"). The speaker discusses the idea of a future society where crimes are prevented by anticipating and punishing individuals who might commit them, based on their potential behavior. The concept is often associated with the movie Minority Report, which was inspired by Philip K. Dick's short story.\n\nThe speaker argues that this approach to crime prevention is not entirely new, as modern societies already have measures in place to anticipate and prevent certain types of criminal activity. However, they also highlight the risks involved in adopting a more proactive approach to crime prevention, such as the potential erosion of individual liberties and the need for careful balancing between security and freedom.\n\nThe transcript includes several key points, including:\n\n1. The concept of \"infraction-obstacle\" is not new, but rather an extension of existing measures aimed at preventing criminal activity.\n2. The idea is to anticipate and punish individuals who might commit crimes based on their potential behavior.\n3. This approach raises questions about the limits of individual liberties and the need for careful balancing between security and freedom.\n4. The speaker's work aims to establish a general theory around the concept of \"infraction-obstacle,\" including defining it, identifying which types of infractions fall under this category, and studying its practical application.\n\nOverall, the transcript provides an overview of the concept of \"infraction-obstacle\" and the potential implications for individual liberties and societal security.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,362,19610,45325,46939,69379,84,89504,409,326,6,13885,16597,93549,44698,949,11842,949,13789,11,45575,1081,268,3209,2439,1370,6316,38920,88411,409,23423,8047,13,38891,89,6316,77824,3938,11,10071,6502,21965,781,396,8511,11,7010,1208,88265,3900,308,59858,44521,1339,5636,409,9349,11,5636,409,7591,3817,447,685,11,5636,409,24020,68,13,39783,77824,39587,7010,1208,88265,17317,308,6,4202,2439,5636,3869,1207,404,951,4046,5287,958,1083,4893,409,955,220,1954,4520,77807,37093,74687,514,9977,308,58736,1601,1339,5636,13,12535,949,2895,66096,3869,1208,82291,11,7930,29557,30532,294,6,1138,5615,466,653,23496,84,409,85722,16961,8047,11,87451,37953,934,54386,264,9517,16080,3869,4538,665,31400,8657,285,64656,294,6,29982,1392,7930,29557,73468,294,31769,74199,404,934,35329,29253,653,10025,593,36875,13327,409,59157,8082,294,31109,4225,16597,13,445,6,13885,16597,308,26248,27584,6502,3869,23761,7591,23827,8047,1236,6,93772,294,31109,4046,688,940,13109,29557,294,6,77196,72684,6316,45361,281,10610,1604,27389,688,535,13,1708,1105,4864,63762,3846,1744,9189,9189,294,3695,13,62408,13356,18111,324,17194,1826,12266,75804,88253,5253,83,5019,61512,11,9189,514,3665,89,11,17317,18434,2439,7010,653,38900,7930,348,1082,3869,326,6,360,2221,10039,40241,13,19421,514,64079,281,10610,278,7010,29449,77824,11,7930,7591,5098,483,3846,7930,1826,12553,635,6033,3900,416,635,11,8541,25400,28463,5553,3846,63669,294,6,8322,49686,13,19421,3900,97487,1744,3846,45441,55162,10036,1370,6316,25626,48901,951,55467,5168,788,665,294,2182,89,949,1183,12416,14707,13,29124,83,664,919,40126,3625,9517,4109,3435,8467,1880,32118,8747,266,8467,7930,4046,1195,16149,3869,1208,16578,294,22827,52309,266,13,5034,55133,3488,7930,513,17477,1826,27058,62998,42067,23496,84,11,4635,84,951,3600,409,4379,11,5019,951,86696,326,8362,1354,6033,5019,274,93825,18336,69068,11,43989,57375,44093,665,22848,978,949,1952,3567,72,408,14687,39587,8818,17194,33670,27584,294,49152,13603,945,72,732,17771,665,16968,4865,6316,23423,8047,961,351,8047,1370,653,6800,13026,409,3613,275,2303,729,1880,409,12155,4294,4893,3435,8467,11,7930,4263,306,1880,4046,14717,69625,3625,781,285,13,19421,272,17771,3846,7930,1120,57609,326,31769,1195,29355,1880,514,82620,11,41199,514,83259,3930,30388,68,97739,9326,11,409,42067,704,321,16422,307,2428,9721,519,934,17771,326,6,13885,16597,93549,44698,13,2009,64079,281,10610,278,841,513,71080,5636,45575,70374,3869,45361,1215,11,10071,44767,3869,21945,466,3625,82134,52962,3808,3869,46932,265,8231,39904,7364,3869,7364,294,31109,34501,65461,60224,3869,6316,34501,20862,64829,13,356,13059,519,11,653,38847,1826,3869,70375,5019,1370,3716,556,514,82620,409,3846,32118,4919,44618,13,5034,5790,263,5979,367,409,12155,97222,21901,2908,12249,8065,9859,409,1208,11347,265,36959,68,77463,88661,361,5253,83,379,74533,5392,788,9517,301,1001,550,5615,2641,949,356,17771,49733,1744,11083,58673,2249,864,7521,306,2035,13,445,41901,3841,84,1826,294,31769,74199,404,6316,76680,30303,46680,46140,90053,409,326,6,13885,16597,93549,44698,11,1208,7591,5589,404,11,4046,2470,52424,26077,645,49276,5247,14848,7010,3846,60697,11,14240,664,1291,28130,3851,95234,1880,665,7591,23827,261,43153,57705,978,2889,8467,13,1611,39015,11,4864,5019,41098,4046,6414,3913,62321,1880,12108,26077,645,15132,3625,4017,288,73083,3916,7930,841,56311,1880,76776,841,97569,23761,704,265,6519,14014,7010,326,6,19010,4422,367,409,3846,955,294,6,13885,16597,74687,15878,9517,12287,290,1765,3846,70927,11,7010,326,6,5389,404,11,326,6,13885,16597,93549,44698,92215,23761,16898,30885,8047,9952,6316,79036,409,6667,68,665,58617,409,12155,46681,1880,409,12155,17320,17274,645,665,48234,294,31769,74199,404,5019,95917,359,294,6,40997,17317,85114,2848,8839,3869,10025,593,13,41621,326,26248,554,89,13550,285,11,11083,58673,2249,274,6,1354,5192,81541,39587,7010,6316,8335,738,5048,9465,9517,4099,1880,22848,978,13,5034,22848,978,11,5019,93224,554,11,14240,519,1208,67239,978,5019,95917,359,294,6,40997,17317,409,5293,261,3869,326,6,19010,4422,367,951,47371,4144,82,951,6155,1673,288,7930,274,6,77196,72684,546,1880,274,98279,20672,546,3869,17317,7010,326,6,5389,404,3587,68,9189,312,1195,25134,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2181,5084,430,499,617,3984,264,36815,315,264,3137,477,15864,922,279,7434,315,330,13885,16597,93549,44698,1,320,8370,17715,48018,311,330,8322,575,5382,25060,1,477,330,1762,48689,547,27344,1865,578,19114,35434,279,4623,315,264,3938,8396,1405,17073,527,32098,555,86359,323,75986,7931,889,2643,5379,1124,11,3196,389,872,4754,7865,13,578,7434,374,3629,5938,449,279,5818,71158,8423,11,902,574,14948,555,26241,735,13,23373,596,2875,3446,627,198,791,19114,29633,430,420,5603,311,9977,27344,374,539,11622,502,11,439,6617,34775,2736,617,11193,304,2035,311,48248,323,5471,3738,4595,315,9337,5820,13,4452,11,814,1101,11415,279,15635,6532,304,48810,264,810,59314,5603,311,9977,27344,11,1778,439,279,4754,58097,315,3927,58455,323,279,1205,369,16994,44463,1990,
