Here's a summary of the text:\n\nThe speaker, a psychologist, describes an ideal world where parents have access to personal services like a private chauffeur, bodyguard, stylist, chef who prepares their favorite meals, and a friendly banker who finances their crazy projects while ensuring they're always happy. This \"enfance\" (youth) is where all these extraordinary people (parents) come together.\n\nThe speaker notes that psychologists have long blamed parents for all the world's woes, but few investigate how parents themselves experience parenthood. In our culture, there's an expectation that parenting should be a positive experience, with young parents receiving congratulations and gifts. However, being a parent is exhausting, leading many mothers and fathers to feel isolated and burnt out.\n\nResearch shows that parents are more likely to experience burnout than high-powered executives! The consequences of parental burnout are severe: increased conflicts, violence, neglect, and abuse affecting not only the children but also couples and entire families.\n\nAs a psychologist, the speaker's role is to predict and prevent parental burnout. They've developed a prevention program aimed at giving parents serenity, choice, and satisfaction. In the program, they teach techniques for stress management, mindfulness, and emotional regulation through workshops.\n\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention, the speaker takes small hair samples from participants before and after the program to measure cortisol levels (a marker of chronic stress) and quantify improvements in their overall well-being.\n\nThe speaker concludes that no one is taught how to be a good parent in school, so they strive to find solutions through their work.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,38891,89,653,11159,1370,543,51453,7010,514,43014,9189,26725,28490,89,294,22827,74817,12844,6223,978,11,294,22827,22641,3675,3930,34922,11,294,22827,18078,65746,11,294,22827,31547,258,1291,7930,27389,3462,5019,9189,26725,26317,628,1900,27389,69,14081,5512,1880,294,22827,9120,33571,22176,64,7930,17452,26317,22040,1441,3625,5636,282,788,1880,7930,513,27389,14310,86577,1744,9189,779,9188,89,44093,77818,2249,13,356,295,11159,11,76190,2439,31307,326,41901,69,685,13,19421,40744,27750,48577,64555,17724,11,76190,2439,12,645,6699,13,4241,9425,951,35881,2734,552,11,3625,8841,1640,1157,14848,84788,72,3869,17780,8977,1208,4294,87782,409,16968,514,8811,383,324,3930,38900,10253,6699,13,356,13059,519,11,25945,28800,409,76305,75460,274,55624,978,676,306,3869,4068,3625,6699,11,84440,11,18434,306,28130,46679,13109,13,46706,29449,7829,11,3900,379,264,6316,1651,6960,5019,1744,1208,46679,13109,45441,44093,13,39783,88411,6928,13,11876,60120,6699,312,20822,81541,951,503,337,552,7558,288,11,951,58482,6154,811,1880,84871,409,86696,78418,12249,296,625,2439,13,11876,60404,15132,16265,8839,11,39587,3625,6699,3567,969,1188,23761,3625,5636,77818,2249,3930,38900,13,356,8458,1826,83195,11,10071,6502,16968,514,27138,13,2998,59157,13109,11,23761,2748,11,39043,36709,13,64105,64,36709,3869,19227,1486,1744,409,5636,665,5636,409,33820,598,1880,409,26365,300,308,6,1138,81541,5636,3869,513,75802,88778,5512,13,81245,274,31769,652,285,306,13,5034,38317,20605,265,27584,934,85217,274,31769,652,285,306,5636,1744,3625,53542,294,82405,17724,13,41621,62299,6350,285,949,9424,688,11,3625,6699,84440,1474,5615,9004,841,11427,306,6502,934,85217,5945,544,8135,409,8395,9994,46679,13,11876,1615,978,45045,409,8395,9994,46679,15132,25945,19266,85,31539,13,12623,409,83977,1220,11,5636,409,4738,2436,11,5636,409,38605,6200,343,2436,1880,409,8811,30532,3095,13,350,519,5019,326,41901,61827,11,3625,21961,11,3625,2138,31355,1218,59307,13,3206,436,57332,665,37622,1744,8841,77828,6824,68,3869,550,15433,556,13,19421,3869,27389,43406,326,53149,9425,1133,951,6699,13,62293,11083,4631,4558,70,1157,11,17317,57038,390,79884,653,18629,409,27389,7611,7930,348,1082,3869,2579,263,1215,10253,6699,409,1208,274,14081,10610,13109,11,3930,60020,11,409,1208,24617,13,33150,45369,294,6,84426,4918,11,503,6,57379,3625,6699,3869,917,9484,265,951,12823,409,59471,3930,8631,11,409,7245,483,42563,11,409,59471,951,4046,76,41356,61907,3742,13,34447,4068,47929,1744,1647,21623,1826,31914,580,949,61651,14707,11,4864,57625,4618,7010,1208,83067,951,6699,13,41621,5019,7379,89,9189,13510,11,12769,11876,8841,1640,1157,11,39587,11,272,17771,4725,13,8345,34447,4864,1239,42441,28463,43153,3091,588,2249,13,27058,4046,838,8977,326,6,6581,292,582,13109,409,20662,21623,11,4864,28130,550,19010,79351,951,98385,296,4558,8696,409,3091,588,2249,33670,1880,3869,1208,1913,3930,18629,5019,93455,514,9637,2249,409,89942,2107,6374,556,11,75467,324,3930,8631,27076,2428,11,1880,10484,3125,326,58591,73511,7769,409,28130,14240,266,409,77323,1880,409,14707,85815,13,1952,308,53149,9484,6502,3869,326,31769,56745,3869,23761,653,7970,2748,13,24703,87264,951,14707,21965,1317,1157,14240,29246,11,25692,85815,27584,4225,258,552,13,356,17771,87320,7010,11083,58673,2249,11,503,6,434,61055,409,46524,951,10105,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,32,27387,36815,0,5810,596,264,12399,315,279,1495,512,198,791,19114,11,264,54595,11,16964,459,10728,1917,1405,6699,617,2680,311,4443,3600,1093,264,879,74817,12844,11,2547,27190,11,67473,11,30806,889,48542,872,7075,21644,11,323,264,11919,72759,889,40382,872,14599,7224,1418,23391,814,2351,2744,6380,13,1115,330,268,69,685,1,320,88,2969,8,374,1405,682,1521,24674,1274,320,26534,8,2586,3871,627,198,791,19114,8554,430,74191,617,1317,36197,6699,369,682,279,1917,596,77825,11,719,2478,19874,1268,6699,5694,3217,39040,32968,13,763,1057,7829,11,1070,596,459,31293,430,49058,1288,387,264,6928,3217,11,449,3995,6699,12588,82644,323,21258,13,4452,11,1694,264,2748,374,79953,11,6522,1690,27698,323,40317,311,2733,25181,323,50440,704,627,198,28528,5039,430,6699,527,810,4461,311,3217,8395,412,1109,1579,41503,29509,0,578,16296,315,46679,8395,412,527,15748,25,7319,26885,11,9349,11,39332,11,323,11737,28987,539,1193,279,2911,719,1101,21961,323,4553,8689,627,198,2170,264,54595,11,279,19114,596,3560,374,311,7168,323,5471,46679,8395,412,13,2435,3077,8040,264,27344,2068,20034,520,7231,6699,1446,56685,11,5873,11,323,24617,13,763,279,2068,11,814,4639,12823,369,8631,6373,11,71705,11,323,14604,19812,1555,35936,627,198,1271,15806,279,27375,315,420,21623,11,279,19114,5097,2678,7013,10688,505,13324,1603,323,1306,279,2068,311,6767,89942,5990,320,64,11381,315,21249,8631,8,323,76498,18637,304,872,8244,1664,33851,627,198,791,19114,45537,430,912,832,374,15972,1268,311,387,264,1695,2748,304,2978,11,779,814,37106,311,1505,10105,1555,872,990,13,128009],"total_duration":11141126852,"load_duration":354005,"prompt_eval_count":672,"prompt_eval
