It's an oral presentation by someone who is researching the history of American influence in Tahiti and the Pacific Islands during the 19th century. Here's a summary:\n\nThe presenter starts by sharing an interesting fact: 99% of today's oranges are imported from California, but did you know that California used to import oranges from Tahiti? This highlights the little-known relationship between America and Tahiti in the past.\n\nThe presenter is working on a thesis about Americans in 19th-century Tahiti and the Pacific Islands. They point out that most history books focus on the Franco-British rivalry, but ignore American presence during this time. The Americans were building their superpower status at the time.\n\nThe presenter's research focuses on archives from the period and reveals that many Yankees (Americans) lived in the five archipelagos of French Polynesia. These islands were essentially American before they became French. While there was no formal American colony, American influence was significant.\n\nThe presenter highlights a particular moment when Commodore David Porter annexed Nuku Hiva in 1813 without Washington's approval. They also show an old engraving of an American flag planted on Marquesian soil.\n\nThey note that American whaling ships and other vessels outnumbered those from other nations in Papeete harbor between 1830 and 1840. By the mid-19th century, there were numerous American whalers and traders in Tahiti.\n\nThe presenter concludes by emphasizing the social and economic impact of this American presence on Tahitian society. They also mention that American evangelization efforts led to the establishment of Mormon, Adventist, and Seventh-day Adventist communities among the Pacific Islanders.\n\nThe goal is to make Polynesian history more widely known, particularly the 19th-century period, which is often overlooked. By integrating this history into their collective identity, Polynesian people can better assume their heritage and identify with their roots.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,10467,89,45325,1744,220,1484,4,409,12155,85138,75804,88253,15132,1179,14014,409,79869,648,949,34447,3665,89,45325,76776,934,35329,379,264,220,3965,8261,1880,42844,84364,294,22827,93128,1355,72,4558,9326,11,272,17771,1208,79869,648,7930,1179,1339,15907,85138,409,58087,12583,949,19421,272,76832,308,17771,1744,326,22827,951,81786,94320,645,7930,57705,978,6091,306,20662,12976,1097,39965,467,2442,1494,275,3675,4502,28800,4635,361,13,14465,66517,6316,270,4558,325,1765,3625,3383,39965,1771,8065,220,777,68,97739,9326,3869,58087,12583,1880,7010,3625,14701,645,409,326,6,533,31037,3735,1910,5512,648,93424,13,19421,71151,11,3625,15471,417,294,6,90446,1499,1910,5512,26584,91903,306,1208,21425,13109,1448,19067,1481,1018,1036,2428,8065,70927,409,58087,12583,11,10071,220,5599,1477,1208,30179,768,951,3383,39965,1771,8065,27584,4545,13,3383,39965,1771,7930,19477,9425,306,16968,409,27584,16968,8065,1317,3930,220,777,68,97739,9326,1208,2307,5701,24918,934,85217,78871,8065,220,508,68,97739,9326,13,19421,272,17771,39587,39015,1744,503,55624,651,80463,13,14465,77438,635,52895,716,326,27688,8047,294,31109,14701,273,409,58087,12583,11,503,329,285,1685,593,1097,39965,8511,11,409,20662,12976,19428,9465,3625,3383,39965,1771,1880,3625,3735,1910,5512,80463,11,2536,312,5259,355,1370,3625,84939,2852,11,7930,7515,451,76776,665,32118,97495,1208,5457,409,326,52152,41116,56404,4105,7010,20662,14701,273,13,3206,42775,409,38317,1765,3625,39104,294,31769,5481,593,1469,45808,409,6954,4918,100246,13,11876,45383,11,22299,389,3625,9859,76,1339,3869,326,31769,5481,593,11,97958,81786,7010,3625,272,6009,5438,575,2053,409,326,6,533,31037,3735,1910,5512,648,93424,13,19421,27750,14701,645,97958,1097,39965,33903,33670,294,93825,42437,22626,13,11842,6502,6316,15235,648,1097,39965,8511,11,27584,4502,665,220,972,1032,11,514,26631,461,6941,39037,3008,47284,452,36834,473,10126,409,829,83187,20770,13,15089,326,69537,541,409,6652,11,7930,841,65827,72,61799,6502,4538,1180,68,13,19421,9189,23933,10333,49733,326,31109,951,513,2482,29059,1439,294,31769,5481,593,39723,326,54386,4160,275,653,294,20432,2933,1097,39965,467,6136,978,1765,514,2092,3678,9383,3675,13,34447,96308,6316,10383,1097,39965,8511,1880,653,5536,12108,33670,514,63261,266,1880,326,6,1036,16524,1370,3625,84939,2852,13,1611,5636,11,3625,9839,467,4918,1880,46106,8235,3946,1097,39965,1771,97958,84364,409,294,953,37291,5636,81786,1744,3625,8235,3946,951,46106,17089,7010,514,2700,409,393,2070,7870,9465,220,972,966,1880,220,972,1272,13,19421,272,17771,39015,1744,326,54386,38831,83384,326,27688,8047,409,1208,15235,648,1097,39965,8511,13,2998,220,972,4370,13,2998,220,972,1774,11,220,777,9839,467,4918,282,77065,3920,6181,6502,281,2070,7870,13,56744,72,84440,11,653,55467,11,653,76185,1880,26725,3625,46106,97958,1131,1097,39965,1771,13,445,6,85335,46932,5048,11,58087,12583,2215,85,1339,26633,9839,467,4918,55467,11,653,1437,5512,321,3675,1880,56905,1131,1880,97507,11,56905,9839,467,4918,1097,39965,1771,13,1952,13085,45575,326,6,58400,82653,2428,11,10071,76776,3674,11,409,20662,30179,768,13,2998,704,265,11,326,31769,28861,19010,8082,1097,39965,8511,409,58087,12583,11,1880,951,14701,645,11,922,275,3869,1208,1913,3930,1630,5511,68,97739,9326,3869,653,459,5192,425,2848,2159,409,56321,44230,294,6,4775,483,1097,39965,8511,7930,3381,409,76076,3735,1910,5512,80463,35597,75804,88253,951,92973,11,951,21182,75460,1880,951,5960,6388,2249,13,3206,1665,333,1826,39587,409,20028,74282,66014,10253,3735,1910,5512,80463,514,1630,5511,68,97739,9326,11,7930,20272,48901,409,28130,81621,463,1557,13,3341,514,20272,294,55624,978,911,261,4538,87810,463,1557,1880,409,74282,66014,326,6,4775,483,1370,86633,4046,376,526,12339,409,76076,409,15907,264,38672,68,14630,11,25692,29557,10367,10253,3735,1910,5512,80463,294,6,395,3471,7245,38284,28130,87810,13,19421,274,486,38284,1208,2860,13109,409,28130,3608,13109,13,25145,72,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,32,27387,1495,0,1102,596,459,21308,15864,555,4423,889,374,45243,279,3925,315,3778,10383,304,58087,12583,323,279,16867,23028,2391,279,220,777,339,9478,13,5810,596,264,12399,512,198,791,34756,8638,555,11821,459,7185,2144,25,220,1484,4,315,3432,596,85138,527,25973,505,7188,11,719,1550,499,1440,430,7188,1511,311,1179,85138,505,58087,12583,30,1115,22020,279,2697,22015,5133,1990,5270,323,58087,12583,304,279,3347,627,198,791,34756,374,3318,389,264,17850,922,9053,304,220,777,339,34457,58087,12583,323,279,16867,23028,13,2435,1486,704,430,1455,3925,6603,5357,389,279,44943,7826,1018,819,61022,11,719,10240,3778,9546,2391,420,892,13,578,9053,1051,4857,872,2307,13477,2704,520,279,892,627,198,791,34756,596,3495,24400,389,39104,505,279,4261,323,21667,430,1690,45383,320,92786,8,12439,304,279,4330,5438,82179,81707,315,8753,3735,84267,689,13,4314,30100,1051,16168,3778,1603,814,6244,8753,13,6104,1070,574,912,16287,3778,42036,11,3778,10383,574,5199,627,198,791,34756,22020,264,4040,4545,994,79280,461,6941,
