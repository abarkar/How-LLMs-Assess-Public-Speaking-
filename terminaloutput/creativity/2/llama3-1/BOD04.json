They propose using Minecraft as a virtual environment to study how humans make decisions in real-life scenarios, like deciding whether to buy bread from a bakery with a large dog outside. The speaker argues that this approach can help us understand how our brains work when we're faced with complex decision-making situations, such as traveling abroad and wanting to eat a baguette.\n\nThe transcript also includes the following points:\n\n* The importance of considering emotional factors in decision-making\n* The idea that humans are able to adapt quickly to new situations by using context-dependent reasoning\n* The potential for AI systems to learn from human brain function and behavior\n\nOverall, the speaker's thesis topic seems to be exploring the intersection of neuroscience and computer science to better understand how humans make decisions and how AI can learn from these processes.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,13789,30362,1880,31074,561,978,13,14465,36731,97717,1744,9189,47592,46939,69379,84,89504,409,1208,48659,9517,65272,7930,274,53149,6853,326,55624,8677,1989,1104,72,6853,11,1208,84850,4558,21152,44190,13,34447,841,9189,304,47391,978,668,89,6502,11,4864,841,91507,6502,4043,1155,409,9189,5804,467,846,1744,326,6,5987,11412,16968,30870,273,3078,261,7010,15265,17536,13,2998,20272,11,7643,270,4558,325,3613,68495,1208,48901,1208,5636,36897,409,326,6,5987,11,272,17771,514,358,11,326,55624,8677,13,38891,89,11,3900,1826,326,6,75876,3930,7591,3841,48137,11,9189,47592,2267,318,11,9189,12584,89,99490,6316,9145,84,6672,3869,1208,293,11206,4091,648,3930,16652,13,34447,665,69003,519,11,9189,23933,10333,934,35329,379,264,653,4046,20609,68,523,3675,3869,81337,409,1208,60172,409,1208,293,11206,4091,648,13,41621,47592,45575,45889,65995,409,2132,288,5019,35881,1814,11,1826,54312,934,54386,379,11412,6033,389,11412,23008,9211,6316,47838,293,11206,4091,648,653,28800,5636,78060,13,12095,4864,348,11206,2852,31807,3023,265,3846,80259,9952,6316,3057,1557,10748,479,66901,64829,11,4864,48888,2852,951,4046,447,811,7930,864,7521,306,665,42463,1647,53052,409,2267,318,11,1208,62827,3930,523,3675,11,274,35329,264,326,6,1334,60019,32118,11943,11,1208,6138,409,1208,293,11206,4091,648,46932,5048,11,5099,13,3341,3900,47090,14707,1744,7643,35881,1854,2109,974,13,19421,74699,11,1043,981,2439,1744,4864,9189,991,76,48099,46206,41091,665,2314,68,11,2145,2058,1647,2307,21935,13,34447,1647,4046,447,367,841,15572,68,5636,3930,16968,13,13789,11,55133,479,66021,1744,39015,1481,300,11,3900,348,2784,64972,513,32118,69,1291,409,26725,3625,26883,729,11,27584,3625,5636,86696,13,19421,76776,11,27584,4502,9189,47592,1208,6140,409,46524,6316,293,11206,4091,648,7930,20272,951,9145,14127,2392,11,1208,463,331,8511,35737,78705,55755,3869,951,2960,33903,409,15395,316,75104,13,34447,3846,308,17771,6502,25165,11,17317,682,2439,25945,83457,17317,13253,1880,389,11412,296,4091,12155,14135,36527,1880,7591,416,53819,13,25145,72,13,19421,7591,416,53819,2536,1280,80463,13,34447,87451,29449,54606,665,9822,11,389,312,59976,12155,17536,31355,6183,21237,1880,12155,9145,14127,2392,13,356,17771,12,6496,1773,556,934,54386,308,6,283,2067,648,6502,1208,70311,4046,447,367,11,10071,17317,17317,11142,2439,665,34501,3930,2317,68,13,2582,11,9189,1880,41091,11,77433,3869,29449,49370,60217,333,9598,278,11,389,35456,3846,955,409,35881,1854,26725,3625,49301,9952,5882,40948,978,11,665,57110,52727,2515,91640,26725,27750,4742,31539,11,2536,71686,66901,36527,11,10071,28463,4046,49975,36527,13,62293,3625,18247,8385,16549,288,11,7930,5363,306,96642,38682,919,409,20662,48901,3930,272,5976,2933,11,389,14240,664,648,4068,46152,83170,4558,8135,5019,71751,51794,479,1208,90509,13,34447,5019,38211,12155,4046,447,811,11,14707,97717,11,389,308,59858,11412,6502,665,2314,68,26725,3625,99309,5634,1354,9952,3625,18247,8385,16549,288,3869,1208,38317,294,31109,293,11206,4091,648,9952,951,26883,729,3869,326,6,24677,8047,13,27058,45602,11,389,69152,514,51655,57146,13,507,2005,11,17317,4186,19941,41330,22299,50026,40280,13053,4088,13,62293,3846,51655,11,4864,94297,7591,5589,404,951,13307,13,3959,86696,44190,11,22299,25400,11,7930,42587,306,1208,390,46302,951,18247,8385,16549,288,5019,71925,1992,951,33013,98942,409,35881,1854,13,19421,389,11412,68226,22842,3846,52962,1133,3663,3869,653,523,3675,13053,4088,77558,6316,293,11206,4091,648,13053,31037,13,19421,41091,11,1208,3488,1744,4864,757,17477,11,272,17771,934,17771,54312,7930,513,39904,7010,29449,272,5976,2933,42676,389,45640,665,2314,68,1880,389,76605,296,4091,6316,9145,84,6672,949,29179,321,6496,11,653,72006,70927,409,270,4558,325,3869,1208,4156,20712,951,18247,2445,12242,1880,409,326,52152,2293,2428,13,25145,72,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,32,27387,36815,4999,198,8586,596,264,12399,315,279,1495,512,198,791,19114,40019,5694,323,872,17850,8712,25,8830,279,3823,11478,13189,315,59294,22107,320,15836,570,2435,30714,1701,41330,439,264,4200,4676,311,4007,1268,12966,1304,11429,304,1972,26928,26350,11,1093,30230,3508,311,3780,16385,505,264,66244,449,264,3544,5679,4994,13,578,19114,29633,430,420,5603,649,1520,603,3619,1268,1057,35202,990,994,584,2351,17011,449,6485,5597,28846,15082,11,1778,439,21646,22917,323,19762,311,8343,264,9145,84,6672,627,198,791,36815,1101,5764,279,2768,3585,1473,9,578,12939,315,13126,14604,9547,304,5597,28846,198,9,578,4623,430,12966,527,3025,311,10737,6288,311,502,15082,555,1701,2317,43918,33811,198,9,578,4754,369,15592,6067,311,4048,505,3823,8271,734,323,7865,198,198,28589,11,279,19114,596,17850,8712,5084,311,387,24919,279,19801,315,93048,323,6500,8198,311,2731,3619,1268,12966,1304,11429,323,1268,15592,649,4048,505,1521,11618,13,128009],"total_duration":7314246923,"load_duration":649493,"prompt_eval_count":772,"prompt_eval_duration":1514148000,"eval_count":191,"eval_duration":5798706000}
