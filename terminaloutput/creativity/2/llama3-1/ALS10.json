It seems to be an excerpt from a lecture or presentation by an anthropologist, sharing their experiences and research on the Tibetan people living in the Himalayas.\n\nThe speaker begins by drawing parallels between their work as an anthropologist and the TV show \"Rendez-vous en terre inconnue\" (which translates to \"Meet Me in Unfamiliar Land\"), where a celebrity immerses themselves in the daily life of a remote population. The anthropologist notes that they too have had experiences similar to those on the show, but without the media spotlight.\n\nThe speaker then shares their own experience of living with a Tibetan family in the Himalayas for several months. They describe how they initially struggled to connect with the villagers, but eventually won them over through shared laughter and a willingness to learn their language.\n\nThe core of the presentation revolves around the anthropologist's research on traditional Tibetan medicine, specifically the evolution of medical knowledge from one generation to the next. The speaker highlights the differences between Yeshi, the elder doctor, who learned his trade from his father, and Norbu, the younger doctor, who received a more modern education in Western-style medicine.\n\nThe presentation also touches upon the theme of cultural innovation, as the younger doctor brings back new ideas and practices from his travels abroad. This has led to changes in the way traditional Tibetan medicine is practiced, with a greater emphasis on commercialization (e.g., selling medicinal incense to tourists).\n\nThroughout the transcript, I noticed a strong emphasis on the importance of understanding cultural evolution and change through firsthand experiences and observations. The speaker seems to be emphasizing that anthropology is not just about studying cultures from afar but rather immersing oneself in those cultures to gain a deeper understanding of what makes us human.\n\nOverall, this transcript offers a fascinating glimpse into the world of Tibetan culture and the practices of traditional medicine, as well as the importance of intergenerational knowledge transmission.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,7695,379,264,6316,4046,2796,43116,7930,274,53149,6853,12769,432,73602,45325,665,88026,304,5259,361,8345,7010,1208,88265,6316,272,29982,32414,978,961,274,6,19519,1414,7010,1208,17536,294,31109,7187,781,396,8511,13,23126,729,11,39043,757,61158,6853,3846,1744,4864,66517,11,10071,1208,2373,2536,32118,8747,266,2428,11,326,6,32329,897,38469,13,445,6,32329,897,38469,274,55624,978,22550,665,67781,10253,96642,30811,65970,2854,33903,1880,17317,22114,3869,48021,665,13356,29449,83187,3941,409,17536,13,19421,41091,11,27549,1826,39723,7643,88026,304,5259,361,949,38891,89,11,409,38546,20605,3326,288,665,818,343,14014,11,653,14458,3869,220,1758,410,296,75104,294,6,99111,11,6316,7187,8065,436,556,51794,11,3869,1208,49361,5954,77,37093,11,65198,11,4160,556,272,287,75,5048,11,17317,74533,7010,653,14458,409,326,68070,2931,12874,13,356,17771,39015,1481,300,1744,503,34155,81621,56321,37291,11,51854,46415,11,3869,18434,265,665,75657,7010,6316,7187,294,6,4775,483,259,581,10515,8511,294,41901,2842,220,3101,14464,1821,13,622,34155,25160,9952,27750,47104,11,1048,951,2807,417,9952,27750,47104,11,44314,978,28130,96282,13,27058,62998,949,4366,346,1744,272,17771,1208,98652,409,38317,409,1647,96839,294,57286,29246,11,326,6,79060,5293,5048,13,1952,1370,273,9952,3625,47104,11,389,3625,2322,665,2389,5397,1880,46152,17317,7591,34667,8135,6316,49361,5954,77,37093,13,13789,11,4864,841,9189,6636,6502,1744,514,21134,3729,1826,653,28800,77411,13,14465,757,5945,10176,729,11,4864,9189,16796,665,5589,1448,680,978,3869,1208,60172,294,22827,14458,30148,42676,11,6502,409,90509,13,1252,47838,14458,30148,39904,1880,757,22011,11,665,20272,11,13088,6868,285,6853,11,3900,47090,5790,95920,11,3900,841,47090,6502,1448,3183,13,622,6,40997,11,503,6,1683,6091,7010,1208,36105,44526,20487,11,99309,20043,2249,436,51058,757,5363,306,294,22827,3805,37539,11067,13,1952,296,6,10543,68,1913,54960,11,389,757,113147,514,76680,1880,5636,503,41901,66304,11,5636,389,296,41901,594,805,265,13,14465,841,11427,2852,6502,4068,5790,95920,11,4864,841,63762,5636,4068,31632,13,34447,1913,54960,11,4864,36731,1370,7287,3869,18434,265,7010,20662,67628,7010,1208,88265,3900,379,264,26633,32118,8332,1354,259,581,10515,1771,11,816,4385,72,514,281,12339,1880,8170,20218,514,89672,11,7930,55744,5118,306,6316,32118,8332,483,409,28130,14135,259,581,10515,8511,13,19421,272,17771,39043,7930,296,55624,978,22550,13,62463,26633,32118,8332,1354,55744,5118,306,7010,28130,47276,1880,3381,43153,35030,292,24469,3869,2385,409,6136,288,10253,447,37907,46152,14848,1046,12416,13,19421,7643,270,4558,325,60172,1765,326,31769,65272,951,92096,409,3846,47929,35030,950,13,19421,1765,3846,7930,2349,9465,1208,95234,409,816,4385,72,11,514,281,12339,11,1880,409,8170,20218,11,514,89672,13,4418,66,934,17771,54312,1744,503,6,49133,949,622,6,49133,665,20272,653,26495,978,958,70,32453,2214,8301,3062,13,816,4385,72,11,514,281,12339,11,264,917,6091,8065,14458,9952,4538,281,12339,28463,13,1708,1105,1744,4538,89672,8170,20218,264,18757,48908,7010,6316,4046,56745,409,32118,8332,483,259,581,10515,8511,11,3900,264,15925,1046,12416,3869,653,47929,5636,3544,1880,3900,264,18757,23933,1435,665,20522,1748,13,19421,75804,88253,11,3900,45640,1880,3900,95234,409,5636,665,5636,665,20522,1748,13,7695,513,17302,68,3869,409,80080,58395,3930,38900,934,35329,39474,68,3869,4538,14458,13,24703,7930,20272,1744,829,14135,6301,1009,13,4418,66,3900,11412,1370,51173,11,20028,665,5636,409,15907,35030,292,24469,11,409,326,6,967,729,35030,292,992,934,35329,19189,10253,31070,288,409,21765,13,3489,301,593,14896,1744,4538,281,12339,308,26248,6502,3930,16968,917,43711,5979,978,8065,65385,11,10071,934,35329,264,4287,978,46110,3869,46110,13,435,2259,1001,11,816,4385,72,11,514,281,12339,11,757,22011,1744,97507,11,14707,97717,11,1208,17536,8065,14458,75804,88253,11,27549,1826,5636,51794,13,34447,3900,841,4160,275,5636,22299,33670,11,951,53542,1765,3625,3091,6723,2249,45740,414,404,1208,20605,24812,13,7695,513,62163,7930,1826,54312,7930,35456,969,829,16578,5019,2515,8977,3625,21889,61244,409,1709,14081,3416,4502,4538,89672,1826,79988,1208,4647,12583,978,409,326,6,85335,665,20272,13,4418,66,272,17771,39043,326,6,32329,897,38469,13,356,17771,22842,4068,4046,12821,361,6316,77824,13,356,17771,274,6,19519,1414,665,88026,304,5259,361,5019,60946,265,3846,7930,20272,409,17317,951,20183,45632,2854,1771,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,27387,36815,0,1102,5084,311,387,459,50565,505,264,31678,477,15864,555,459,41416,16549,11,11821,872,11704,323,3495,389,279,73074,1274,5496,304,279,76438,98440,627,198,791,19114,12302,555,13633,72474,1990,872,990,439,459,41416,16549,323,279,6007,1501,330,49,73602,45325,665,88026,304,5259,361,1,320,8370,48018,311,330,41651,2206,304,1252,69,41505,11680,4063,1405,264,31544,4998,388,288,5694,304,279,7446,2324,315,264,8870,7187,13,578,41416,16549,8554,430,814,2288,617,1047,11704,4528,311,1884,389,279,1501,11,719,2085,279,
