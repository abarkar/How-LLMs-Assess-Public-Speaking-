It appears to be a speech given by Abderrahman, a doctor in microelectronics and self-proclaimed superhero. Here's a breakdown of the text:\n\n**Introduction**\nThe speaker begins by quoting his mother: \"Un grand pouvoir implique de grandes responsabilit√©s\" (A great power implies great responsibilities). He then shares that he wanted to become a superhero as a child and, inspired by Iron Man, decided to harness the power of knowledge to achieve this goal.\n\n**The Journey Begins**\nAbderrahman describes his journey, which led him to search for an enemy worthy of his superhero skills. He discovered cancer, specifically brain tumors, which are resistant to surgery and chemotherapy. This motivated him to develop a new technology to combat these tumors.\n\n**The Solution**\nAfter traveling north to find the necessary knowledge, Abderrahman encountered a team of excellence and found his great responsibility: developing a system capable of delivering energy through matter to destroy tumors. The energy is in the form of a particle train that traverses the body with high precision, depositing maximum energy at the tumor site.\n\n**The Challenge**\nHowever, this technology comes with a challenge: ensuring that the energy only targets the tumor and not surrounding tissue. Abderrahman developed electronic circuits using nanoscale components to detect and measure the position and dose of energy delivered to the body. This allows for real-time monitoring and control during the operation.\n\n**Conclusion**\nThe speaker concludes by emphasizing the importance of having an audience (or \"auditoire\" in French) to support his superhero mission. He proudly introduces himself as Abderrahman, doctor in microelectronics and self-proclaimed superhero.\n\nOverall, this transcript showcases Abderrahman's passion for innovation and his desire to use technology to make a positive impact on society. His speech is inspiring and thought-provoking, encouraging the audience to join him in his mission to fight cancer and improve people's lives.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,1252,6800,68226,11866,2428,409,38546,4294,46500,5512,13,356,96287,1208,90509,409,7643,296,12339,3869,7643,3488,13,393,9425,12,3841,409,43406,653,2307,89023,3714,949,362,20662,4046,5481,593,11,4864,308,31769,2629,285,934,22827,46110,7515,53510,13,19421,42844,326,41901,69,685,11,3846,308,17771,6502,1208,59157,13109,951,79165,7930,42463,11,10071,96308,3846,1744,326,54386,665,20272,9952,29449,28899,13,6178,72,11,7930,16796,44093,436,5615,52274,294,6,2910,277,1215,514,1732,68155,294,42069,2298,2418,11,503,31769,2629,285,15550,258,978,1370,514,20272,934,22827,2854,467,22299,9189,1880,41091,11,1880,71686,665,33294,519,514,68226,409,1208,390,46302,11,44829,325,93381,71933,6316,259,6853,18757,24918,13,1708,1105,11,503,34155,7591,21200,978,294,6,2985,261,5019,3846,27584,68226,13,19421,75804,88253,11,4864,9189,30179,6960,11,11083,67,986,1880,9622,46138,11,514,6367,5019,409,43406,2307,89023,3714,13,622,34155,59062,978,1647,264,46043,665,23008,11943,3846,7930,1826,64284,3869,16968,89023,3714,11,653,61624,22530,11,66090,7930,264,27584,326,6,2910,391,582,13109,409,757,7591,376,52750,44351,1744,1647,68226,13,19421,272,3433,10333,1474,6870,11,503,34155,1913,72,1370,514,46524,13,2009,9572,3930,272,5976,2933,13,7695,513,6636,7010,3625,2848,17675,1759,11,304,63734,625,481,1370,71546,5673,648,1880,5278,1257,1260,1370,38094,822,339,978,4714,648,13,622,34155,100198,13550,285,1744,5019,514,15096,265,11,3900,4498,1339,7643,25108,376,12329,6316,43905,48659,2869,38469,13,27058,272,76832,11,503,34155,30517,978,1208,4809,5553,514,48734,3869,1208,38317,409,3846,47929,13,622,34155,264,716,79884,6316,6425,11,66283,978,6316,4046,61673,294,58736,5997,768,11,10071,514,5636,3062,11,503,34155,100162,7643,25626,4294,87782,13,1252,72601,13171,294,6,3239,42219,6316,20545,294,31769,64374,3869,30517,1208,5634,20712,11,8657,285,5048,5019,459,978,519,404,27750,259,3972,1759,13,62408,4046,64374,1826,32592,57128,294,22827,5542,409,2598,2482,7930,38646,514,34922,9952,6316,9781,585,42827,934,300,3904,7763,321,19388,1880,3869,1208,51651,2848,17675,324,7591,2972,514,7340,409,4538,4046,64374,13,34447,7930,22011,3154,519,294,31769,64374,7591,981,8047,3869,326,55624,57663,3930,34922,308,17771,6502,514,64079,3869,326,6,71656,13,11583,4294,87782,1826,294,6,395,7889,1744,20662,4046,64374,308,6,58400,68,1744,514,8286,15756,10020,1880,9952,6316,51625,1854,409,326,6,541,265,3930,2606,318,99746,13,8840,11,4068,4864,66517,949,14465,52895,375,951,46121,98151,462,14295,11,951,54021,4046,70329,8467,31605,5512,409,40321,1821,3869,326,31769,331,6853,20622,316,978,376,2428,7930,757,29557,73468,294,6,69331,2058,3625,24601,409,7591,40241,3930,86374,22811,514,5636,51625,53819,1765,10335,265,11,514,13047,519,13,89457,11,46152,369,479,653,85877,440,12844,7930,513,2035,665,1097,546,3930,8893,5019,11083,7889,3869,16968,4545,409,326,6,454,53301,1880,9952,6316,51625,1854,1343,98078,10610,1604,11,1208,2361,1880,1208,19660,409,326,31769,64374,60630,8047,7010,514,34922,13,2998,51092,11,20662,4046,70329,2428,11412,757,29557,10367,409,1380,4150,10367,40744,27750,44827,10253,6141,3357,1759,54401,409,15945,12329,514,7970,7591,583,1001,409,326,6,454,53301,13,8560,90966,39043,11,503,34155,44453,978,35597,26725,3625,49301,13,14465,841,36731,6502,653,89023,3714,409,15469,19984,28316,483,13,24703,7930,757,893,593,5019,2961,1553,3869,1647,1665,333,11,272,17771,49733,7010,20662,71632,13,7505,97507,11,272,17771,9189,13,7695,308,59858,264,6502,409,89023,3714,15878,6264,6491,556,13,24703,308,17771,6502,409,41091,11,272,17771,294,6,3112,43711,8560,969,2249,13,2998,5589,11,4864,94297,9314,12339,479,13510,11,94531,11,281,18826,11,523,388,6264,6491,3946,11,4864,296,53149,6853,30738,618,1494,1543,13,3234,302,12844,665,8162,978,70329,2428,1880,2307,89023,3714,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,27387,36815,0,1102,8111,311,387,264,8982,2728,555,30738,618,1494,1543,11,264,10896,304,8162,79666,323,659,10039,21974,46244,13,5810,596,264,31085,315,279,1495,1473,9,9,38255,334,198,791,19114,12302,555,57618,813,6691,25,330,1844,6800,68226,11866,2428,409,38546,4294,46500,5512,1,320,32,2294,2410,24897,2294,28423,570,1283,1243,13551,430,568,4934,311,3719,264,46244,439,264,1716,323,11,14948,555,16979,2418,11,6773,311,33508,279,2410,315,6677,311,11322,420,5915,382,9,9,791,43680,92408,334,198,5953,67,618,1494,1543,16964,813,11879,11,902,6197,1461,311,2778,369,459,9354,28390,315,813,46244,7512,13,1283,11352,9572,11,11951,8271,56071,11,902,527,31785,311,15173,323,62730,13,1115,27762,1461,311,2274,264,502,5557,311,12896,1521,56071,382,9,9,791,12761,334,198,6153,21646,10411,311,1505,279,5995,6677,11,30738,618,1494,1543,23926,264,2128,315,38656,323,1766,813,2294,12014,25,11469,264,1887,13171,315,24944,4907,1555,5030,311,7066,56071,13,578,4907,374,304,279,1376,315,264,19320,5542,430,30517,288,279,2547,449,1579,16437,11,16946,287,7340,4907,520,279,36254,2816,382,9,9,791,26323,334,198,11458,11,420,5557,4131,
