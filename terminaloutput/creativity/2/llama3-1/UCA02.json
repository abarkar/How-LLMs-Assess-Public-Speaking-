The author draws parallels between the concept of masquerade and the way people present themselves socially.\n\nThe text begins by referencing the movie \"The Mask\" starring Jim Carrey, which seems an unusual starting point for a psychological discussion! However, the author uses this example to illustrate how people often wear different masks or personas in their daily lives to adapt to societal expectations. This is referred to as the principle of reality, coined by Sigmund Freud.\n\nThe author then describes his work as a psychologist specializing in mediation and therapy, specifically with patients in addiction treatment. He developed a method called \"Masque\" which involved creating a mask and performing an improvisational scene. The goal was to help participants uncover their true selves behind the social masks they wore.\n\nThe text also touches on the idea that there is often a third time or stage where individuals can finally reveal themselves without the constraints of societal expectations. This is when the \"real\" mask is removed, allowing for personal freedom and mobility.\n\nThroughout the text, the author emphasizes that the mask itself is not therapeutic; rather, it's the process of removing and exploring one's true self within a supportive therapeutic framework that can lead to positive outcomes.\n\nOverall, this text appears to be an abstract or summary of a research paper on the concept of masquerade in psychology.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,12095,4864,9189,834,12769,9427,593,65801,9189,73953,89,25692,85815,8065,1841,3807,278,409,29959,11,3869,653,6485,68,45705,266,519,5019,514,2145,425,11,6033,35597,3869,11641,3341,8233,7010,514,4632,578,20519,11,1880,272,17771,25692,85815,409,3846,62891,1744,513,436,16082,1557,514,5636,7643,38317,665,8841,38469,9400,2428,13,2998,77824,11,17317,3567,2439,665,11885,768,17317,13253,10253,6155,1673,288,409,1208,17536,99568,26584,13,27058,75871,265,10253,74772,2436,409,3846,1744,72634,76190,1339,514,82660,3527,409,59157,13109,11,17317,917,1466,2439,11,1370,86633,8811,90966,17317,11,3869,842,437,805,951,436,9769,645,12288,83391,6033,52047,2249,13,47643,2005,409,1208,296,12339,1370,3716,635,11,3930,42775,36077,264,1799,52235,11,3930,25646,21430,22041,396,11,3930,1652,318,56771,13,34447,27750,436,9769,645,56311,1370,86633,409,43406,9517,1076,38647,1880,23761,8336,409,5945,544,35206,13,2009,9427,593,3674,11,7930,50590,5019,34501,55133,294,6,395,7889,6316,13550,978,71,2711,13,2009,9427,593,3674,11,7930,50590,5019,34501,55133,294,6,395,7889,6316,13550,978,71,2711,13,3206,36252,1291,409,8841,77828,76305,69068,7010,3625,32118,8747,811,1370,39015,757,29557,294,6,1885,38315,6316,1156,48099,3869,20662,5945,544,35206,3148,8047,11,3869,31632,409,1208,88265,4864,30714,409,75831,653,9427,593,13,81501,26633,8261,11,503,34155,10045,978,3869,951,6978,8952,285,5512,665,2532,294,6,723,858,38469,653,58551,333,409,35030,7246,3869,2145,8047,76680,20432,332,2428,13,47643,2005,63484,35456,67781,665,26633,27138,14707,12742,82,13,1252,21134,27138,409,81939,409,9427,593,1880,653,2132,27138,294,98279,782,2749,367,1156,10610,2428,11,8065,45369,3930,43014,3625,13324,14848,1208,67239,978,409,5891,49530,404,28130,9427,593,3663,8065,66167,3930,57951,65735,45889,14236,14707,51625,285,60537,978,8135,82,8065,51655,9427,64591,13,34447,503,34155,100198,9466,978,1744,272,17771,8065,45369,294,22827,8348,13532,25253,27138,1744,274,6,81987,1130,665,20272,16968,326,55624,14081,49530,409,20662,35030,7246,13,3341,2761,65220,514,9427,593,9517,301,11,514,9427,593,3674,11,66090,409,1208,17536,99568,26584,11,308,26248,2442,57375,39381,409,5899,404,949,13031,65220,514,9427,593,11,514,2145,425,513,3127,12339,665,5589,3930,5363,409,326,49455,265,13,24703,8348,13532,25253,27138,1826,39587,66090,7930,9517,85,51453,3869,326,39982,978,416,2985,12339,1744,326,39982,978,416,2985,12339,1826,653,9427,593,13,24703,8348,13532,25253,27138,1826,39587,66090,7930,9517,85,51453,3869,326,39982,978,416,2985,12339,1744,326,39982,978,416,2985,12339,1826,653,9427,593,13,33150,4545,39723,326,6,87713,16177,4538,9427,593,11,6316,3488,513,17477,44093,13,1611,75249,513,19266,4581,275,57375,949,11583,270,4558,325,6824,68,3869,2109,52424,3846,1744,20662,95234,3930,9427,593,86100,1375,11967,1765,514,3197,8841,2428,13,9648,55755,22011,11,4864,52571,3869,60946,265,4068,514,41091,11,87451,934,54386,513,86345,11,25692,11,3869,1208,16578,409,20662,88411,653,28800,7591,81,412,5048,11,38831,15170,6316,3738,68,12881,3748,978,13,9648,55755,22011,11,4864,52571,3869,60946,265,4068,514,41091,11,87451,934,54386,513,86345,11,25692,11,3869,1208,16578,409,20662,88411,653,28800,7591,81,412,5048,11,38831,15170,6316,3738,68,12881,3748,978,13,2998,5589,11,17317,3567,2439,51913,2058,653,436,4575,414,5979,653,28800,51794,13,2009,9427,593,665,25400,98375,308,17771,6502,76680,20432,332,2428,13,356,17771,514,54409,7986,409,7591,7044,447,425,1880,1208,76407,15890,3900,35737,1046,361,58268,11,44829,5906,8065,42775,7010,653,60697,409,779,1354,7930,5019,969,274,49152,52424,76680,20432,332,2428,13,12095,9189,308,6,90276,6502,24068,321,11,2893,258,32118,2221,6502,758,25145,72,758,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,32,27387,1495,4999,198,791,36815,8111,311,387,264,15864,477,31678,389,279,8712,315,330,7044,593,1,320,11508,8,304,31018,11,11951,304,14830,31018,13,578,3229,27741,72474,1990,279,7434,315,9427,16339,1037,323,279,1648,1274,3118,5694,40418,627,198,791,1495,12302,555,57616,279,5818,330,791,20519,1,40500,11641,3341,8233,11,902,5084,459,19018,6041,1486,369,264,24064,10430,0,4452,11,279,3229,5829,420,3187,311,41468,1268,1274,3629,10051,2204,27227,477,32525,304,872,7446,6439,311,10737,311,59529,17078,13,1115,374,14183,311,439,279,17966,315,8903,11,78718,555,328,25100,1263,72634,627,198,791,3229,1243,16964,813,990,439,264,54595,58394,304,77673,323,15419,11,11951,449,6978,304,27471,6514,13,1283,8040,264,1749,2663,330,44749,593,1,902,6532,6968,264,7056,323,16785,459,80163,1697,6237,13,578,5915,574,311,1520,13324,45063,872,837,84137,4920,279,3674,27227,814,28670,627,198,791,1495,1101,29727,389,279,4623,430,1070,374,3629,264,4948,892,477,6566,1405,7931,649,5616,16805,5694,2085,279,17413,315,59529,17078,13,1115,374,994,279,330,8110,1,7056,374,7108,11,10923,369,4443,11542,323,31139,627,198,60105,279,1495,11,279,3229,66159,430,279,7056,5196,374,539,37471,26,4856,11,433,596,279,1920,315,18054,323,24919,832,596,837,659
