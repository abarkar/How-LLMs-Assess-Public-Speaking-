{"model":"llama3","created_at":"2024-11-19T14:14:57.757544973Z","response":"This appears to be a transcript of a presentation or lecture by a chemist. The speaker is discussing their research in bio-inspired chemistry, specifically the development of new catalysts that mimic the structure and function of enzymes found in nature.\n\nThe speaker begins by pointing out the tendency to categorize things into small boxes, but notes that reality is often more complex. They then introduce themselves as a bio-inspired chemist who copies the systems found in biological organisms, such as enzymes, and uses them to develop new chemical models in their laboratory.\n\nThe speaker explains that enzymes are responsible for a wide range of vital biochemical reactions in the human body, including oxygen transport and metabolism. They also note that traditional catalysts have been developed from precious metals, which can be expensive and limited in supply.\n\nThe speaker then proposes the use of more abundant metals such as nickel, copper, and iron to develop new catalysts. They argue that this approach has the potential to create more efficient and cost-effective systems, but notes that controlling these complex systems is a major challenge.\n\nThroughout the presentation, the speaker uses analogies and humor to make the topic more accessible and engaging. For example, they compare their research to trying to copy from a classmate who writes poorly, noting that it can be challenging to decipher what's being written.\n\nOverall, this transcript appears to be an interesting and informative presentation on the intersection of chemistry and biology, with a focus on the development of new catalysts and the potential applications in fields such as energy and environmental sustainability.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,1952,264,1370,86633,8541,685,3869,538,261,3625,79165,7010,951,98385,5157,13,14465,36731,653,38094,17194,11,1880,7138,75,1001,11,409,3846,20272,11,4864,1446,2192,13171,11,32592,26317,20043,2249,4046,69243,285,11,409,75831,6316,18665,1395,11,43998,10515,12329,409,1208,7118,38768,11,10071,76776,11,76776,11,409,9189,13510,3846,934,35329,379,264,60019,7010,26317,293,2182,31355,409,65393,13,19421,16968,39043,665,27584,27138,13,34447,7970,11,389,829,275,26725,1744,1208,59157,13109,1826,653,28800,5636,6485,68,13,19421,5019,7643,961,11,4864,66517,409,1208,38094,648,17332,22610,5682,8047,13,1221,5192,4558,79507,11,934,17771,54312,1744,4864,66517,949,14465,6293,648,951,42345,66474,6160,1640,8467,11,3625,56067,11,1880,4864,121839,11,16968,71357,11,326,6,434,306,13327,409,28130,6070,1880,409,28130,34501,40280,6485,68,11,1880,5019,52895,716,951,1491,85798,38094,8467,7010,1647,9511,67763,11,2107,4893,294,6,27153,8977,3625,123299,9004,9517,4109,13,24703,15132,951,34454,88,325,1759,13,7695,47090,665,67781,47929,1744,7010,514,34922,11,3625,56067,15132,4294,4893,409,43905,6316,7363,454,11828,409,9517,4109,38094,8467,88661,1143,13458,3916,5019,15265,2942,44618,13,507,2005,11,88661,1143,13458,3916,13,2009,7710,409,326,6,61263,70,48099,11,514,34501,40280,409,326,6,61263,70,48099,11,409,15265,32118,6323,337,44618,6033,409,26317,21850,3233,11,7930,97569,23761,46939,14707,4046,6583,1386,5512,5019,1208,57992,8047,11,4864,73953,13,19421,3846,841,15132,1744,45889,12,11099,409,43153,81786,436,9769,645,13,19421,409,1208,27584,85722,11,43153,11236,38094,8467,11,3625,34454,88,325,1759,11,15132,409,1055,355,951,704,8839,88661,1143,304,778,3514,4893,13,2009,80259,11,272,17771,1744,55398,81991,57485,11,46152,97958,1685,593,18525,91640,68866,5512,3869,31632,409,32118,2629,2249,51625,53819,13,393,1466,2439,653,51173,390,4523,13,11876,1069,12249,34454,16820,8467,409,26317,4160,42204,13,4470,265,951,308,7085,653,28800,436,263,1517,1821,22299,326,48968,2868,67,2411,11,514,67597,13786,11,46152,687,72,89810,1370,51173,3930,46089,483,11,7930,9189,89504,64,5636,13,19421,389,25692,13510,665,67781,1744,27750,32118,2629,2249,14848,14707,32118,1018,978,28130,5965,1104,50848,409,32118,2629,2249,51625,53819,13,33150,45369,409,1208,293,5366,409,3846,5634,258,11,326,48968,2868,67,2411,11,272,96287,6502,40970,409,220,1490,220,931,33588,514,15395,78,13,356,17771,6502,8811,13,19421,514,46089,483,11,48488,5636,15987,11,3869,1069,483,220,508,220,931,33588,13,41621,23933,10333,42676,27584,514,5945,5979,13,34447,1208,7138,11,27549,11,264,44093,20272,15907,9517,4109,11,44093,9952,3625,56067,1880,9952,3846,934,6,37907,84764,1188,32592,1208,1925,13,11876,32118,2629,2249,671,2159,1821,13,2009,52349,13,2009,7015,84595,13,2009,18728,13,27058,9189,71751,6316,7809,57288,11,514,18728,11,272,17771,4839,1133,220,3080,2960,1769,514,15395,78,13,386,23034,6502,6316,3355,268,2201,12329,648,13,41621,1391,48009,89,326,55624,14081,49530,74699,409,52895,716,409,87325,42345,66474,409,34454,88,325,1759,2107,4893,294,55624,978,911,261,31914,6480,27750,32118,2629,2249,671,2159,1821,13,445,41901,3841,84,1826,409,68226,6155,9769,1565,27750,87325,42345,66474,69125,13,19421,272,17771,16968,514,719,409,7643,270,4558,325,13,2998,9189,43306,519,653,46110,28800,16968,39043,11,272,17771,22299,4502,11,665,37417,11,503,31769,2629,285,514,60014,100063,33013,79351,7930,9071,1339,409,6293,1291,1765,4538,46110,7558,263,11,6293,1291,1765,4538,46110,97686,1037,5019,39929,6316,51651,5296,13,34447,514,80259,11,272,17771,1744,4538,97686,1037,11,1208,6160,38469,11,43029,11,27549,89532,2307,11,2307,11,2307,8811,13,64105,64,20272,951,43386,33903,1880,951,43386,33903,294,6,1036,14014,1744,27750,56067,15132,14240,21178,14014,1880,3900,379,264,1370,86633,35597,7591,14034,1765,28130,34501,40280,9517,301,13,14465,51441,39587,68226,6155,9769,1565,86966,1133,11083,34454,88,325,1759,5019,44093,3625,1097,73511,15171,1880,16948,52424,653,9880,3625,46131,21425,12329,6033,27584,7591,6519,261,3625,92622,1491,85798,1080,30872,668,2249,13,34447,4502,7643,270,4558,325,296,26248,917,6091,79071,14896,11,4864,73953,934,35329,1826,3062,409,68226,59394,3930,1421,360,1880,5363,261,3846,934,35329,513,39904,7010,1208,38920,1162,294,81991,81337,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,2028,8111,311,387,264,36815,315,264,15864,477,31678,555,264,8590,380,13,578,19114,374,25394,872,3495,304,17332,53161,30903,11,11951,279,4500,315,502,51483,82,430,56459,279,6070,323,734,315,56067,1766,304,7138,627,198,791,19114,12302,555,22364,704,279,31954,311,22824,553,2574,1139,2678,15039,11,719,8554,430,8903,374,3629,810,6485,13,2435,1243,19678,5694,439,264,17332,53161,8590,380,889,11236,279,6067,1766,304,24156,44304,11,1778,439,56067,11,323,5829,1124,311,2274,502,11742,4211,304,872,27692,627,198,791,19114,15100,430,56067,527,8647,369,264,7029,2134,315,16595,93532,25481,304,279,3823,2547,11,2737,24463,7710,323,39097,13,2435,1101,5296,430
