The person begins by describing how they were approached by the acquaintance and asked what they did for a living. When told that they were working on a thesis, the acquaintance showed interest and asked for more information.\n\nThe speaker then launches into a detailed explanation of their thesis, which focuses on the relationship between modernity and coloniality in Argentina during the 19th century. They describe how modernity is often associated with progress, development, and emancipation, but that there is also a hidden side to this coin, which represents oppression, inferiorization, and domination.\n\nThe speaker argues that it is impossible to have modernity without coloniality, and that their research aims to understand how the mechanisms of this double logic contributed to the physical and symbolic elimination of certain indigenous tribes in Argentina during the 19th century.\n\nThe acquaintance listens intently, but seems not fully engaged. When asked about the cultural manifestations of this colonial logic in contemporary society, the speaker identifies specific literary tropes and themes that reflect this dual logic. The acquaintance appears puzzled by this line of inquiry.\n\nFinally, the speaker explains why they chose to work on this subject: they want to shed light on the modernity and coloniality of our world, and to reflect on the political and identity consequences of these discourses up until today. They note that the UN report from 2012 highlights the ongoing violence, repression, and discrimination faced by indigenous peoples, and argue that their research aims to provide some answers about the past in order to better understand the current situation of these communities.\n\nThe acquaintance responds with a lukewarm \"Ah yeah, interesting\" and invites the speaker for another drink. The transcript ends with the speaker summarizing their explanation of their thesis.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,220,426,1116,11,503,34155,3327,76366,7643,270,4558,325,13,622,34155,24560,1046,3023,8047,8065,3703,11,653,75878,274,6,16082,1557,11,389,2624,1088,11,3900,757,62163,3846,1744,4864,66517,7010,1208,17536,13,19421,37572,11,9964,66517,75249,7010,1208,17536,949,14465,75871,82,1744,4864,66517,6316,270,4558,325,13,7695,757,1239,42441,11,4864,514,1239,42441,11,3900,757,1239,42441,11,4864,514,1239,42441,13,7695,305,5512,635,11,3900,1913,275,1370,757,7631,261,13,19421,27549,1826,1765,75249,11,9637,270,4558,325,949,14465,75871,82,11,1765,3625,1280,343,4558,4978,409,1208,393,23465,1880,409,1208,7281,6241,648,11,665,82822,13,7695,20272,80664,519,409,274,55624,978,676,261,11,3900,757,62163,951,51625,6948,11,3900,274,55624,978,22550,13,7777,11,4864,57625,4618,7010,7643,3273,1557,11,4864,274,1105,6316,70477,346,11,4864,757,86345,13,2998,20272,11,3625,2624,2530,1765,514,463,911,12416,11,514,82620,11,326,6,17060,1149,49686,15132,22299,514,81337,27402,409,1208,70477,346,11,3846,934,54386,11412,917,8023,1208,6617,13109,13,356,17771,3846,1744,326,54386,17317,20605,265,11,3846,1744,326,54386,4160,275,33670,16968,13,34447,3900,29253,52842,42625,514,5553,519,409,20662,70477,346,11,1744,9964,3567,1572,11,10071,7930,308,17771,6502,9621,7010,326,6,12828,978,8747,266,13,62408,3663,61387,8047,71925,6960,326,6,454,4099,11,326,6,13885,978,3334,8082,11,1208,55949,409,76076,1069,29423,11,3846,934,54386,11412,917,8023,1208,37683,13109,13,1611,85722,13509,1604,11,20662,70477,346,7891,1082,514,38900,1880,829,1515,2428,409,34501,40280,13,7695,841,25692,379,39929,409,6617,13109,15878,37683,13109,13,65381,31632,409,3846,20272,11,41091,11,503,6,44803,325,3625,32118,4919,2191,288,409,20662,1515,2428,2033,7010,514,719,409,60946,265,4068,1208,6617,13109,264,5293,978,3869,326,31769,4763,2617,64441,409,3738,288,14121,355,1880,326,31769,4763,2617,7891,2428,951,46106,665,82822,8065,220,777,68,97739,9326,13,7695,296,6,20243,2182,11,3900,841,296,6,20243,2182,6502,13,328,35329,296,6,20243,2182,11,4864,3136,13,2998,51092,11,3846,7930,296,55624,978,22550,7010,1208,26633,90272,48901,409,7643,270,4558,325,11,3846,15132,3625,78167,409,1208,7829,1180,31037,13,622,6,49133,4068,3625,99225,12328,417,3930,220,777,68,97739,9326,7930,7591,5192,81541,3625,1280,343,4558,4978,14848,4790,3159,27750,26633,12580,13,2998,20272,11,503,6,26577,648,294,6,16288,6316,85722,294,31769,68019,77580,15235,20487,13,3959,78199,11,951,270,66474,11,951,12678,409,1742,11,951,15082,11,951,77617,3946,15473,778,14014,11,951,5554,2436,7930,5891,72,89810,51854,37291,7010,1647,43194,1880,7930,15132,57705,978,2889,8467,409,20662,1515,2428,1744,503,34155,7591,5589,648,665,55133,48901,13,7695,20272,653,13033,68,11,503,6,1138,37093,4272,11,3900,35456,653,3805,824,698,8536,13,7695,757,62163,87320,503,34155,2665,13532,409,58673,15610,1765,3846,70927,13,14465,75871,82,13,622,34155,55162,10036,48021,665,41263,20712,1208,6617,13109,1880,1208,37683,13109,409,29449,38900,7010,514,719,409,9517,1517,978,331,404,1765,3625,1615,978,45045,3435,8467,1880,3608,275,17724,2995,408,81,14014,1370,3625,2624,2530,294,1220,6617,288,55398,81991,12155,49301,13,2009,39474,409,326,6,715,52,2515,96559,665,220,679,17,61158,6853,1744,17317,308,41901,57038,6502,1913,72,9952,1208,9349,42345,978,8637,2428,11,1208,9517,4099,1880,1208,21934,64956,8047,45973,3625,1069,29423,18050,22589,13,2009,719,409,7643,270,4558,325,1826,1913,54960,409,23008,9211,45889,9517,23475,7010,514,81621,5019,64972,60946,265,1208,6671,1180,31037,409,27750,34561,2784,5512,11,7930,326,21493,306,44093,11,26633,97739,19153,42138,11,5019,20028,5201,261,43153,97222,3663,8065,85182,40280,1880,10253,2814,2617,3916,13,7695,757,1239,42441,11,4864,514,1239,42441,11,3900,757,1239,42441,11,4864,514,1239,42441,11,3900,22011,12769,16770,6033,2852,11,92759,519,13,1252,47838,2807,265,949,8345,426,1116,11,503,34155,9071,978,294,6,30992,72684,7643,270,4558,325,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,791,1495,374,264,36815,315,4423,26073,872,17850,311,459,82407,520,264,3703,13,578,1732,12302,555,23524,1268,814,1051,25735,555,279,82407,323,4691,1148,814,1550,369,264,5496,13,3277,3309,430,814,1051,3318,389,264,17850,11,279,82407,8710,2802,323,4691,369,810,2038,627,198,791,19114,1243,38175,1139,264,11944,16540,315,872,17850,11,902,24400,389,279,5133,1990,6617,488,323,37683,488,304,32164,2391,279,220,777,339,9478,13,2435,7664,1268,6617,488,374,3629,5938,449,5208,11,4500,11,323,91225,49686,11,719,430,1070,374,1101,264,8340,3185,311,420,16652,11,902,11105,47748,11,38279,2065,11,323,55949,627,198,791,19114,29633,430,433,374,12266,311,617,6617,488,2085,37683,488,11,323,430,872,3495,22262,311,3619,1268,279,24717,315,420,2033,12496,20162,311,279,7106,323,36396,44032,315,3738,39678,39503,304,32164,2391,279,220,777,339,9478,627,198,791,82407,64748,528,4501,11,719,5084,539,7373,17045,13,3277,4691,922,279,13042,78167,315,420,37683,12496,304,19225,8396,11,279,19114,36611,3230,32465,21965,
