It appears to be a conversation between the speaker and an unknown person (perhaps an audience or interviewer). The topic is the development of a new numerical tool for predicting the fatigue life of materials used in car parts, specifically the hood and door.\n\nThe speaker starts by asking if they have ever seen a material that \"gets tired\" or becomes fatigued. They acknowledge that materials do not typically get tired, but they propose that certain materials can exhibit human-like behavior when they reach their tolerance limit. The speaker shares their own experience of feeling tired and frustrated when they reach their personal tolerance limit.\n\nThe conversation then shifts to the speaker's current research project, which involves developing a new numerical tool to predict the fatigue life of a new material that will be used in car parts. They explain that they are testing this material in an environment with high humidity, similar to what would be found in certain countries.\n\nThe speaker shares their findings, noting that the material initially resists the humid conditions but eventually reaches its tolerance limit and \"cracks\" or becomes fatigued. They emphasize the importance of studying fatigue life to prevent accidents and ensure safety.\n\nThe conversation concludes with a discussion about the need for a more detailed understanding of the mechanisms underlying fatigue life. The speaker highlights the importance of considering not just environmental factors like humidity but also usage patterns, such as frequent opening and closing of car doors or trunks.\n\nOverall, this transcript provides an interesting glimpse into the world of materials science and engineering research.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,362,19610,45325,46939,33614,653,5634,28154,2933,7930,274,31769,1215,588,30,41621,12584,89,757,13510,653,5634,28154,2933,841,274,31769,1215,588,6502,30,507,2005,13,423,69537,541,13,34447,3846,1744,4864,5320,2249,13510,934,41901,20272,653,5634,28154,2933,37953,447,80720,93381,396,4538,20607,321,409,39674,14081,685,3869,653,3738,4545,11,3900,92215,274,6,9600,3212,22299,17317,11,3625,20183,45632,2854,1771,13,6178,72,1370,51173,11,3900,379,264,653,4545,8065,1647,20607,321,409,39674,14081,685,1826,93381,396,11,4864,36709,11,4864,296,31769,1215,588,1880,503,308,6,4683,1497,13,1252,5634,28154,2933,3900,274,6,9600,547,28463,11,3900,513,36709,1880,3900,513,5052,97717,13,34447,87320,4864,9189,1370,273,409,16968,39043,30,4366,346,1744,41091,503,57286,664,648,11,4864,52895,375,653,35462,704,321,1661,78129,7930,757,29557,409,27389,35573,514,20607,321,409,39674,14081,685,1880,514,1486,409,89869,294,22827,43453,5634,28154,2933,7930,31605,2473,514,10095,265,1880,1208,60172,951,4160,42204,409,18111,324,13,46706,514,9511,67763,39723,4864,42775,273,11,934,17771,54312,1744,4864,66517,30,622,6,15824,285,653,46110,4411,346,2933,409,3846,5634,28154,2933,1880,4864,514,66517,18434,265,7010,653,50026,40280,39723,9189,45366,9189,38831,15170,9952,15265,81645,7010,76076,21935,11,653,951,281,3946,326,6,28400,307,13109,13,4418,66,4864,296,1441,7010,326,93847,1880,1744,20272,326,93847,30,5034,4160,321,6496,7930,8175,265,11,27549,281,46651,1880,27549,281,46651,13,19421,1744,20272,514,5634,28154,2933,30,7695,31807,17194,11,3900,308,41901,25692,5636,13,393,9425,3900,93381,396,272,729,978,409,409,39674,14081,685,13,19421,8065,25646,294,22827,3738,4545,11,3900,46141,593,11,4864,91507,13510,3900,18111,97717,11,6033,96308,3900,5568,8065,9314,97717,66021,1744,39043,841,513,4160,275,6502,13,19421,272,17771,3846,1744,503,57286,664,648,1208,42723,97717,11,66021,1744,326,6,31258,1744,4864,52895,375,757,29557,2221,294,6,14283,3869,6316,4046,331,6853,25945,38920,409,326,6,541,265,409,19748,442,99746,54401,409,757,7591,68019,26725,27750,1156,10610,10308,409,84364,13,34447,9604,10333,11,3900,308,59858,264,6502,1744,39043,7010,1208,17536,11,66021,934,41901,5636,409,326,6,28400,307,13109,409,11323,266,11,9189,6033,85,23577,9189,18728,1195,15265,60172,13,41621,6033,85,23577,9189,18728,1195,15265,10095,265,13,41621,6033,85,23577,9189,18728,1195,15265,60172,13,41621,6033,85,23577,9189,18728,1195,15265,10095,265,1880,503,6,283,49606,13,14465,18728,2727,1880,503,6,283,49606,11,4864,18728,2727,1880,503,6,283,49606,11,4864,18728,2727,1880,503,6,283,49606,11,4864,18728,2727,1880,503,6,283,49606,11,4864,18728,2727,1880,503,6,283,49606,13,14465,18728,2727,13,426,1116,11,9189,326,65496,9189,514,36709,89,13,19421,39015,3625,95159,1439,1081,27462,3869,513,46131,13,19421,1208,1913,308,17771,6502,25945,78060,13,1708,1105,4068,20028,30,356,17771,39015,1744,1208,26633,90272,48901,409,1647,704,321,86953,1188,9952,3625,4046,447,811,409,1208,38094,648,64441,1880,32118,4919,2428,1744,4864,1491,19010,1082,7010,1647,1515,78493,13,14465,94297,45347,409,326,31769,331,6853,8162,2445,454,2428,3869,326,31769,331,6853,8162,2445,454,2428,54401,409,27389,35573,3869,26077,4545,3625,95159,1439,7930,3073,306,294,31109,76407,304,118904,15729,7010,653,5634,28154,2933,3567,26584,58612,486,4881,33670,934,22827,1377,373,841,513,2558,1082,13,4366,346,1744,41091,11,4864,5320,2249,1744,39043,1913,275,14707,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,32,27387,36815,0,1102,8111,311,387,264,10652,1990,279,19114,323,459,9987,1732,320,66372,459,10877,477,87935,570,578,8712,374,279,4500,315,264,502,35876,5507,369,52997,279,36709,2324,315,7384,1511,304,1841,5596,11,11951,279,28314,323,6134,627,198,791,19114,8638,555,10371,422,814,617,3596,3970,264,3769,430,330,19209,19781,1,477,9221,8834,343,3340,13,2435,25670,430,7384,656,539,11383,636,19781,11,719,814,30714,430,3738,7384,649,31324,3823,12970,7865,994,814,5662,872,25065,4017,13,578,19114,13551,872,1866,3217,315,8430,19781,323,33630,994,814,5662,872,4443,25065,4017,627,198,791,10652,1243,29735,311,279,19114,596,1510,3495,2447,11,902,18065,11469,264,502,35876,5507,311,7168,279,36709,2324,315,264,502,3769,430,690,387,1511,304,1841,5596,13,2435,10552,430,814,527,7649,420,3769,304,459,4676,449,1579,38193,11,4528,311,1148,1053,387,1766,304,3738,5961,627,198,791,19114,13551,872,14955,11,27401,430,279,3769,15453,594,1705,279,67038,4787,719,9778,25501,1202,25065,4017,323,330,5192,7977,1,477,9221,8834,343,3340,13,2435,47032,279,12939,315,21630,36709,2324,311,5471,33788,323,6106,7296,627,198,791,10652,45537,449,264,10430,922,279,1205,369,264,810,11944,8830,315,279,24717,16940,36709,2324,13,578,19114,22020,279,12939,315,13126,539,1120,12434,9547,1093,38193,719,1101,10648,12912,11,1778,439,21420,8736,323,15676,315,1841,14365,477,490,15655,627,198,28589,11,420,36815,5825,459,7185,40942,1139,279,1917,315,7384,8198,323,15009,3495,13,128009],"total_duration":10584014051
