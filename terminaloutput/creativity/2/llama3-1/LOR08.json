The journalist is reporting live from the location and expressing her uncertainty about how to evaluate the health of the forest. She notes that scientists have difficulty determining whether a forest is healthy or not, as it's not just a matter of absence of degradation but also requires understanding of ecological functioning.\n\nThe journalist then shares her own research on forest ecosystems and biodiversity, which has led to the development of indicators for tracking ecological state. She mentions studying factors such as minimum surface area for optimal forest development and the amount of dead wood needed to enrich soil.\n\nThe journalist then turns to her thesis research, which focuses on climate change's impact on plant life and ecosystems. She used a large database of plant surveys conducted over several decades to analyze changes in forest types. Her findings suggest that 11% of mountainous forest ecosystems have already shifted towards warmer climates, indicating significant change.\n\nShe also discusses the various threats facing forests, including soil compaction and invasive exotic species. The European Union has set objectives and provided funding for forest conservation efforts since the 1990s. However, the journalist questions whether these efforts are effective in achieving their goals of protecting biodiversity.\n\nTo answer this question, she plans to compare protected forests with unprotected ones, highlighting that her ultimate goal is not just to understand how forests fare but also to ensure they remain in good condition. The broadcast ends with the journalist holding a piece of wood and reflecting on her research.","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,3436,30854,36731,665,2167,409,9757,8511,901,2933,60630,978,76305,5019,97166,326,57286,266,409,20662,369,49530,13,1708,1105,12155,369,5615,2641,42437,22626,82133,84568,14707,13,29124,66,2182,89,11,4864,100164,409,1208,296,46651,11,951,35641,625,2439,11,951,23962,11,951,82711,31355,11,16968,39043,296,6,326,6,1334,294,6,14283,6502,21965,8811,43584,62408,8486,17194,841,829,275,6502,75249,13510,13,356,17771,4725,5019,326,52152,4811,13,11876,7330,333,8467,14848,48488,409,8811,3869,47929,4502,6316,369,49530,11412,14707,6033,6502,13,81245,11427,306,665,48901,4046,838,8977,3625,3026,2492,7930,281,12416,306,1765,27549,1880,3625,7591,70,9011,2641,1744,45602,25692,20028,1345,2852,1370,45973,11,5019,68226,13510,1744,16968,11412,14707,11,326,6,3518,768,409,7591,49241,841,8657,275,6502,13,356,17771,87320,4864,5320,2249,60946,265,4068,1208,369,49530,34501,818,5019,4046,838,8977,4538,14240,266,294,22827,1486,409,48234,91329,1640,2428,13,34447,514,80259,11,272,17771,934,54386,841,25692,6502,25400,7631,261,11,45575,4068,1744,272,17771,3846,5634,258,30,74656,6033,14707,1208,67628,11,3625,92622,66304,11,3625,9259,13,19421,5019,61512,39043,20272,220,605,8261,1744,503,6,2706,81356,14707,25400,1153,261,1208,3488,13,13789,11,4864,841,36731,39040,339,4558,325,41199,16968,3846,27138,11,10071,41199,220,605,8261,11,9952,11083,4631,4558,70,1157,11,17317,14240,664,919,3625,4046,9594,599,66474,13952,4918,1880,28130,56594,1986,13109,5019,19477,52750,951,13519,1759,409,924,33920,409,28130,14240,266,91329,1640,2428,13,1952,513,62163,11,1370,51173,11,409,74940,7479,6316,369,49530,264,63669,5019,513,52895,716,409,85722,7706,1604,6033,35597,1208,10484,13109,409,66304,10237,100243,5019,2018,8977,3869,31518,404,3625,2092,82,13,34447,3663,8065,893,593,409,390,46302,11,3900,379,264,45889,65838,11,389,274,17771,259,3514,978,5553,1208,38317,13,4418,66,11,9952,514,65827,3675,409,1647,4046,61673,11,503,34155,59062,978,6316,270,4558,325,7010,1208,88265,4864,757,17477,26633,4860,13,5034,55133,3613,68495,514,9517,6583,1386,1133,11323,266,2428,13,11876,7330,333,8467,14848,7591,1677,376,978,4538,5536,1765,3625,6136,288,11,10071,389,893,593,35597,409,100246,1765,3625,4046,9594,599,66474,13,622,34155,39587,24560,23008,9211,951,2606,4918,409,79415,5512,409,6136,288,86595,5512,1765,5636,294,22827,97739,9326,1880,4864,3625,16796,51010,28111,5512,7010,6316,25945,25626,2385,409,46681,13,622,41901,16796,7591,47348,3625,4595,409,369,5615,2641,7010,3625,447,2053,46152,84764,1188,24560,86595,5512,13,19421,503,34155,18757,48021,665,4046,28580,1744,46939,665,20605,24812,11,220,806,1034,951,4046,9594,599,66474,13952,4918,14848,4046,12821,96559,5553,951,7625,53819,5636,70412,82,934,49152,519,13,220,806,4,272,17771,653,30870,273,4550,479,46939,77554,14081,481,13,19421,1370,543,4558,1001,3869,39043,11,294,81979,3026,2492,84764,1188,24560,3608,13215,14014,41199,1317,67380,11,22299,1370,51173,514,259,13559,479,951,2092,82,6033,35597,3625,16948,4558,1634,506,354,8467,6233,1494,1056,15844,13,356,17771,87320,11,41199,3625,65838,220,1954,11,326,48968,4176,17317,21559,951,1665,22589,1880,3625,52138,729,294,6,351,404,13,11876,13952,4918,2322,73468,39587,665,2035,951,6299,1765,514,25911,5019,1760,978,1414,1208,369,49530,1880,829,56594,1986,13109,13,34447,1913,54960,11,1826,54312,1744,39043,15572,68,39043,30,356,17771,1208,26633,90272,3488,1744,4864,757,17477,13,9589,54312,1744,3625,3435,8467,78511,14295,665,282,525,324,409,1208,17332,11159,13109,15132,31914,2492,30,9589,54312,1744,12155,9045,15132,8657,285,1821,30,27058,39043,4864,91507,93455,3625,369,5615,2641,7930,15132,1760,19395,14014,9952,19637,645,7930,514,15132,1069,21719,11,66021,1744,11,8065,1620,11,29449,1665,333,308,17771,6502,71357,409,47929,4068,82133,3625,369,5615,2641,13,19421,39043,11,39043,308,17771,934,31109,14240,2070,13,5034,1620,13109,11,272,17771,934,6,37907,779,1188,665,7970,14240,266,13,14465,15119,1557,3930,66304,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,32,8753,3754,13195,922,279,1614,315,264,13952,304,9757,8511,901,2933,13,578,23672,374,13122,3974,505,279,3813,323,37810,1077,27924,922,1268,311,15806,279,2890,315,279,13952,13,3005,8554,430,14248,617,17250,26679,3508,264,13952,374,9498,477,539,11,439,433,596,539,1120,264,5030,315,19821,315,53568,719,1101,7612,8830,315,50953,31301,627,198,791,23672,1243,13551,1077,1866,3495,389,13952,61951,323,73119,11,902,706,6197,311,279,4500,315,34824,369,15194,50953,1614,13,3005,34945,21630,9547,1778,439,8187,7479,3158,369,23669,13952,4500,323,279,3392,315,5710,7732,4460,311,31518,17614,627,198,791,23672,1243,10800,311,1077,17850,3495,11,902,24400,389,10182,2349,596,5536,389,6136,2324,323,61951,13,3005,1511,264,3544,4729,315,6136,32313,13375,927,3892,11026,311,24564,4442,304,13952,4595,13,6385,14955,4284,430,220,806,4,315,16700,788,13952,61951,617,2736,30073,7119,46039,92399,11,19392,5199,2349,627,198,8100,1101,35434,279,5370,18208,13176,36658,11,2737,17614,1391,1335,3
