It seems like you're having a lively discussion about the state of French forests with a journalist. You're explaining that it's difficult to determine if a forest is healthy or not, even for scientists. They can identify threats and damage, but they need more information to evaluate its ecological health.\n\nYou then reveal that you've been studying forest ecosystems and biodiversity for 10 years, trying to develop indicators to track their ecological state. You mention the importance of factors like forest size, dead wood, and climate change in determining a forest's health.\n\nThe journalist is impressed by your findings, which show that 11% of mountain forests have already shifted towards warmer climates due to climate change. You also discuss other threats like soil compaction and invasive exotic species.\n\nYou conclude by saying that while conservation efforts are underway, you're not sure if they're enough to protect the forest's ecological health. You plan to compare protected forests with those that aren't, to see if your efforts are making a difference.\n\nIt seems like a fascinating topic, and I'm happy to have \"listened in\" on your conversation!","done":true,"context":[128006,882,128007,198,198,37292,5859,22755,25,41447,25823,284,510,3436,30854,36731,665,2167,409,9757,8511,901,2933,60630,978,76305,5019,97166,326,57286,266,409,20662,369,49530,13,1708,1105,12155,369,5615,2641,42437,22626,82133,84568,14707,13,29124,66,2182,89,11,4864,100164,409,1208,296,46651,11,951,35641,625,2439,11,951,23962,11,951,82711,31355,11,16968,39043,296,6,326,6,1334,294,6,14283,6502,21965,8811,43584,62408,8486,17194,841,829,275,6502,75249,13510,13,356,17771,4725,5019,326,52152,4811,13,11876,7330,333,8467,14848,48488,409,8811,3869,47929,4502,6316,369,49530,11412,14707,6033,6502,13,81245,11427,306,665,48901,4046,838,8977,3625,3026,2492,7930,281,12416,306,1765,27549,1880,3625,7591,70,9011,2641,1744,45602,25692,20028,1345,2852,1370,45973,11,5019,68226,13510,1744,16968,11412,14707,11,326,6,3518,768,409,7591,49241,841,8657,275,6502,13,356,17771,87320,4864,5320,2249,60946,265,4068,1208,369,49530,34501,818,5019,4046,838,8977,4538,14240,266,294,22827,1486,409,48234,91329,1640,2428,13,34447,514,80259,11,272,17771,934,54386,841,25692,6502,25400,7631,261,11,45575,4068,1744,272,17771,3846,5634,258,30,74656,6033,14707,1208,67628,11,3625,92622,66304,11,3625,9259,13,19421,5019,61512,39043,20272,220,605,8261,1744,503,6,2706,81356,14707,25400,1153,261,1208,3488,13,13789,11,4864,841,36731,39040,339,4558,325,41199,16968,3846,27138,11,10071,41199,220,605,8261,11,9952,11083,4631,4558,70,1157,11,17317,14240,664,919,3625,4046,9594,599,66474,13952,4918,1880,28130,56594,1986,13109,5019,19477,52750,951,13519,1759,409,924,33920,409,28130,14240,266,91329,1640,2428,13,1952,513,62163,11,1370,51173,11,409,74940,7479,6316,369,49530,264,63669,5019,513,52895,716,409,85722,7706,1604,6033,35597,1208,10484,13109,409,66304,10237,100243,5019,2018,8977,3869,31518,404,3625,2092,82,13,34447,3663,8065,893,593,409,390,46302,11,3900,379,264,45889,65838,11,389,274,17771,259,3514,978,5553,1208,38317,13,4418,66,11,9952,514,65827,3675,409,1647,4046,61673,11,503,34155,59062,978,6316,270,4558,325,7010,1208,88265,4864,757,17477,26633,4860,13,5034,55133,3613,68495,514,9517,6583,1386,1133,11323,266,2428,13,11876,7330,333,8467,14848,7591,1677,376,978,4538,5536,1765,3625,6136,288,11,10071,389,893,593,35597,409,100246,1765,3625,4046,9594,599,66474,13,622,34155,39587,24560,23008,9211,951,2606,4918,409,79415,5512,409,6136,288,86595,5512,1765,5636,294,22827,97739,9326,1880,4864,3625,16796,51010,28111,5512,7010,6316,25945,25626,2385,409,46681,13,622,41901,16796,7591,47348,3625,4595,409,369,5615,2641,7010,3625,447,2053,46152,84764,1188,24560,86595,5512,13,19421,503,34155,18757,48021,665,4046,28580,1744,46939,665,20605,24812,11,220,806,1034,951,4046,9594,599,66474,13952,4918,14848,4046,12821,96559,5553,951,7625,53819,5636,70412,82,934,49152,519,13,220,806,4,272,17771,653,30870,273,4550,479,46939,77554,14081,481,13,19421,1370,543,4558,1001,3869,39043,11,294,81979,3026,2492,84764,1188,24560,3608,13215,14014,41199,1317,67380,11,22299,1370,51173,514,259,13559,479,951,2092,82,6033,35597,3625,16948,4558,1634,506,354,8467,6233,1494,1056,15844,13,356,17771,87320,11,41199,3625,65838,220,1954,11,326,48968,4176,17317,21559,951,1665,22589,1880,3625,52138,729,294,6,351,404,13,11876,13952,4918,2322,73468,39587,665,2035,951,6299,1765,514,25911,5019,1760,978,1414,1208,369,49530,1880,829,56594,1986,13109,13,34447,1913,54960,11,1826,54312,1744,39043,15572,68,39043,30,356,17771,1208,26633,90272,3488,1744,4864,757,17477,13,9589,54312,1744,3625,3435,8467,78511,14295,665,282,525,324,409,1208,17332,11159,13109,15132,31914,2492,30,9589,54312,1744,12155,9045,15132,8657,285,1821,30,27058,39043,4864,91507,93455,3625,369,5615,2641,7930,15132,1760,19395,14014,9952,19637,645,7930,514,15132,1069,21719,11,66021,1744,11,8065,1620,11,29449,1665,333,308,17771,6502,71357,409,47929,4068,82133,3625,369,5615,2641,13,19421,39043,11,39043,308,17771,934,31109,14240,2070,13,5034,1620,13109,11,272,17771,934,6,37907,779,1188,665,7970,14240,266,13,14465,15119,1557,3930,66304,13,2331,256,128009,128006,78191,128007,198,198,3923,264,50189,10652,0,1102,5084,1093,499,2351,3515,264,49277,10430,922,279,1614,315,8753,36658,449,264,23672,13,1472,2351,26073,430,433,596,5107,311,8417,422,264,13952,374,9498,477,539,11,1524,369,14248,13,2435,649,10765,18208,323,5674,11,719,814,1205,810,2038,311,15806,1202,50953,2890,627,198,2675,1243,16805,430,499,3077,1027,21630,13952,61951,323,73119,369,220,605,1667,11,4560,311,2274,34824,311,3839,872,50953,1614,13,1472,6420,279,12939,315,9547,1093,13952,1404,11,5710,7732,11,323,10182,2349,304,26679,264,13952,596,2890,627,198,791,23672,374,25408,555,701,14955,11,902,1501,430,220,806,4,315,16700,36658,617,2736,30073,7119,46039,92399,4245,311,10182,2349,13,1472,1101,4358,1023,18208,1093,17614,1391,1335,323,53354,39418,9606,627,198,2675,32194,555,5605,430,1418,29711,9045,527,38199,11,499,2351,539,2771,422,814,2351,3403,311,6144,279,13952,596,50953,2890,13,1472,3197,311,9616,2682,36658,449,1884,430,7784,956,11,311,1518,422,701,9045,527,3339,264,6811
